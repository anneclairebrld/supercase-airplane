So that meant I had 2 hours of queuing to check in, go through customs and security leaving it very fine to get my flight. Luckily, the flight was delayed by 1 hour 30 so there was no rush. The boarding process was confusing and disorganised with continual announcements apologising for delays, calling babies, children, rows and a reminder that seats EFGH boarded through gate A, seats ABCD boarded through gate B. The FAS were ok. Apart from when they left our food on our trays for 40 minutes, I took our trays up in the end and they said they forgot. They also left a full cup of coffee in the holder for landing despite us trying to ask them to take it away. Food was not great especially the tub of apple puré/ baby food and a bread roll for breakfast. The in flight entertainment was limited for English speakers and we arrived late so I missed my connecting flight. They also left baggage from everyone who connected from Saint Martin in Point a Pitre. Which was weird considering we were delayed. I called customer service to try and upgrade my flight in the hope an upgrade would make the return journey less unpleasant.

They cancelled our flight back from Paris due to ""operational difficulties"" and said they could only book us on a flight 2 days later. They would not refund us the money for the flight even though they could not offer anything even close to what we booked. Their customer service just sent us in circles: call this number, call back tomorrow, submit a ticket here, email this address, call this other number.

2018-04-21,True,"""improvements can be made""",  Pointe-à-Pitre to Paris Orly. Good service on this route in Classe Madras (business class). Flight took off and arrived on time. A good dinner was served shortly after take-off and a breakfast shortly before landing. The cabin crew were friendly and professional. However I have to say that I prefer the layout in the business class on their A330. The layout on this newer aircraft certainly has more functions but it looked quite cumbersome and crowded to me. Incredibly the selection of French songs was also very limited. Lounge in Pointe-à-Pitre was also quite small and very limited food ( good if you are on a diet as they were very slow to replenish the food supply ). Overall I think Air Caraïbes is good for this route but a few improvements can be made.,Solo Leisure,Pointe-à-Pitre,Paris Orly,April 2018,7,yes,4,4,4,4,4,,A350-900
2017-12-23,True,"""never fly Air Caraïbes again""","  Saint Martin to Paris Orly via Pointe à Pitre. Not an experience I'd like to repeat. First, my French isn't great so I had to find out at Pointe a Pitre that I needed to check in but I didn't need to pick up my hold baggage. So that meant I had 2 hours of queuing to check in, go through customs and security leaving it very fine to get my flight. Luckily, the flight was delayed by 1 hour 30 so there was no rush. The boarding process was confusing and disorganised with continual announcements apologising for delays, calling babies, children, rows and a reminder that seats EFGH boarded through gate A, seats ABCD boarded through gate B. The FAS were ok. Apart from when they left our food on our trays for 40 minutes, I took our trays up in the end and they said they forgot. They also left a full cup of coffee in the holder for landing despite us trying to ask them to take it away. Food was not great especially the tub of apple puré/ baby food and a bread roll for breakfast. The in flight entertainment was limited for English speakers and we arrived late so I missed my connecting flight. They also left baggage from everyone who connected from Saint Martin in Point a Pitre. Which was weird considering we were delayed. I called customer service to try and upgrade my flight in the hope an upgrade would make the return journey less unpleasant. My french isn't great which I explained but the customer service girl lost patience and cut me off.

However a couple weeks before we received a schedule change which meant that we had a return from Pointe a Pitre 1 day earlier and then because we had a flight back to the UK on our original return date we had to spend alot of money of a hotel in Paris Orly as we we returning one day early. Air Caraibes refused to provide us with a hotel or a refund and instead mentioned that we should make a claim after our travel. I made a claim to Air Caraibes at the beginning of October 2017 however they have not replied. I have sent another email for compensation so fingers cross I will get a response.

I explained to Opodo that I booked this ticket 9 months ago and I also booked a connecting flight from Paris Orly to London on the same day that my flight has been now changed to which means that I will miss my Connection. Opodo mentioned that they could not do anything and I would have to speak with Air Caraibes. I transferred to Air Caraibes and the staff did not even give me a chance to speak, she was very rude and told me to go speak to Opodo and did not want to listen, I was speaking to her for about 1 minute. This service was very disgusting as I had booked 2 premium class tickets and I was expecting some sort of understand. I called back Opodo and explained what had happened and they didnt really care, I have asked Opodo to give me a full refund as my return flight has been changed for a different day and they are unable to give me an alternative flight for the day I booked to leave. It was even more upsetting as I check Skyscanner and found many other carriers offering flights however Opodo mentioned that the airline does not have alliance with these carriers.

They don't speak English and rarely do they ever reply to you (and even if they do, that will be in French of course). Online check-in is fake - it doesn't work before the flight and they refuse to help you with that over the phone or email. Their employees at the airport are very unfriendly and completely unhelpful when met in person - you see that you are a burden for them when you need help at the airport. Besides, the airline lost my baggage and it can't be traced any more at all. Conclusion: if possible, try to avoid this terrible airline, it's the worst French airline for sure, low-costs show you more respect and understanding than this horrible airline.
