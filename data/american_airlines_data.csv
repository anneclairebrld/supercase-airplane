0,"  Greensboro to Las Vegas via Charlotte. I will never fly American again! I fly 4-8 times a week for work. Every time I fly them something happens .. delays, cancellations, rude employees. This latest event happened when a flight from Charlotte was delayed due to air traffic at the Charlotte airport we were headed to. We left 30 mins late and then circled the Charlotte airport for another extra 15 mins. More than half the plane missed their connections. When I finally got off my commuter plane I ran (a mile it seemed) to catch my connection. I had 15 mins before it was due to take off. I arrived at the gate to find they had closed the flight (plane still there) and I wouldn't be allowed to board. I asked them why they didn't hold the plane knowing I was a delayed flight. I was told that no one contacted them to tell them to hold it. WTF! I'm so tired of American having. No regard for travelers plans. This doesn't happen with other airlines! I can choose who to fly and I will never fly American again. I will drive before I ever take a commuter plane with them and I now know that American doesn't care about me as a traveler."
1,"Not Verified |  Tokyo to Dallas. I was dreading this flight, I had booked on American by mistake, and expected an awful experience. However, I was amazed by how good the flight was. As I stepped aboard, instead of the usual demand for my boarding card, the FA said ""you look like you know where you are going, I won't stop you"". The flight was full, and the economy cabin is tight, but it was just comfortable enough. The meals were tasty, freshly served and certainly adequate. A huge shout out to the male flight attendant in my section (row 21). He had fantastic customer facing skills. A real credit to the airline."
2,"  Providence to Tucson via Chicago. American Airlines is the most unorganized and unprofessional carrier. Poor planning and customer service, impossible to change flights, flights are delayed. They're an absolute joke, I'll never fly with them again. Spend the extra $20 and go with a different airline, it'll save you so many headaches"
3,"Not Verified |  Philadelphia to Boston. Horrible customer service, they kept bouncing me around to different gates and it was obvious they did not care and really did not want to help the customers. I will never fly AA if I can help it!"
4,"  Houston to Dallas. I had departed from American Airlines as on time stated, but arrived late, because they could not find any gate to drop of us off for about 17 minutes. Thus, I missed my connecting flight to my destination. This made me upset, because I was expecting to show up on the time I wanted to and now, I have to deal 7 hours of delay for another route all the way to Paris to get a connecting flight towards Ho Chi Minh City. The lady who assisted was nice and did her effort to help me as much as possible to arrive early, not to mention she also compensated me for a meal voucher due to this issue, which I am thankful for it. Still frustrated that I have to deal with delays and lack of rest. I will not ever fly American Airlnes anymore due to this experience. Do yourself a favor, don't ever think about American Airlines, especially if you are traveling abroad. Look elsewhere."
5,"Not Verified |  Tampa to Manchester. Original flight was delayed so could not get connecting flight up the whole East coast to get home, was forced to reschedule for the following day, was not comped in any way, had to sleep in the airport because all hotels around the area where several hundred dollars. Do not fly American Airlines, they will charge you a fortune to change, they strand you they just don't care about you."
6,"  Charlotte to Fayetteville. This was the worst flying experience I have ever had. Delays on all flights, did not seat any of us together. Flight attendants were mean, as we had 2 kids that had never flown that had to sit with complete strangers. I have always flown Delta that accommodates your needs. I decided to try American and learned that was a mistake. I spent 1200 on tickets that was gonna be a nice 2 day weekend, but spent most of it at airports and separated from family."
7,  Athens to Philadelphia. I was informed my tv did not work. This has happened to me at least three times before. I was the last one to bord the plane instead of me boarding first. They gave me a hand held one and it took a couple of hours for it to work. When I got back home I called customer service and it took three different times of me calling to get them to give me some kind of compensation. They kept on giving me a phone number to call them back that did NOT work. Finally they gave me a $250 voucher that expires in a year. I paid a lot of money for this ticket for the experience and they blew me off with $250 dollars. The stewardess on the plane was very nice and understanding. Customer service is another story. This airline sucks. I will never travel with them again.
8,"  Los Angeles to Syracuse via Charlotte. There is always an issue when you fly with American Airlines! Since my son’s initial flight at LAX is delayed, he will definitely miss his connecting flight at ORD. Therefore he will most likely miss the important event he was trying to attend in the first place. When my son asked for an alternate flight, he was not even helped at American Airlines customer service; instead he was given a phone number to call and make the new travel arrangements himself. When he called, the service representative told him he would have to wait overnight and take a flight out 24 hours later. These flights that we have previously paid for months in advance, are usually cancelled or postponed, especially on the return flights. It definitely seems like false advertisement when an airline promotes and sells seats on flights for specific dates and times, and then cancel, only so they can cram as many passengers together on one plane as possible. And to make matters worse, my son’s luggage has been loaded on the plane that he cannot even take. We are “told” that he can pick up his luggage when he eventually arrives at his destination, whenever and wherever that is! Airlines such as this one rarely live up to their promises, and they aren’t the least bit concerned in how they greatly inconvenience their passengers. American Airlines really needs to do better by their passengers."
9,"  Charlotte to Seattle. The company has lowered its quality over the years. Last time, they changed our flight unexpectedly. At that time they assure that there was a management issue. Then they came to say that the reason was the weather conditions, even though there was no rain nor snow nor high wind in the departure or arrival cities. Ground service and customer service was constantly contradictory. Besides, as usual, seats are small. Cabin staff scream over the microphone some credit card promotions while people are sleeping. Food is missing. When you purchase a sandwich, the price is 10 dollars for a small, cold piece. "
10,  Detroit to Dallas. I realize that due to weather in Detroit was bad. We missed our connecting flight. AA made very little effort to help us to make our connecting. We only missed it by 2 min. And we was stuck here in Dallas for 10 hrs. I can’t remember the last time I flew AA. But I will make sure it’s the last.
11,"Not Verified |  A truly uncomfortable flight. Because of the short connecting time I paid for a preferred seat nearer the front. What a disaster. Turns out it was a no recline seat; not designated on their charts? On top of that the seat in front of me was clearly a full recline; I estimate 6"" to 8"". I got to spent a full 5+ hours with someones head in my lap as she left the seat reclined even when not sleeping; and had to be prompted to put in in the landing position! The leg room situation was a joke; no space at all. The seat was probably a bit wider; a good thing because I had to sit sideways to clear the magazines. The idea of opening my computer was not viable. I an just under 5'11"". And obviously dumb enough to fly AA's A320's across the country. Not again!"
12,  American Airlines has added a route (AA3016) from San Luis Obispo to Dallas/Ft Worth. Which is a good thing except that 3hrs 23mins in an RJ is just about 1hr 23min too long! I will not try that again. The continuing flight to Boston (AA2579) was excellent in premium economy as I had great leg room. that flight actually left close to an hour late; to American's good fortune the high level winds were running NE and we arrived on time. 
13,"Not Verified |  Worst customer service I can remember in a long time. We planned a trip with our kids for my wife's birthday flying out at 7:00 am. A month after paying a significant amount for these tickets I get an email informing me our departure time was moved to 5:11 am and our return flight that was set for afternoon was moved to 10:00 eliminating any time to enjoy the last day with no discount to our price. We did our best to make it work and at the check in kiosk it didn't allow an option to check back .. apparently we missed the 45 minute limit by a minute. The rude attendant by the time we got her attention said there was nothing she could do we needed to hope we could rebook a later flight. Later we found out this was not true and the attendants at the desk could have checked our luggage up to 30 minutes before which she did not tell us. I ran up to the airport store bought a carry on bag, through what we could in, ran suitcase back to car, and ran to gate as fast as you can with a 6 and 8 year old. As we got there they told us we could not board and the plane was gone .. although it could be clearly seen outside the window. On top of that was the continued most unfriendly customer service experience i've been through in years......couldn't care less and you were lucky they would acknowledge you. Luckily they found us another flight ... 12 hours later and charged us an additional $300 to save those seats. If you can avoid this airline at all costs, there are others that actually pretend like they care and aren't just there to rudely screw you out of every dollar they can."
14, Milwaukee to Lihue via Phoenix. American Airlines is terrible for customer satisfaction. It is the only airline where booking together doesn’t mean you will have seats next to one another. My husband and I booked two tickets to Hawaii from the Midwest. This was over 10 hours of air travel. Not only were our original seats not together (completely unheard of on other airlines) but there were not even two seats together available for the additional charges if picking a seat. I understand charging to make a specific seat selection but getting two seats together should be a basic courtesy when booking two flights together. I will never fly this airline again. Convinced me that I am a Delta customer for life - even when the costs are more.
15,  Lost my luggage for 4 days while trying to move into college. Has all of my belongings. Was told To go buy the everything I needed while my luggage was missing. I did. Now they refuse to cover any of my expenses! Implied that I was lying about my luggage missing. Obviously I have several calls with American regarding this matter. It’s unbelievable on how unprofessional and non customer friendly they are. I will never fly them again. 
16,"Not Verified | Puerto Rico to Heathrow via Charlotte. American Airlines planes are great, shame about the staff. Very rude to passengers, when you ask a question you will be told: “I was actually on my break""! Food was not great for a long flight. Totally spoiled the holiday, I will avoid in future. "
17,"Not Verified |  Worst customer service. When we got to Punta Cana airport my partner asked the attendant in the front desk if we could change the seats. This is already annoying as months back when we booked the flight, we chose seats together. They said the flight was full so they wouldn’t be able to do that. We notice the entire four rows of the back of the plane were empty. Once doors closed we asked again one of the flight attendants if we could sit together on the empty seats, she rudely responded no. Let’s not forget this is almost a four hour flight were they offer you nasty cookies and to top off the flight attendants were incapable of serving drinks without spilling them. The attendant spilled ice all over the side of my arm and another lady got a whole soda spilled on her. American Airlines step up your game. You already have one of the most uncomfortable seating accommodations for planes and to top it off your customer service is trash."
18,"Not Verified |  Charleston to Washington. This is, time and time again, the worst airline I have ever been on. Not only is the staff extremely disrespectful, the plane is late every time. For the past 7 flights I have unwillingly taken with American, every one has been delayed. They are unprofessional, not punctual, and unaccommodating. The only positive thing about American Airlines is that they are cheaper. I do not recommend this airline."
19,"Not Verified | Indianapolis to Palm Springs via Dallas. This is not a review of a specific flight. It is about the company’s complete lack of customer service. I have been flying American Airlines my whole life and it is appalling how they mishandle every simple detail of what it requires to make your experience at least bearable. The website is unintelligible. My husband is dying of cancer and they said it would cost $2200. to transfer his 168,000 miles to my account. I have now been on hold for 20 minutes trying to book award travel."
20,"Not Verified |  Cedar Rapids to Miami. Left Cedar Rapids on the 6:50 am flight, spent 45 minutes at the check in counter with a lady that was incompetent. Barely made to the gate in time to get on the plane. Got to Charlotte and boarding passes were all screwed up. spent an hour at customer service desk trying to get tickets fixed to get on the next plane. Barely made that flight and got to Miami and they told me they forgot to take my bag off the plane. Told me they would get hot right away and deliver it to the hotel. When I got to the Hotel and told the counter gal that they would be bringing my bag she laughed and said AA is the worst, they see this at the hotel all the time and that they probably would never deliver my bag. Checked and AA said that it was picked up by a driver at 3:27 and I would have it by 7:27. Checked at 7:30 and it said that it was picked up at 7:27 and I would see it by 9:00 pm. Called the 800 # and they had a terrible attitude and said I should see it within 12 hours. Said the driver probably had a medical Emergency. Stay away. No regard for customer service. These people don't care."
21," London to New York JFK. A trip of contrasting flights - outbound was rammed full. I was sat in the middle aisle of 4 and the experience was sub-Ryanair. Zero space, zero comfort. As compensation IFE was good. Food was dreadful. Return leg, much lighter load and I secured the economy travellers’ holy grail of 4 seats to myself - economy business come on down! I got this flight very cheaply on a basic economy basis, no bags, no seat selection. I would have paid to choose a different seat, but non-US credit cards are not accepted on the app which is a bit rubbish!"
22,  San Francisco to Los Angeles. I was made to check in my hand luggage for no apparent reason in a rude and unprofessional manner! Their planes are old and the service below zero. Never fly with them.
23,"  Milwaukee to Cedar Rapids via Chicago. My son flew home from college in December then back to college today. Both times were with American and both times we had issues. When he flew out of Cedar Rapids there was a huge delay because of mechanical issues, which caused him to miss his connecting flight in Chicago, so instead of getting in at 8pm he got in at almost midnight. This time on his way out of Milwaukee they overfueled the plane causing a delay making him miss his connecting flight in Chicago. When he got in to Chicago the American Airlines employees would not help him. They gave him the latest flight to Cedar Rapids meaning he has to sit around for over 8 hours. Not his fault that again they messed up and had issues. They didn't offer him vouchers for food or try to get him on a different airline to Cedar Rapids. When Customer Service was called by me, they wouldn't help. A simple call to get my kid taken care of in some way. Such a hassle for literally a 30 minute flight. Plus I had to sit on hold for over 30 minutes waiting for them to answer. We will not use American Airlines again."
24," The absolute worst. Had a connecting flight from Dallas, Texas to Narita, Tokyo. It was originally delayed because of some cart issue that couldn’t push the plane away from the gate. Then delayed due to a paperwork issue. Then delayed waiting for the mechanic to come on board to check the nose wheel so the aircraft was safe for takeoff. Then cancelled because the forward landing gear was damaged and wasn’t safe to fly. The staff was less than pleasant to the passengers, and they couldn’t rebook any passengers at the counter until we arrived in Narita past 10 pm because no flights depart Narita past 10 pm. So now this results in overnight in Tokyo because connecting flights aren’t even available. Every time I’ve flown with AA I’ve had either 5+ hour delays or cancellations. This is one of the most atrocious airlines I’ve ever experienced, and I’ve been a flier with AA for the past 10+ years. I’m done with this airline for the rest of my life. Infuriating."
25," Peoria to Dallas with American Airlines. This airline allows 50 pounds maximum on each bag. My one bag had 45 pounds while the other had 53 pound.s They could have allowed this bags. But I was told to transfer 3 pounds to other bag to balance the 50 pounds. It took me 5 min and I have to miss my flight. I had to wait for 9 hours for next flight. Mean while my original flight was day before and got cancelled due to bad weather. My whole experience was pathetic and due to their baggage policy it got worse. I always go for Southwest, but they don't come to Peoria."
26,  Miami to La Guardia. Worst experience ever. My baggage has been lost and no one is taking responsibility.No one knows what there job is it’s all about money they dont care for your security or luggage highly not recommended.
27,"  Omaha to Lihue via Los Angeles. American has lost any sight of customer service. It's bad enough our flight was delayed, and once we were inflight and had to turn around for mechanical issues, they made no attempt to help customers get rebooked when we landed. The gate agent was the rudest, most inept person I've seen - and I fly a lot for business. I had to call American and had someone help me on the phone - he said I needed to return to gate agent to finish the rebooking, the agent screwed up and our luggage didn't get switched. I specifically asked him to make sure he did a luggage transfer. As if that wasn't bad enough, AA couldn't locate our lost luggage the next day. We filed reports online, and our bags showed as at the Lihue airport; but they couldn't find them. The lack of customer concern was astounding - we traveled to Hawaii from Nebraska and they had zero since of care or urgency. We called the AA lost baggage line and they said repeatedly the bags weren't located. We finally went to airport again, went into the American baggage office and all the bags were just sitting there. We showed the clerk our luggage tags, assuming she'd want to check off her list that we took our luggage, but she wasn't interested. Hours later, I received a phone call from AA luggage, asking for my claim numbers etc and to discuss our luggage. They didn't want to use any process when we were standing there but wanted to interrupt my vacation to talk paperwork. I'm not surprised you are losing customers, getting low ratings etc. You should be embarrassed about how we were treated."
28,  Philadelphia to Kansas City. Airline was late to arrive at airport - due to mechanical issues .. seems to be a very common occurrence as it has happened several times in the last 12 months. After departure we flew for 2 hours to reach the destination only to be told that they could not land due to weather. So they routed us back to the origination. Yes another 2 hours. Only to be told that they would not comp meals or hotel because it was a weather related issue. Flight crew and gate agents could have cared less. I fly every month and this airline is in trouble!
29,"  Los Angeles to London. The airplane toilets were out of order causing long queues. Although there were seats available for my husband and I to sit together, they sat us apart demanding that we pay $120 extra for the isle seat near the toilet where the queue for the toilet was. Completely unacceptable, airline trying to make max profit by separating a family. Uncomfortable seats, below average quality food."
30,Not Verified |  Miami to Philadelphia. Worst airline experience ever! Flew them to the destination and back. The party that was traveling together got split up. They refused to assign our seats together. Then I was 3 pounds overweight on my check in bag and they charged me an additional $100 on top of the $30 that I paid to check it in the first place. Airline is nothing but a money grubbing business that does not care about its customers. I will never fly American Airlines again. Staff were constantly rude and seemed annoyed to answer questions. Chose another airline if you have the option.
31,"  Salt Lake City to Dallas Ft Worth. Our flight was supposed to depart Salt Lake at 1:39. It was delayed until 5:30 because of mechanical issues and then the crew had to be swapped out because of the pilots hours and a new crew had to be located and flown in to fly the plane. On the original part of the trip, this same thing occurred leaving Dallas to Salt Lake and we were two hours delayed, but that crew was able to switch planes with us. I will never fly American again. They are zero for two of my experience. They don’t even appear bothered by it as it seems they are used to this type of problems."
32,"Not Verified |  Salt Lake City to Dallas Ft Worth. Worst airline ever. Delayed from 1:40 until midnight. originally delayed until 6:30. We boarded the plan and were promptly told there were no pilots or flight crew, and were forced to deboard, where we received a delay until midnight, where they couldn’t even guarantee that we’d have a plane to board. Every time I’ve flown American, there has always been a problem. Don’t fly with them, because they don’t value your time."
33," Cleveland to Philadelphia via San Juan. Worst first time experience, not recommended. Bad attitude from the ladies upfront. They lied and fooled me. I was unaware that they had put me on a standby. My son had just passed away. They didn't make me aware. They told me I would fly on the next flight, they lied. They gave it to someone else even though I had been waiting for so long. I started getting panic attacks and I didn't have any medication with me. I would get to final destination at 3am with no one to pick me up. I was lost for words, I couldn't believe it. I know my family and friends will never cross paths with American Airlines again."
34," First, I would like to make note of the flight attendants. We had two really great and humorous flight attendants who did what they could to make our interactions enjoyable. However, I will avoid flying with this airline in the future for the following reasons: 1) Seating. They will not seat you with your family or friends unless you purchased this option. You will likely be separated from them, even if you purchased tickets at the same time. 2) No online check-in. Despite the terms saying that you can check-in online 24 hours prior to flying (where you supposedly can arrange seats on international flights), this is not allowed for international flights. I attempted to log-in multiple times the day before flying and calling the airline, but wait times were over an hour. I spoke to other passengers who also were unable to check-in online before the flight and this experience was the same. 3) The food is not good. I ordered the Asian-vegetarian meal in advance which normally means on the Atlantic US flights that you'll get Indian food. The rice was undercooked and it was so incredibly spicy my stomach hurt. 4) The flight attendants weren't working. Despite my positive interactions with the flight attendants, I saw them taking a lot of breaks. The airline had blocked the entire back middle row (4 seats across). I understand they need breaks, however, I have never seen flight attendants reading and watching films. Shouldn't these seats be available to the passengers? Not once did I see them walking around offering beverages during the pauses in between meals. 5) The seats are awful. I got stuck in the seat in front of the bathroom on the side. This seat barely reclines and the seat in front of me was broken and the woman left her seat reclined the entire time, so I was unable to properly view the screen or have much space to move."
35,"Not Verified |  LaGuardia to Savannah. I had seats reserved along with 5 other active duty military members, yet we were kicked off because “there weren’t enough seats” for everyone. We waited for about 2 hours for them to tell us what would happen next. They couldn’t give us a voucher for another flight at another airport for the same day, when we had orders to be back the same night. Instead, we were given separate tickets for early the next morning at 5:55, onto another connecting flight which would not arrive at our destination until 2 pm. Stay away from this airline as even I thought all of the other reviews were exaggerated about this place."
36,"Not Verified |  Worst airline experience consistently over the past years. You cannot preselect seats unless you pay for them on international flights. They randomly assign seats apart from each other when you booked the tickets together, and the only way you can get seats together before getting to the gate is to pay online for assigned seats. We arrived at Philadelphia airport and the luggage’s took 45 minutes to come out. All in all, AA’s service has really gone down hill in the past years while their profit sore."
37,"Not Verified |  I booked a reservation for 3 passengers. Being an AAdvantage member the price includes 3 bags for the travelers. Unfortunately, I misspelled my wife's first name. I called American Airlines and they created a new and separate reservation for wife. They also charged my wife for baggage and told me there was nothing they could do about it but I should request a refund after the trip and it would be granted. When I requested the refund it was denied without explanation. I will never fly American again. Beware of false promises. Flight to Newark was also delayed an hour due to a co-pilot emergency and ground crew leaving site for another flight."
38,"  I had a two hour delay in Atlanta that caused me to miss my connecting flight to Virginia. I then had a 3 hour layover in North Carolina, once it was finally time to get on my next flight it was delayed 15-30 mins. I finally got on my flight to Virginia and once I landed I went to get my bag. They lost it in transit. I spoke to a gentlemen at American Airline baggage claim and he told me he needed a baggage ticket, I informed him I never received one. He then told me well you should have. Then he said he has know clue where the bag is, come to find out it was in the airport and now I have to wait for the next day in order to get my bag."
39,"Not Verified |  Guadalajara to Washington Dulles. It was mid morning/day and I bought a fragile small statue of baby Jesus. I had 2 of them. Then when I got back home and I opened the package with bubble wrap it was broken. it’s American’s fault because they probably throw the luggage very hard into the cargo.  I have a baby and we went to the baggage claim and we were waiting and waiting a long time because we got everything except the car seat. So we went to the oversized baggage center and apparently when the car seat came out it was broken. Plus they didn’t put a plastic wrapping on on it. The last time I flew to Phoenix, Arizona I flew with Frontier Airlines and when I went to the baggage claim to pick up my car seat for my baby it did have that plastic wrapping so it could protect it."
40,  The review is 1 in a scale from 1 to 10. The people who answer the phone do not care about the clients at all. They charge for a change in a flight $300 plus a lot of more money. I find very insensitive the personnel and primary the policy of American Airlines. I will not use this airline any longer when I buy a ticket. There are many other airlines who have a heart and care about their passengers.
41,"  Salt Lake City to Los Angeles. American airlines is the worst airline, they changed my flight twice even before getting on the plane. Then canceled my flight home leaving me with one lost day of vacation and not being able to use my paid hotel and rental car. When I asked for any accommodation they said no,vthis happens all the time"
42,"  Phoenix to London with a very short layover in Dallas. I was really stressed about the short connection time. I approached the gate attendant and asked her if she could find me a seat closer to the front. She ignored my question and said “your roller bag cannot fly!”. I always fly with this roller bag. The bag was indeed about an inch too tall, but she would not budge. She said it would be $186 to check it. Absolutely unbelievable. I asked for a supervisor, and the sup, was even more insulting. Her explanation was “it’s a business!” I ended up having to ditch the roller bag and some clothes to pack my stuff in a smaller bag I purchased. They only care about money. They couldn’t care less about your experience."
43,"  Phoenix to Guayaquil via Dallas. Traveling to Ecuador from Phoenix through a connection in Dallas with my husband to see my sick father in-law. First we arrived to the airport in Phoenix super early just in case there was long lines but checkin went very smooth but after that everything went wrong. As we are waiting for the flight we get multiple notifications that our flight is being delayed. After the fourth delay notification we went to customer service to see what the issue was and if we were going to make our international connection. After talking to them for a while, we found out the plane was late leaving LA due to a baggage problem and after them contacting the POC it was decided to try the flight to Dallas in hopes that for some reason the our international flight was delayed, due to the time of year, that we might be able to make it and if not we were told that they would rebook us to the next flight, which was the following night, and they would get us a hotel on them. We tried and took the delayed flight to Dallas on their recommendation. Unfortunately we missed our international flight so we went to customer service now in Dallas as we were told to do in Phoenix and were told that they were going to give us nothing! The customer service employee was the rudest, least helpful person I have every met. She said that the flight was delayed due to bad weather in Phoenix (which was not true plus we were told it was a baggage problem in LA that caused the delay) and that since it was a weather problem they are not responsible to give us anything. We explained to her what we were told in Phoenix that if we missed the flight due to their delay we would get a hotel and meal vouchers since the next flight to Ecuador was not for another 24 hours. She told us it was not her problem and that she could give us a number to call for discounted rates for a hotel or send us back to Phoenix. So now my husband and I are stuck in Dallas for 24 hours with nothing. Not even our bags because since our final destination was not Dallas the bags were put in a storage room to be put on the Ecuador flight the next evening. We left the terminal basically in tears because we dont have any money for a hotel or anything because we have been scraping and saving money for this trip. We went to the baggage people to see if by chance we could get our bags to at least change clothes or brush our teeth since everything was in our checked bags. The workers there were very nice and said that is was not right and sent us to another person who eventually gave us a hotel and meal voucher. Our flight from Phoenix landed at 6:00pm. The missed flight to Ecuador took off at 5:35pm. By the time anything got resolved and after being sent to different people, we got a hotel at 1:00am. The other people we talked to, baggage claim and eventually upper management were all very nice and understanding, but Charo, who's title is customer service was less then worthless and rude. All we wanted was what were we told we would get after taking their recommendation to still take that flight instead of being rerouted another way. And to be told that it was not her problem after paying $2000.00 for this trip to now missing a flight due to their delay and missing an entire day with an ailing family member; I have never felt so defeated and just lied too."
44,"Not Verified |  So after a mistake that AA made after a canceled flight, I was given a travel voucher to refund my money (only have about 10 hours of contacting customer service). I've used an evoucher before, so I assumed that's what they would send me this time. Instead, I receive a paper voucher that can only be used via the phone, or directly at the airport itself 12 days in advance. Please tell me - who comes to the airport 12 days in advance to buy a ticket? (when you can easily/more cheaply by online). And you would have to pay me to spend any time on the phone with AA trying to make a reservation over the phone). So I basically lost $250 dollars, as using the voucher for toilet paper is about as useful as their paper travel vouchers are. After being a loyal customer for 10 years, I am done with this airline!"
45,"Not Verified | Charlotte to Buffalo. Awful! I will never fly American again. They had us sit in their cabin for almost 40 minutes, caused us to almost miss our connecting flight home and then proceeded to lose our luggage. Fly Southwest - they are much better!"
46,Not Verified |  Dallas to Columbus. We have been at airport for over an hour at 11 pm and there are 5 American flights all at the same baggage claim and all been waiting at least 45 minutes for bags to arrive. When we arrived at airport there was no ground crew to guide us into gate. Complete mismanagement and disorganization from American Airlines.
47,"  Grand Rapids to Chicago. This airline is not for their customers, or the military. They will make false promises and scam you out of your money. If you fly with them, get insurance on your tickets. They have no customer service, and those you may speak with are rude, demeaning, impatient, and do not want to help you. This has been the case for my last several flights. Additionally, they work on their time, not yours. Do not expect any information, or to make a flight, if you have to depend on their assistance."
48,"Not Verified |  Atlanta to Dallas. Our flight was at 6:45 in the morning we arrived at the airport at 4:45. When we walked to checkin it was too confusing. There were kiosks where you would get the tags to your bag then there was bag drop. None of it made sense. We had a problem where our tickets were booked separately and we had 6 bags for five people which is pretty good for my family we could only check 5 for some dumb reason. We took about an hour figuring this out then got to security for 15 minutes then got to our gate, when we got there we had a stroller for the baby and the staff were confusing us on what to do even when knew what to do. The one time I got a window seat there was no window and I was in the center of the plane. They only had the biscof cookies and nothing else. I would definitely try to avoid this airline."
49,  American Airlines sold my seat after their connecting flight was delayed. My son and I approached as they were shutting the door before the actual flight time. They said you missed it and put me on a flight 5 hours later. I had paid for assigned seats and earlier entry but the second flight was separated from my son and last on the plane. When I filed a complaint they said sorry you didn't like it but that is all we are gonna do. Fly another airline.
50,"  Ontario to Phoenix. I’m traveling back to work from home as I was home on holiday. I get to the airport which was enough of a disaster, and I get through security about 20 minutes prior to my boarding time. I get to my gate, take a seat, and prepare for my flight as I have several today. I’m sitting at my gate as I write this out. Everyone is here at the gate, prepared to board and out comes an announcement from our gate. “Attention to all passengers boarding this flight, we cannot board anyone on this plane until all crew members are present. It’s written in their contract. There’s a flight attendant missing and she won’t be here for another 45 minutes, please bear with us.” Are you kidding? You announce this at 0530, our boarding time. Shouldn’t be that hard to be here on time for people who literally paid to get on this flight at 0530. Not to mention the terrible customer service in general, uncomfortable riding conditions, and the overall trash that is American Airlines. Will not be flying American ever again."
51,"  Denver to Fort Myers via Dallas. I strongly regret flying with American Airlines who perform poorly in every aspect. Worst of all, their employees do not care one bit.  I regret that I did not see all the negative reviews before booking. I know that I will never fly with this miserable company again."
52," The seat was hard as a rock. Checked in in plenty of time. Luggage missed the plane because ""short-handed"". Turned over to lost and found. Suitcase meant to be at 3.30 PM and then by 8.30 PM. Don't know when now."
53,  Albuquerque to Huntsville via Dallas Ft Worth. Travelling during holiday season for a funeral - i think i could have gotten better service from a machine. To the attendent who was at b26 dfw for the 8.47 pm flight from dfw to hsv on 12/30/2019 yo need a heart. The ABQ to DFW flight was delayed. I was at the gate at 8.37 running across terminals to get to the funeral next day. Staff did not have the courtesy to greet me - ignored me. When I told you that I am on this flight you told me that you had to close the gate in 30 secs. Staff dismissively said to go to the customer service desk. 
54,"Not Verified |  Worst air travel experience I have ever had. We took a flight from SEA to AVP airport with a stopover in PHL. The flight from SEA landed 20 minutes late, only allowing us 10 minutes to catch our connecting flight. We arrived 2 minutes after boarding was closed. I overheard other passengers expressing call concerns of missing their connecting flight, the flight attendant told them 35 minutes would be plenty of time to get to your connecting flight, however we didn't get 35 minutes because we were in the back rows, we had 10 and weren't able to make it from Gate A to F at PHL. When we went to ""customer service"" they advised that the only other available flight they had was to some airport I was unfamiliar with, 15 hours later. As I was on a schedule, that was not an acceptable solution to AA's mistake so I was forced to rent a car and bear the inconvenience of driving to my destination. I have filed a complaint on their website however the only response I've been able to get is from their Twitter, which hasn't been much help either. The customer service running their social media refunded me a pathetic $80 or something like that. I continued to flood Twitter so someone in customer relations  called me to discuss my experience. She was completely worthless as well. All she did was explain their policy. I did get $200 in vouchers for a future flight, but unfortunately I have to fly with AA so I will probably sell them at a fraction. Somehow it's against company policy to refund $80 more but whatever. I ended up disputing the difference with my credit card company and got it back. Avoid this company at all costs!"
55,"Not Verified |  Very disappointing trip. Started Dec 23 with a 2 hour delay that left me missing my connecting flight in Dallas/Fort Worth to not arrive at my final destination until 12.56 am the next morning when I was to arrive at 8pm initial day. Then when trying to fly back Dec 29, due to mechanical difficulties, my 7.56 pm flight gets delayed until 6am the next morning which causes me to miss work the next day as American Airlines cannot get me to any airport to get a connecting flight until mid morning. Not happy and feel that American Airlines will not be my airline of choice for any future flights as you cannot make any plans until you know you have landed."
56,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Wichita. I will never fly AA again. After what is the fifth hour of delays, switching aircraft three times on one set of flights to and from our vacation, all after the planes loaded and significant waiting time while loaded, to be unloaded and ridiculously delayed, moved to different planes, they are truly an atrocious business. I have never had good experiences with American and these last two flights have been the last straw in a burning bale of hay with this airline. I will be paying more money or taking longer flights to avoid all future travel and encourage others to do the same until America gets it’s act together."
57,"Not Verified |  Took 7.5 hrs to “find” 4 bags. We never left the airport .. we got there on time for a departure to Dallas, TX. We were delayed an hr due to weather but then boarded the plane. After a little over 2 hrs, we were then forced to deplane because the pilot’s hours were timed out. We received help pretty quickly and were told to pick up our bags for baggage claim. We then waited for over 3 hours to be told over and over again that our bags were coming shortly. My husband and I finally gave up and went to eat. We came back a couple of hours later (around 9:45pm-10pm) and our bags weren’t there. The excuse that they originally gave us was that there were only 2 people unloading planes because of a shift change and they were doing on-time flights as a priority .. it’s not like anyone can control the weather and the circumstances that follow after bad weather. After a ridiculous amount of hours waiting, we finally got our bags. We were never offered any kind of upgrade or anything for our wait time. Ridiculous service. We will never fly American Airlines again."
58,  I am traveling for the first time with my service dog. My flight from Dubuque to Chicago and Seattle was cancelled due to fog. The service attendant Andrew was so helpful to me. He was able to get me scheduled on later flight to Chicago and then Alaska Airlines from Chicago to Seattle. TSA was also very helpful. Thank you all for your care.
59," American Airlines are terrible. Made me get off the plane to search my bag even though I told them there was no lithium battery. Further delaying my (already delayed) flight, they made me unpack and unzip every part of my suitcase to search for a lithium battery. They did this with multiple passengers, making a flight that was only half an hour delayed, delayed for over an hour. The staff were disorganized and mismanaged with people giving me different answers. I know they were just trying to do their jobs, but taking me off the plane to put all my clothes on the floor in the airport after I’d already boarded was nonsense. American has never been my preferred airline and I obviously won’t spend my money with them again."
60,"Not Verified |  Dallas to Philadelphia. This airline is a solid -1 out of ten. Literally any other airline is better than this one, unless you want your flight getting delayed to the point of it's crew going illegal. We had to sit in the terminal for 10 hours because of delays and they had to delay the flight for another 15 minutes after that for ""log issues"" or something like that."
61," My New York to Phoenix flight did not have charging ports. On my way back to New York I was threatened by an American Airlines employee just before boarding the flight. She was so nasty and rude and I was threatened in front of other passengers and my child. My child was so scared, they allowed other passengers to put small items and their jackets in the overhead bins so that there was not enough room for the rest of us to put our carry-ons in. I was in a strange place with a young child and the employee told me that she would leave me behind and to top it off it was Christmas eve. I will never fly with American Airlines again. Rude and disrespectful, I was the last class number 9 to board and I was treated like last class. I am a military mom coming back from visiting my son. American Airlines employees have no people skills, and on a 5-hour flight, all they give you is stale pretzels. I have never been shown so much disrespect and I have never been threatened in my life by anyone. I always follow the rules and many times I have been on an airplane and I have never encountered something like this."
62,"Not Verified | New York to Paris. My American Airline's flight has been completely awful up to this point and it hasn't been a few hours into our flight. Leading with boarding issues originating from delays. Which was reasonable in light of the fact that it had to do with the weather yet when I asked one of the workers posing a basic question about what time until are next flight which they answered with ""I don't know"" and returned to what they were doing. After at long last getting onto the plane I genuinely saw the absence of client assistance this spot advertised. Asking help with modifying my seat since it wasn't working and having them blow up and give me a grimy look was something totally uncalled for. There were more occasions that I've felt affronted on this flight yet I won't name everything. Despite the fact that I understand the weather is out their control I felt as though they indicated almost no consideration towards others. Never have I at any point felt so disrespected by a whole group and hence I without a doubt will not be flying American Airlines until the end of time."
63,"Not Verified | Dallas to Des Moines. I arrived in Dallas at 12pm my flight to Des Moines was suppose to depart at 3:20pm, at 2:59pm they tell us are gate is switched, we go to that gate and then tell us we are departing at 4:21pm. Then they make us switch gates again and don’t board until 4:30pm. We finally get to board and then someone puts the wrong fuel into our plan so we have to wait for them to empty out the fuel and put new fuel in. Then they say we are good to go, right when we start moving than they say that something is wrong with the door and we have to wait for someone to come fix the door. This is definitely the worst airline I have ever flown on and it is very very annoying for this. I would never and I mean never recommend American Airlines to anyone. Horrible airline. They seriously need to step it up and give refunds out or close down. I have been at an airport all day is this stuff does not help. I understand mistakes happen but this is not acceptable at all."
64,"  Orlando to Chicago via Fort Wayne. 2 cancelled flights due to weather. Next flight was not until 30 hours after original flight. I had to fly to a different city, Uber to my house then drive up to my family for Christmas the next morning. American Airlines offered no compensation for these expenses. I understand that weather is out of their control; however, they just didn't seem to care."
65,"  Hong Kong to Dallas Fort Worth. This is Anerican Airlines longest route. The customer service is the worst, the attendants are not well dressed, no smile or eye. While serving, if we ask some thing they terribly look at us. These crews should have been put on some other airlines as a passenger. If I get other options for my travel, I will never book American .. the worst, the worst. "
66,"Not Verified |  Miami to London. I am executive platinum and would not become loyal to American Airlines. First their upgrade list is horrible because even if you have free upgrades it’s based on your miles and not your frequent flyer miles your how far you fly miles which always puts me in economy. There planes are good the staff is good and the food is good (for plane food). So, I wouldn’t be loyal but I would fly them."
67,"Not Verified |  Dallas to Milan via Miami. Flight itself was not bad, however they did not even load up our bags on a two hour layover. Presently, no one will tell us how to get reimbursed for all our business clothes we had to buy in Milan and no idea when that reimbursement may come or to what extent. No question this is by far the worst airline in the world, and because they have all the gates there is no business way of making them any better. Additionally, all of the other airlines in the one world alliance have gotten worse because of the relationship. I’ve been trying to avoid them but it’s next to impossible if you have a tight schedule."
68,"  Los Angeles to London. When I arrived at the check in counter in Los Angeles I told the American Airlines employee that my flight was about to start boarding and I needed to check in immediately and the automated kiosk had not worked for me. The employee directed me out line for “main customer service” to a priority automated kiosk and told me to go to that counter if it didn’t work. I proceeded to do as I was told by the employee. After the automated machine still didn’t work I went to the priority counter which directed me to the counter next to them, who when I got to that counter directed me to the original counter I was in line with. When I got to the front of that line I was told I was no longer able to check in due to time being too close to the take off time by 5 minutes. I was deceived by multiple American Airlines employees who sent me to multiple counters and forced me to miss my flight by giving me false information. I had to book a completely different flight the following day to get to my destination. Multiple employees hindered my ability to get to my flight and were extremely unprofessional during the entire process."
69,"  Cancun to Philadelphia. A few months ago I flew AA business and I was hoping to get the same positive experience on this flight but that was not the case. Flying on this aircraft was a novelty experience and that is why I booked it. AA will be retiring the Boeing 767 soon. The business cabin was comfortable and the single window seat was great. AA just keeps getting service wrong. The pre-flight beverage was a plastic cup of water. First time on business I’m not asked what I wanted to drink pre flight. Once up in the air, snack and food was all served immediately. I went for the chicken option and it was ok. The business cabin only had 6 passengers and that included me, however the crew was just going thru the motions and although the job was done there was no interaction whatsoever. Long faces and no eye contact or follow up after service for the entire 4hr flight. WIFI only worked towards the end of the flight, we had the old school screens attached to the ceiling and no headphones where offered. A very poor business class experience on such an iconic aircraft. AA you need to get it together. Very sad flight coming home for Christmas."
70,"  On both our departing flights leaving Sioux Falls, SD and Dallas Tx we were delayed 2 hours. On the flight from Sioux Falls to Dallas I was unable to sit in the seat assigned to me which was by my husband as it was broken. Also we had requested wheel chair assistance and in Sioux Falls had no one help us. We did have someone help us in Dallas only after we had gotten half way through security."
71,"  Destin/Fort Walton to San Antonio via Dallas Ft Worth. What an overall terrible airline. My wife and I each fly probably 10 or more times a year on average for work and vacation and we try to avoid American Airlines like it’s a plague. At least 8 out of 10 times we have flown American, our flights have been delayed or cancelled, or they schedule very short layovers and their delays cause you to miss your connection. This morning they just cancelled our connecting flight. Then, as usual, blamed it on weather (othere’s not a cloud in the sky at either airport). Then the delays and cancelations force you to deal with their terrible customer service, I will not even get in to that, it’s a whole other review on its own, and there are plenty out there already. Bottom line, if this company wasn’t a borderline monopoly then they’d be on their way out of business already. Unfortunately there sometimes isn’t another choice, but if you can help it, fly another airline."
72,"  Rochester to Las Vegas via Charlotte. The worst airline I have ever flown. All legs of my flight were delayed. Ended up missing a connection. On the return flight, we sat on the runway for over an hour with maintenance issues. Unable to connect to Wifi during any flights. Also, no electric outlets on any of the flights. The Stewardess was quite rude to me personally. One star rating given because I can not give a lower rating,"
73,"Not Verified |  I had nothing but problems with American Airlines. We went to Miami in November. While there, we purchased new luggage. When we got home, one of the new pieces had one of the wheels  broken off. We went to baggage claims and they told us they would start a claim but did not think this one could be fixed. She was very nice and offered a replacement bag for us to get our stuff home in one piece and suggested we call when we get home. We did and at first, they told us we accepted a replacement piece so that closed the case. The brand new piece we purchased was almost $400 and they replaced it with a piece you could get on Amazon for $69. I told them this was unacceptable. She said she would have to speak with a supervisor and would get back to us the next day. I never heard back from them. So after a week, I called them back. Was told the person handling my claim was not there but took a message and said she would call back when she was in at work the next day. Again, no return phone call. I waited another week and still no call from them. I finally called them back and spoke to someone else. He also told me that I had accepted a new bag and the case was closed. I explained everything again and said that was unacceptable. He said he would talk with a manager and call me back. No return call. I called him back after a day or two and he said the manager agreed to pay for a replacement bag and he was sending me an email. In the email, it said I needed to send them a copy of the receipt. I did that right after I read their email. A few days later, I got another email saying they were sending me a check for the $389 replacement cost but had to return the bag they gave me to the airport. I drove an hour and forty minutes one way to return the bag they gave me. It took almost an hour to convince the people at the airport to accept the replacement bag back. I then had to call them again to ensure the system showed I returned it. A day later later I called again and they just sent me an email saying they were sending a check. I called again and asked why it was only for the $389 and not for the set they destroyed and what about the tax I paid. He said they do not reimburse for those things and the case was closed. I must say, if this is the way they treat customers who try to be brand loyal, I am just going to fly with whom ever is cheapest from here on out! If my loyalty means nothing to them, then I wont give it to them. I even offered to accept flight credit or even points at the beginning to make it easier on them. "
74," 
1.5 hr delay Chattanooga to Dallas. 11 hr delay Dallas to Amarillo. This is my first and probably last flight with American Airlines. Just hope I don't have the same problem going back. Plane was supposed to leave Dallas at 12.02 am but postponed til 10.53 am. Only compensation was a $12 meal voucher for the 11 hour layover."
75,"Not Verified |  Clearwater to Mexico City via Miami. This airline is awful. We bought tickets I expect to get on the plane with no issues but we didn't, our tickets were standby. We booked to go to Mexico City at 20th December and were still in the airport looking if there's room on the plane so we can get on."
76,"  Philadelphia to Zurich. This transatlantic flight was terrible! The interior of the aircraft was old, seats were uncomfortable and barely reclined. There was no in-seat entertainment system, they broadcast 3 'motion pictures' but none of which I could watch because the audio wasn't working at our seats 33A and 33B. Our reading light and attendant button also didn't work either. Nowhere to charge devices, relied on the airline to provide this and expectations were not met, it's 2019 and nearing 2020 and we couldn't find a USB port at our seats, even public buses have these. No entertainment, no comfort for a long-haul flight. Just a terrible  transatlantic flight, we paid so much money for such an awful experience. Disappointed, dissatisfied and will not be recommending this flight to family and friends. Don't want them to experience the same issues."
77, Sioux City to Chicago. Everything was going along well until 5 minutes before boarding. They announced a maintenance issue and kept pushing back departures until 8 hours delay. We missed an international flight and needed to book expensive tickets during winter holidays. There was no assistance or apology from AA.
78,"  Philadelphia to Atlanta. I arrived at this unorganized airport 2 hours early to my surprise flight # 1866 gate C19 while sitting there I hear one of the staff say I need everyone to go to gate B16. She was very rude and seemed to have an attitude. There were quite a few elderly people which none were offered assistance by wheelchair or any thing else. After walking this long distance. We started sitting down and I hear a gentleman say pardon the inconvenience we need every one to go to gate C24 following announcements on the loud speaker. I stopped an AA staff person to ask for wheelchair assistance for this elderly women and was told I have to find a porter! Now we start heading to the next gate which another announcement was made about the delay plane now being cleaned and will be heading over to the gate. We sat there about 10 to 15 mins enough time to finish my bagel and coffee. The next announcement made flight # 1866 will be departing from gate C29, this walk was not that bad, just an inconvenience especially to the elderly. We are now sitting there when the 2 female employees start calling up stand bys after stand bys Then they finally start calling group #’s up which I noticed stand by customers are boarding before me and allowed to take there rolling bags and carrying on bags. I was confused the entire time but would not express that to the staff. Then the employees now called up groups 7 -9 to check there rolling luggage in before boarding the plane. A women in front of me started to board the plane with her rolling bag and they got very nasty with her and called security. Then the female employee who was checking in bags said didn’t I announce this when I said 7-9 with carry on bags only can board the plane and rolling bags have to be checked in. I was upset due to all the gate changing, booking this unprofessional flight and now have to check my bag in after down sizing my bag in the first place, so my daughter and 1 month old grandson who I am meeting for the first time, would not have such a long wait for me! I question America Airlines unprofessionalism, the lack of empathy for the elderly and the lack of customer service from the check in staff! I will not be flying with AA anymore or booking through cheapoair anymore. These flights and all the fees attached are far too expensive to have this sort of experience. I will say going through security was the only great experience ! The TSA agents were great! But the overall experience earned from me is a 1. I will also be calling American Airlines to put in a verbal complaint and advising them to have more training with there staff. "
79," Pittsburgh to Orange County via Dallas. This is for the front desk for American Airlines at the Pittsburg Airport. The staff working was extremely rude. We finished our work meeting very early. About three hours early to be exact. I approached the check-in counter and kindly said hello. No response from this older woman. I said, ""Hi, I was wondering if there are any earlier flights to Santa Ana Orange County.” She just says, ""I have no idea who you are. Give me your idea"". No enthusiasm, super rude. The whole conversation was like this. She told me I’m flying out of Pittsburg at 5:22PM (Obviously, I know this as it’s on my boarding pass). I asked again, “Yes, I’m trying to see if there’s an early flight to out. She just says, ”No” and prints my boarding pass. Super rude seems like she hates her job, not friendly at all. Everything else about the trip with American Airlines was great until this unpleasant woman entered the picture."
80,"  Los Angeles to Phoenix. We were forced to check our bags at the gate due to “limited space”. We sat on the plane for 1.5 hours to be told that we need to get off and rebook since the “maintenance issues” really weren’t resolved. This was after a 1.5 hour delay on that same flight. Why put us on a plane you can’t certify???? We did manage to get the last two seats to come home to Phoenix. We’re back packers in Southeast Asia. Small back packs. Since we were forced to check our packs, we waited at baggage claim to find out that my husbands GoPro camera and Apple Watch were stolen from the bag. Do not agree to check your bags. There was more than enough space in the bins. And when we go to file a claim at phoenix sky harbor, we have a new person that was too lazy to help and another useless employee that “assisted” in handing us a paper form and saying “fill this out and good night”. So disappointed.  We can’t get back the memories that are lost. Have fun with our stolen property."
81,"Not Verified |  What an awful airline. I will never be using them again. I had my flight delay 5 times due to ""airplane maintenance"" and then was stuck in Charlotte for the night. I then finally got to Tri cities today just to find out that mine and my girlfriends bags were both ripped and my game console was broken. Clearly American Airlines is just awful everywhere, be it TN or NH. There are much better airlines. Spare yourself a horror story like this."
82, Detroit to Dallas. They suck in every way. Service suck. Policies suck. Prices suck. Never fly American Airlines. I have been sitting here delayed traped on a cramped airplane for 45 minutes. They just keep telling me lies about some bag they need to get. I just went to my grandpa's funeral and I have finals tomorrow. I am unbelievably upset. They can't even tell me the real reason we are going nowhere. I will never fly with American Airlines again. I wish I could give them a big fat 0!
83,Not Verified |  Charlotte to Las Vegas. I fly American frequently because they are so dominant in Charlotte but to be honest they suck. They have old airplanes. Overworked grouchy flight attendants and their frequent flyer program is misleading and a rip off. I took a flight to Thailand using a one world partner carrier in October and they won’t honor the miles I asked about before booking. They are horrible. If you have a choice book with someone else.
84,Not Verified |  Denver to Atlanta. I am elite status and booked a flight with for my daughter and they are charging her for a bag. I tried to talk with them but they refused to listen to my request. Both my daughter and I have the city advantage card which allows us a free bag. I am very frustrated this point and think it’s all a scam. So very disappointed in American Airlines. I can see why they are not one of the preferred carriers
85,"  Miami to New York. On numerous trips over the last five years all within the US, I have not really encountered any major issues. If you hold a ticket, not on standby and understand that within the US the service is perfunctory and you have to buy F & B on board then all is fine. The run from Miami to NY was quick. Just a bit over 2 hours and totally uneventful. One time at both ends. Newish aircraft and had come on with some snacks IFE and WiFi were both fine. So really nothing to complain about."
86,"  My initial flight was scheduled to depart at 1:40pm & arrive in Charlotte by 5:24pm with my connecting flight scheduled to leave at 6:20pm & arrive in GA at 7:40pm. My initial flight was delayed to a 2:15pm departure, then 2:30pm and it didn’t leave until 2:50pm. Due to all of the delays, I missed my 6:20pm connecting flight and booked another flight that was scheduled to depart at 8:20pm. We boarded on time and were set to go when it’s announced that there’s a worn out tire on the plane & we won’t be departing until around 9:15pm. This was the longest & most frustrating travel day ever .. not sure what caused the initial delay but I’ll be thinking twice before traveling with American Airlines again."
87,"Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Oklahoma City. Me, my wife, and five month old son were flying home For Christmas and our baby (as expected for a newborn) was extra fussy on a late night flight. Our flight attendant Ester went out of her way to move us to a new row with more room, help to take care of him, and just sit and talk to us about our lives. She made us so comfortable, and made a point to remember our names. We are forever grateful for helping make our first family holiday season so wonderful, and would love to thank her again and again personally. "
88,  Lexington to Washington via Charlotte. This airline managed to misplace my suitcase and placed it on the wrong flight. So I got to my destination and it was nowhere to be found. They found the flight it was placed on and offered to drop it off to my home for free. The next day they drop it off with a broken zipper and tell me I've got 24 hrs to bring it back if I want it fixed or replaced. I'm an hour away from this airport. I would not recommend this airline unless you're on a very tight budget. They're not worth your time.
89,"Not Verified |  On my way from Miami to Sacramento I needed to catch a flight to Sacramento. There was little time,25 minutes between arriving in Dallas and leaving. Just prior to boarding the plane I informed the attendant that I had left my MacbookAir on my Miami flight. Instead of having someone call the gate and have them check for Mac she said to go online and report missing. It has now been over a week and my Mac has not showed up. How hard would it have been to take a few minutes to try to help me find prior to being lost?"
90,"Not Verified |  I called the 1800 number to make sure our puppies could go on their flights with their new owners. Everything went well and was approved by them. When we got to the airport that wasn't the case. American Airlines did not let the puppy go home with it's owner. I understand that the pet policy is strict, but for them to deny a puppy that can stand up, turn around, sit down, lay down comfortably is not okay. Dog breeders want their puppies safe, safer than the policies of what airlines approve to be safe. The in cabin pet policy needs to be looked at and fixed. I will make sure no one else books a flight through American Airlines for taking a puppy home from us. This was the biggest waste of time, stressful on the new dog owner, myself, and most of all the puppy."
91," I was on work travel from the US to Spain and brought my husband and 18-month old baby with me. We had bought separate tickets on 2 consecutive days, but mine ended up being economy and my husband + baby, premium economy. Both for basically the same price for the round-trip flights ($1348.83 for economy vs $1366.16 for premium economy). When we boarded, the economy class was packed, not a seat open. However, the premium economy was practically empty, only 5 other passengers. The seat next to my husband (baby was a lap infant) was open, because the woman assigned to it quickly changed to a different seat (nodbody wants to sit next to a baby, right?). So as the seat became open, I went and sat there, and immediately the flight attendant went to get a supervisor to scold me. The two woman ganged up on me and yelled at me, accusing me of having kicked out the other lady from her seat. I thought, what are these lies? They very meanly told me to go sit at my regular seat, 20 rows back. I obeyed, but after reaching 10000 ft of altitude I communicated my situtation to another flight attendant, to see if they could understand that I am a mother who has been separated from her baby and husband. They were very mean. They again yelled at me saying that you have to pay for that class, $500 or $800 (two people told me 2 different things). How ironic that the prices we paid for these two different classes were the same! Also, I bet that, had I been their ""friend"" or sister, the treatment would have been different. So then my husband called the manager, and very politely conveyed our situation and asked why couldn't I be with them, if there were tons of open seats available. He first said “I hear that you’ve had an encounter with all my staff”. Ok, first off, “an encounter?” Asking questions is “an encounter”?! Second, aren't the staff there to help customers? Doesn’t American Airlines always say that they are there to serve you and make your flight great? Then he said that it was the regulation, but yet, he was willing to break the regulations by letting me take my baby with me to my seat, even though he was *not* the lap infant associated with my ticket. Oh, so we break one rule, the one about swapping seats and tickets for the child, but not the rule about moving ""up"" on a seating class (barely, still economy)? While this was happening, the seat belt sign was off, so I had left my seat to go see my family. The meal time also began. The two flight attendants who had previously yelled at me in a 2-against-1 scenario, now attacked me again. ""Go back to your seat!"" ""You can't be here!"". I was just visiting my family, and all of my stuff was in our shared carry-on which my husband had! They boxed me in between two carts, they made me cry. Other passengers saw all of this and invited me to come over to their seat, so that the carts could move (since the flight attendants weren't being cooperative). People who I had never seen before in my life were very sympathetic. Some later approached me and said ""they were really out to get you"". It was a clear situation of abuse of power by American Airlines, and a lack of heart towards families with young children."
92,Not Verified |  Baton Rouge to Newark via Charlotte. 10 legs over 2 separate days on business trip and only 2 on time. The on time flight included the flight attendant dumping water all over my carry on during service. I don’t see how this airline stays profitable. Just terrible and American Airlines won’t get my business again.
93, Wichita to Dallas with American Airlines. Minor passenger issue that incompetent airline employees could not handle. Flight delayed well over an hour and connecting flight missed. Typical Airline incompetance!
94," American Airlines put me in the worst possible situation and didn't blink an eye. Long story short I was checked in via my email since the day prior to the flight, I was at the airport 2 hours early for my flight hanging out outside so I could smoke, when I went to go through security 45 min prior to my flight. I had missed my check in time is what I was told and can't get a flight until tommorow as a ""standby"". Between just getting out of the marine corps and starting a new job weeks ago, having 2 kids the holidays and va appointments this was devastating to me and sw customer service treated it as if they were annoyed by me and needed to help the next customer. I will never fly American Airlines again. I managed to work a ticket getting within 2 hours of my destination through SW Airlines landing tonight but now I have to find a way to get home from there with little money. Thanks American Airlines."
95,Not Verified |  Prior to taking off plane had engine problems. One person to reroute the whole plane. Spent 5 more hours and an extra lay over before reaching my destination. All after plans needed to be cancelled. Customer service contact and show no accountability for ruining our overnight trip to NYC. Refused to give another ticket for our troubles or acknowledge their part. They felt a $100.00 certificate could make up for the it faulty equipment and our time. No compassion from the customer service representative. I will never fly with them or affiliates again.
96,  Miami to Hartford. I’ve been flying 3-5 times per year for over 17 yrs and American Airlines is by far the worst airline I’ve flown. If you buy economy tickets with your significant other they can sit you in row 5 and your wife in row 9. If you ask to be sat together because you have never had that issue with any other airline they will charge $56 to sit you together. Is almost like they go out of their way to make your experience as miserable as possible.
97,"  Madrid to San Francisco via Dallas Ft Worth. On 12/2/19, my 9 yo daughter was traveling from Madrid>DFW>SFO. I get a call at 11pm PST stating that she cannot check in due to the unaccompanied minor fee not being paid. When I booked this flight it was mandatory that both unaccompanied minor fees were paid for both ways. While on the phone with the agent she confirmed both ways were paid. Unfortunately when I was sent my trip confirmation unaccompanied minor doesn’t show up on that. After receiving the phone call I immediately called the airline to fix this problem and was told that somehow the system must have dropped the unaccompanied minor for the trip back. At that time I offered to pay this fee and was told that they could not take my payment over the phone! So here I have my 9yo daughter in Spain and I can’t pay for her to get here. I suggested that this fee be waived since this was American Airlines fault, the agent also mentioned that should could not do this as well.  Thank god a stranger ended up paying for her unaccompanied minor fee at the gate in Spain. If this very generous person didn’t take care of this my child would be stuck alone in a foreign country.  My daughter gets to DFW at 1:35PM. Her next flight is scheduled to leave DFW at 4:49. After 13 delays the new time to depart is 11:05PM. 10 hours she is sitting in the airport and during this time she was not in the unaccompanied minor room, they had her sitting in the gate area alone. I had called the gate multiple times to make sure she was ok and that someone there had fed her. I was told she was fed a cookie, chips and some soda, she was NOT fed a hot meal. I then asked where she was and was told she was asleep in a chair next to the gate! My 9yo was left in the main area and not in the unaccompanied minor room where she should have been. At this point I finally get a hold of a manager who apologized for everything and took my daughter to get a hot meal and back to the UM room. (7 hours too late). In addition my daughter was mingling with people at the gate and even ate with some random family. Coco was the only amazing thing about this trip home for my daughter. No one called me to update me, no one tried to get this 9yo on another flight to another nearby airport. I looked up the other flights and plenty went out before flight 2393 I am beyond livid . Where in American Airlines mind is any of this ok. You put my child in great danger. I will never fly your airline again and will make sure others are aware of the horrible customer service with your airlines. I did receive a voucher for the UM service, however I would like a full refund."
98, Chicago to Cancun. Do not fly American Airlines. Second time in a row my baggage didn’t make it to my destination. They promised me it would be delivered within 24 hrs and here I am 24 hrs later with no bag and no update from them. Tried calling and representative didn’t speak English. Ruined my vacation.
99,"Not Verified |  Newark to Peoria via Chicago. Delayed out of Newark (due to weather, understandable). While boarding we were told the over head bins were full and our carry-ons now HAD to be checked. But could not be answered and confirmed as to what would happen to our suitcases if we missed our connection or switched flights. Once on board we noticed the back half the plane was hardly full and there was plenty of space for our bags. Once arrived in O'Hare we had time to make our connection. We were not allowed to deplane for over 25 mins. We ran across the terminal, once arrived at the gate of our flight home we were told the plane left, we missed it. We were sent down to customer service, there we were told our flight was gone and offered to be placed on a flight to Bloomington (55 mins away from where we live) or we had to wait until the next day to be sent to Peoria. We triple checked with the man that our luggage would be sent with us on our plane. He said he put a note confirming our bags would follow, if not file a claim. While boarding for the Bloomington flight, I received text alerts informing me my original flight home has been delayed and new departure time is at 10 pm. So our flight was still in Chicago and we were being sent to a different city for NO REASON! Top it off, once we arrived in Bloomington only 1 of 3 bags made it and of course NO ONE working can be found anywhere to make a claim. We track down a luggage worker and they search the numbers, our bags were sent to the Peoria flight scheduled for the next day! Not only did we have to schedule a different ride to take us home 1 hr at midnight, when our flight home that we ""missed"" arrived in Peoria at 11pm. Now we have to take off work the next day to go pick up our luggage from the Peoria airport because they sent it to the wrong flight! Worst part, throughout this process we couldn't find anyone to help us and if we did they didn't/ couldn't give us actual answers! Would not recommend American Airlines!"
100,"  San Antonio to San Juan via Miami. Date of return flight on American Airlines 11/14/19, our flight was canceled which caused me to miss a court hearing resulting in us having to pay additional to our attorney. Our first night in our hotel we had no water or ac and were told to us the restroom in the restaurant. We will never use Expedia or American Airlines ever again!"
101," Philadelphia to Denver. My husband and I were returning from Italy and had a 6 hr layover in Philadelphia. When we boarded the plane at 1900 our flight was delayed for 2 hours. The pilot told us to get off and we would board again about 1/2 hour. I noticed a large line forming in front of customer service and noticed an email informing me our flight had been cancelled. My husband got in line. I got on the phone to try to get us tickets. After 45 min on hold, I reached a representative. She could not find a departing flight available from Philadelphia for days but told me if we could get to Baltimore by 6am there was a flight leaving at 8 am. We agreed and just as she was getting our information the call was interrupted by an automated message asking if I would work with that representative again. I was then thanked and the call was ended without tickets. I called AA again while I was in line and in 45 min I was on the line again with a representative. I explained that my husband had gotten frustrated with what had become over a two-hour wait to get a flight home and had purchased a returning flight through Delta Airlines the next morning. I asked her if she could book us on a different airline and she said that there were no flights available. I asked her if we should cancel the flights that we have booked through Delta so that she could book those flights through Delta for us and she said there was no way that she could guarantee that she could get those tickets if we canceled them and that we should just keep those tickets and get a refund on those Delta tickets from AA. I asked her if she could get us a hotel. She said there was really nothing else she could do. As we were exiting the terminal to get our checked bags visiting with some of the other passengers we were told that they were given hotel vouchers for a nearby hotel. We decided to return to the customer service people and see if we could get a room as well but no one was there. When we returned to Denver I contacted customer service who told me that I needed to reach out to refunds. Refunds told me that since I had booked my flight through Iberia and my husband had booked his flight through British Airways that we would need to contact them. My husband and I contacted above-mentioned airways who emailed us back denying any responsibility and putting the responsibility back on American Airlines. I contacted American Airlines again and they said that we should contact cheap o air where we had originally booked the flights. We contacted cheapo air and they denied any responsibility as it was American Airlines problem. I reached out to refunds again and was told that I needed to contact customer service. I contacted customer service and spoke with a woman who said that she would get this resolved and contact us within two days. She never returned our call and I could not reach her with just her first name when I called back. I was told again that I had contacted the wrong department and that I needed to reach out to refunds. I probably have close to 30 hours into trying to resolve this problem. I am not quite sure where to turn at this point. It is highly unlikely that I will ever choose to fly on American Airlines again."
102,"Not Verified |  Buffalo to Cancun via Philadelphia. After being almost a 2hr delay, with absolutely not weather events and the 35mins circling the sky to land in Philadelphia. My wife and I have upgraded seats. Had 5mins to get through customs and heard the flight to Buffalo, NY was about to close the gates. After running with my military service connected knee and back conditions. And after asking for a ride by an attendant, which we were denied, made to the gate on time. However, the airlines sold our seats to someone else, even though we made it on time. The ticket agents need to have a bit of customer service training. They could not have been more ignorant, especially when I attempted to get it straightened out. I was given a the neck jerk and the hand, while she took our tickets and would give me their names. So, now I am stuck in a hotel when I should be home already. Not only that, the Homeland Security act has given these folks the audacity the act like law enforcement officers. I worked for custom and immigrations for many yrs and have never experienced the ignorant folks you have working for you. I will never fly with American Airlines again."
103,"  Los Angeles to Boston via Philadelphia. Extremely disappointed, mainly by the crew. When we were first at the gate, the gate agent made us put our bags in the bag sizer to check if they fit, which was fine. However we had 2 of the same exact suitcase, one of which had a backpack and jacket on top. We briefly explained that it was the same suitcase and it would be too much of a hassle to put it in the bag sizer and began to leave. As we were walking down the jet bridge, she was saying ""It won't fit. When we got on the plane, the greeter kept saying 'good morning' to everyone, despite it being 11pm. While passengers were trying to sleep (because it was a redeye) crew were talking about their life and other nonsense. When I confronted them about this, they rudely stated 'We're working'. They did not bring drinks when passengers woke up, which would have been nice on a 5 hr flight. Only tolerable part was the legroom. No adjustable headrest, though."
104,"  My 2nd ever worst flight in business class was Miami to Santo Domingo AA987. After a overnight stay in Miami I skipped breakfast at the hotel to get something light in the lounge. I was pointed to the AA lounge by gate D15. But not much there to eat but some fruit and yoghurt. The rest they wanted me to pay for. Well ok I thought I’ll get breakfast on board. (Afterwards I was informed by BA staff I should have gone to the lounge by D30 apparently) To my surprised, all that was served as breakfast on board was yoghurt and fruit or a bagel. Business class - no way!"
105,"  Santo Domingo to Miami. My worst ever business class flight was the AA1154. Got up and left the hotel at 4:15am. Arrived at the airport and checked in. NO lounge! Had to sit at the gate for over 1 hr. Finally on the plane. About 1 hr after take-off the cabin crew asked if I wanted breakfast. My question was what were the choices. Surprise me! 1 decilitre of yoghurt and 17 grams of granola. With a small power bar. I even had better breakfasts on domestic flights in Sweden. And thank you BA, Qatar Airways and others to serve decent breakfasts, lunches and dinners! And snacks in between. Both in first and businesses class. AA answer ""we are sorry for your bad experience"". Nothing else! No compensation or anything! Never American Airlines again!"
106,"  Boston to Dallas Ft Worth, first I find that they do not give veterans any type of benefits, not even a free checking bag. Than they gave me the wrong gate number, almost missed the flight. The staff were incredibly.  I dont see why a retired veteran can't get any benefits."
107," New York to Miami. I had the most ridiculous excuse given to me to justify me not being given a seat on my flight I was on time for. I arrived at 2:30 for a 3:30 flight, after ten minutes in the kiosk and another 10 of an attendant helping me, I was informed that I would not be allowed onto my flight as I was too late. After receiving my standby flight ticket to a later flight and a quick security check, I arrived at my terminal by 3:05 and was still not allowed onto my flight. I spent the next three hours waiting for my new flight for absolutely no reason. They told me if I had checked in beforehand I wouldn’t have lost my seat but the email confirmation had no check in for someone who didn’t pay extra to reserve a seat."
108,  Charlotte to Atlanta. Very unimpressed with customer service. I was connecting through Charlotte and saw an earlier flight back to Atlanta available than the one i was on (both american flights). I went to the terminal and they very rudely told me i could not switch flights. I went and checked snd there was 15 seats available on the flight. I went back to discuss with them and offered to pay a transfer fee and they still would not allow it. You would think with how competitive flight industry us that something as simple as switching to an earlier flight where there was plenty of excess seating would be doable. I do not plan to be flying American again.
109,"  They cancelled my flight due to lack of staff and logistical error. We sat on the runway for over 90min. The pilot even voiced his frustration over the PA system. I shared detailed information with the airline about how I lost wages and wanted some form of restitution. They decided to claim it was ""weather related"" which was a flat out lie. Very unprofessional.  Won't fly with them again."
110,"  This was the worst flying experience I’ve ever had. I understand bad weather happens, but the way this airline handled their problem was unacceptable and offensive to me and likely all the others that AA stuck with the bills that were “complimentary”. I was in NYC getting 2nd opinions on recurrent stage 4 cancer. The weather got bad on my way back home and our plane never left runway. We were all bussed back to the airport and shoves in a small room as they tried to figure out alternate routes. It was disappointing they couldn’t get me home until 11pm the following night due to both NYC airports shutting down so it was a mess. The nice man at the rebooking booth knew it was way too long for someone in my condition to wait it out in an airport as it would be almost 24 hours. He offered me a food credit, 2 shuttle credits, and 2 nights at a hotel he told me was within 2 miles if LaGuardia. Food credit worked great and I got food before I left for the shuttle. I then waited outside in the pouring rain as the shuttle just wasn’t coming even after an hour. Finally I see it and make sure to get on first. It was at that time the driver asked to see the credit and he said okay hop in. Let’s get you to the Bronx! The Bronx I said? It’s true they booked all of use in the hurtle in a Comfort Inn in the Bronx much further than 2 miles. I was just happy to be going to a room as I was beginning to feel weak and tired. I hopped off the bus first and ran in when we got there. This was pure intuition. I walk in and explain and show my vouchers only to be told they don’t take airline vouchers as the rest of the entire shuttle lines up behind me. She called 3 managers on speaker phone and they all said they don’t take them Nor were they notified by American Airlines. So it’s storming and this lobby is full of upset people. They were about to get more upset when the woman tells us all they only have 3 rooms total available for everyone and you must pay for it. I paid for that night and the next day since they refused to take my two vouchers and the next day as my flight was 10pm. It was $175 a night. The next day they end up changing my flight twice so I could longer use my voucher for the shuttle as they didn’t allow me enough time with the last second flight change to sooner take off. Now I had to pay $43 for an uber ride to the airport because they moved the flight back up last second to try and get out before a storm. I did all of this as I had no help and no choice. I explained all of this in detail with proof and there must have been others report this as we had a full large shuttle with people that got no room at all. I provided receipts. They can verify it all. I spent nearly $400 all because of them. They refused to refund anything for months and then send a $143.00 check which I still am unsure where that number came from. I called and they told me to go to the airport as thats the only way to be refunded. I did this and they said no refunds are processed at the airport and to go home and email them. I did that too. Nothing. Very sad for such a large accomplished airline. It’s sad because I fly them often and use an associated credit card. I will never fly them again unless necessary. Regardless, they need to redo their customer service when it comes to the example above. Bad bad! If I wanted to pay I would’ve stayed closer to the airport..."
111,  Charlotte to Dallas Ft Worth. Zero accountability and the staff could not care for the inconvenience of scores of passengers and they did as little as possible to accommodate all of us. I knew they were terrible already and should have avoided flying with them. Their mistake cost us a lot of extra time and even more expenses. They simply provide poor services and seem fine with that
112,"  Houston to Cleveland via Dallas. Flight was delayed, wait for technical 1 hour resolve a problem, then could not landed at first time. Just came one minute late at connection gate but was too late - how it possible the same company could not track if another AA flight coming little bit late, passengers losing time and money and have to wait 5 more hours for next flight. Poor customer service."
113,"  Kansas City to Ft Lauderdale via Dallas. I am so disgusted with American Airlines. We booked our tickets in September for a cruise in December. In November, they sent us a notice they changed the times and our 1.5-hour delay was now to be 45 minutes. Then on the way to the airport, they delayed it 40 more minutes making our connection impossible. We waited in line for a long time, because anyone with priority or 1st class gets a special line and goes immediately ahead of all regular passengers. The ticket agent insisted we take another flight leaving in 40 minutes - we barely made it to the gate. Then they announced that this flight was now delayed so we were going to once again miss our connection. They would not allow me to take my carry-on onto the plane - even though other bags were bigger because mine was an actual carry-on. Hint: shopping bags, duffle bags and backpacks all bugger were allowed. Knowing that I was going to be stuck in Dallas because there was no way to make connections. I needed my bags. They gave me a garbage bag for the items I needed which was all but a tiny bit. Bags are allowed. One the plane waiting it was in the mid to high 80's and we sat there for 20 minutes and counting as of right now."
114,"Not Verified |  Me and my family book the flight from Boston to Montego Bay in Jamaica for a family vacation. We book through Apple vacations, booked our seats they were reserved so all our receipts were together after we received our confirmation we noticed that the flight to Montego Bay our seats were not together. We called Apple vacations and were informed that it was an error on American Airlines so I called and spoke to the representative at American Airlines and was told there was nothing I could do unless I paid an additional $200 Plus the cost of the seats which was approximately $37 a seat. I asked to speak to a manager  who told me there was nothing he could do because we booked through a third-party and we would have to pay the fees associated with switching seats. When I try to explain the fact that I could not have a six-year-old and 11-year-old sitting by them self multiple rows apart it made no difference. He kept saying you need to pay the money so you can sit with your family even though there was multiple seats available there was nothing he could do. This is poor customer service. Who would put their kids with strangers, when you’re on a plane people want you to take care of your children especially a six-year-old."
115,"Not Verified |  Indianapolis to Syracuse. This is the worst airline I have ever flown . Completely unreliable and unorganized. I was suppose to arrive in Syracuse By 2 pm by a connecting flight in Washington DC. Then my flight out of Indianapolis was delayed an hour and then they finally told us a piece of the plane had to be replaced and we wouldn’t take off until 12:10. It took them an entire hour and half to tell us this information. Now I’m on 2 connecting flights to Philly, Boston, then finally Syracuse where I land at 8:30 pm. I have 2 three hour layovers at my connecting flights. It’s my birthday and I was suppose to return to campus today to hang out with my friends. Now my day is wasted and my birthday is ruined. If you ever have the option to pay more for another airline do it, American Airlines is not worth your time. Also the seats are the worst."
116,"Not Verified |  We cancelled a ""non-refundable"" ticket a month and a half before our scheduled departure. We booked and paid for our flights in October 2019; We were on a budget but still wanted to take a vacation out to see a good friend in California. I had been mulling over different flights and came across one with AA which fit within our budget. The flight out had a 10 hour layover in Phoenix, and an hour layover on the way home. This was fine with us since I have another good friend who lives in Phoenix, so staying with him for a few hours seemed logical for a cheap flight (our total all together with upgraded seats was about $780 for both tickets). A month went by and I get a simple email saying that there had been a change to our itinerary, but they didn't charge us any extra money. I go to look at our new flight schedules and AA had the nerve to double our layover time to 20 hours in Phoenix and add another layover on the way home in Charlotte, with 20 minutes between landing and takeoff to change planes in Charlotte. This makes two layovers now on the trip home. All the changes meant we were literally traveling for a total of 30 hours all together (for a flight that is barely 6 hours nonstop). We had previously booked and paid for lodging in Oakland for our flight in, and with the new itinerary change we would have been forced to cancel. I was finally fed up and called AA, who was very pleasant on the phone and they couldn't believe how drastically our schedule was changed and assured a full refund (which I have received). We re-booked with Southwest, nonstop both ways for less than $150 more. Well worth the extra money in my opinion."
117,"  Houston to Dallas. Absolutely awful, most unorganized, rude and disrespectful flight I’ve ever been on. No urgency or customer service whatsoever. Will never fly American Airlines again."
118,  Philadelphia to Indianapolis. Worst plane ever. They don’t have manners. They don’t provide food or earphones on a 4 hr long flight. They are very rude and unprofessional. Hate American Airlines.
119,"Not Verified |  London Heathrow to Chicago. When printing boarding pass for me and wife I had a security check, would not permit me to get a seat. When cleared security, a seat was assigned and had to sit separated from my wife for 8 hr flight. American made me feel like a criminal and was not a nice way to end vacation. Also flight attendant constantly ran beverage cart into my shoulder and never apologized or said anything, very rude. "
120,"Not Verified |  New York to London. Totally shocked how non existent of customer service from the security staff checking through your hand luggage to the cabin staff (not all of them) who were so rude, unfriendly, unhelpful, arrogant andjust down right miserable and obviously not enjoying their jobs?. Such a disappointing way to finish your holiday andsuch a incredible difference from British Airways on the way out? Awful food - when I was told one of the options was pasta - I asked ‘what was in with it and the answer was ""pasta"" - quite bluntly, they need lessons in manners! Will never fly with them ever again nor would I recommend them to anyone."
121,"  I had to book a last minute flight due to my sister's impending death. I was upset and didn't know how or when to schedule my return trip. I scheduled my return for a week later, for fear if I waited to schedule after my sister died and it being so close to Thanksgiving, that the ticket price would be inflated. I paid $663 for a round trip nonrefundable ticket. I couldn't return on the scheduled date, as my sister was still fighting to stay alive. I called AA and was told by a nice lady that they could help me. I gave her proof by providing the Hospice facility phone number. She said they would only charge me for the difference between my 1st ticket and a new return ticket. My sister passed away the next day. I called AA back and the man I spoke to was not pleasant at all. He didn't show any sympathy whatsoever. My original ticket was $663. He then told me my flight back was only worth $118 and my new ticket would be around $660 (a 1 way ticket!) so the difference left for me to pay would be around $550 to get back home. I didn't have that much money and I don't understand how they could say my first ticket, the return trip home, was worth so little. Needless to say, this was very upsetting, considering the grief I was already going through. Thank God, Spirit Airlines saved me with a much cheaper ticket to get me home. I will never fly with AA again."
122,Not Verified |  Seattle to Los Angeles. This is the worst airline ever. I had to check my bag in because there was not enough storage when in fact there is so much storage on this plane. We have been waiting at the gate to take off for an hour now. Everything about this airline sucks. I was supposed to be in LA by 1 but looks like I will be home by 3 pm. 
123,  Atlanta to Chicago. I have to write in for American Airlines my flight today was outstanding. This is Thanksgiving week and flight's are busy and over booked and full (no empty seats). I have flown many Airlines and must say I have had extremely good service to exceptional today the flight was smooth flight attendants did a great job today. I am not sure if they hear that enough and want you to know thank you I look forward to flights on American Airlines in the future.
124,"  LaGuardia to Miami via Aruba. After boarding plane were asked to get off stating fuel door issue. After the 2 hour delay we take off and miss our connecting flight in Miami by 15 minutes to Aruba where vacation is planned. We then book the flight for next morning and figure well stay in Miami for the day and overnight. We find out our luggage is getting held for next days flight or we can wait 2 to 8 hours in airport until they find it. Then, they give us a free night at the Miami airport hotel which was for lack of a better term, horrendous (rather than in our paid for hotel in Aruba). They were nice enough to give us food vouchers for $12 per person in total. Considering we had wait 20 hours this was the final slap in the face and didn't even cover breakfast. I understand problems, delays etc but the way they handle this situation is nothing but corporate greed and no regard for customer service."
125,  San Francisco to Barcelona via New York. My wife and I were bumped from premium economy to standard economy. The reason was they had over sold premium economy. Because this occurred halfway to our destination I felt trapped by this sudden change and had to accept the smaller seats or lose our prepaid lodging and tours in Barcelona. We originally choose premium economy because my wife has been reluctant to travel if she has to be confined in a small economy seat. It now looks like the airlines actions are going to limit my travel. What other businesses can get away with selling a product or service and then change it at the last minute solely for their benefit?
126,"  San Antonio to Houston. I will never fly this airline again. I was let through to the boarding gate, my carry on was fine until I was boarding. Then I was charged an extra fee for my bag. I was refused my purse with my medication. I was treated with complete disrespect and rudeness. Just because I was at the terminal and I was flying economy. I was treated like a second class citizen."
127,"Not Verified |  American Airlines is by far the worst airline I’ve ever travelled with. I flew with the to Milwaukee in August, through the 3 AA delayed flights, it took just shy of 24 hours! I could have travelled to Australia in this time. The ground staff are exceptionally condescending and hopelessly rude. The cabin crew and hopeless and rude. We missed our connecting flight as a result they put me in two further flights to try and get me there. They lost my luggage and one the way back a week later, more delayed coupled with rude arrogant staff. Even the customer service team are hopeless. After 12 emails they finally offered me $200, I’m yet to receive this and now it’s November. Avoid this airline at all costs"
128,"Not Verified | Dallas to Lubbock. This is the worst airline I've ever encountered. Flight was delayed 5 times! But there was another flight scheduled later going to the same destination as us and they left with no problems. But our flight was delayed by over 5 hours and they refused to tell us why. They were absolutely no help. I am appalled at the lack of customer service and professionalism. In all of my travelling, I have never had a flight delated that many times without being told anything. They even had us deplane and still refused to tell us what was up. Tried to ask if I needed to rent a car instead and she rolled her eyes at me and scoffed saying to do whatever I wanted then walked away. I was stunned! Fly with any other company. Hell even fly with Delta or whatever is the worst one and it will still be better than this."
129,Not Verified |  Miami to Oslo. American Airlines offer BA ticket on their website. If you purchase a BA ticket through American Airlines they will not honor your system wide upgrade or honor the same day flight change if the flight change is from BA to American Airlines. I have paid with real money and $$$ to earn my Executive platinum reward. I don't care how American Airlines deal with BA. If AA sells ticket to me then they have to honor what I have earned. Shame on you again.
130,"  Atlanta to Salisbury via Philadelphia. I will never fly them again and I know I'm not the only one from last night that feels the same way. My son gets motion sickness and while our flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia was extremely bumpy not to mention the aborted takeoff. We were late getting to Philadelphia which made us have to run from gate A to Gate F. Needless to say that did not help his motion sickness and when we sat down in the plane to go home to Salisbury MD he threw up. So rather than letting me clean it up they just decided to kick us off the plane, no explanation, no exceptions whatsoever. Absolute worst airline."
131,"  San Diego to Dallas. The worst experience ever. I checked my bag and the bag came back destroyed, ripped with my belongings out in a plastic bag. They offered a new bag which was too small and suggested to put the rest in plastic bags! I refused and I bought a new same size bag at the airport, same size as my old one. They refused to refund for a new bag saying that my bag was improperly packed (not true, never had that issue before and with other airline. and what even that means?). "
132," Flights are always delayed. They charge high dollar for garbage service. We pay $2200 to fly from Denver to Key West just to have the flight delayed we missed our connecting flight by a few minutes because they were delayed and even though the plane was still sitting in the runway with walk way attached they would not let us on. They don’t offer compensation or upgrades or anything for the hassle and wasted money. We also paid top dollar for a house on the beach that we’re no longer staying at. The flights they tried to give us due to the mess up also is delayed and we are unlikely to make the connection again and won’t be making it to our destination unless we want to fly to Miami and try and drive and pay extra money for a car. An awfully expensive trip to just get screwed over. Huge waste of money and a huge waste of time. If you’re thinking about flying American Airlines don’t. You will absolutely regret it and they will not take care of you! Terrible company, terrible people!"
133,"  Paris to Chicago. The flight in itself was fine. The flight attendants were fine and usually cooperative. However, they needed cajoling as usual to get what you had wanted. i.e. You either had to flag one down as they just walk right by you or corner them in the galley or aisle.  When you or your company is spending thousands of dollars though, you'd expect a higher service level. On this flight out of Paris, the catering or meals were very good. I had the beef which was very tender with cheddar mashed potatoes. The appetizer of shrimp with a spicier sauce was delicious. The Ben & Jerry's vanilla ice cream sundae with hot fudge, butterscotch, whipped cream, cherries, berries and nuts was great. Plenty of en-route snacks like fresh fruit, packaged cookies, chips and so on to munch on. The arrival meal was a lighter smaller beef ale pie and a chicken mushroom one. Also good. What I don't like is when you get a malfunctioning business class lie flat bed or seat like I did, there is no where to move. This cabin was full. This is very annoying and the airline should ensure these seats work each and every flight with their maintenance programs (if they so care). I have to rate this flight 3 stars because of that."
134,"Not Verified | Sydney to Baltimore via Dallas. After flying five hours from Perth to Sydney and then 15 more to Dallas I had an 8-hour layover till my flight to BWI. There was another flight boarding at 234 so asked to get on that so I wouldn’t have wait 8 hours, so I go to customer service and ask and she goes already closed, meanwhile I could see people getting in. I don’t know why Qantas you would partner with such an airline as American. The staff seem to have no idea what they are doing. Their computers say gate closed but people still boarding. Maybe they need retraining."
135,"  Dallas to Sacramento. Terrible and unprofessional flight attendant, who was serving beverages on board. Arrogant and impatient to what I asked for. "
136,"  Embarrassing how unprepared this flight was. Delayed 3 times once we got on, now I am going to miss my connection in Dallas. I travel for work 90% of the year and I vowed I would never fly American again, but unfortunately my company needed me somewhere and the only option was American. They didn’t fail to disappoint however, flight delayed 3 times and now we are sitting on the runway for another 20 min for “unknown” reason. This one and only chance I have to this horrible airline proved everything I have stood for. I will drive across the country from now on before I have to travel with American Airlines again."
137,"  Albuquerque to Chicago. My second time riding with American and it was great! My sister and I booked basic economy. Due to our tickets, our seats were separated. Fortunately, one of the flight attendants saw us talking prior to boarding. She offered us an empty row, so we both can sit together. Also, Inflight entertainment was great since I can use AA website on my phone for free to watch live tv or movies."
138,"  I was very disappointed with the way I was treated traveling from Memphis to bBuffalo. We arrived to the check in desk in Memphis and the lady was so rude and she told us that American Airlines had changed our flight from fly from Memphis to Washington DC then from there to buffalo to going through Chicago because the Washington DC one was delayed. While you might think at first, this was a good thing and I thought it was to until once we were through security we were told the flight that American had rescheduled us on was delayed from 10 to 12 and then later they delayed it again We did not end up boarding the plane till about 1:30 it ended up being a same three seat 20 row plane which was cramped. Then we missed the connection flight that American Airlines set up for us to get on because our connection flight left at 3:00 and since our other flight was delayed three time we did not even land in Chicago till 3:00 and the next flight to buffalo is at 7:01 you can understand how frustrating this can be. We arrived at the airport at 8:00am expecting to be home around 4:30pm and now we will not be getting home till around 10:30pm that’s a total of about 14 hours I will be spending in these air port."
139,"Not Verified |  If you can avoid flying American Airlines, most likely you will do yourself a favor. They change my itinerary without informing me. They give me a new itinerary that involved 2 days travel plus an overnight at my expense. Baggage needed to be checked twice for the same trip at my expense. They demand payment for my golf bag of $200.00 US. My golf bag weighed 42 lbs. Overall a very bad experience with people in reservation, customer service and the agents and ticketing counters."
140," Charlotte to Indianapolis with American Airlines. The worst airline of all! Everyday, every flight, they seem to lower the bar and prove they are the worst. Flights are always delayed, service is bad and unprofessional. If there’s a way they can make passengers miserable, they find it and do it. I’ll take a later flight from a different airline as they still get there sooner. Never again!"
141, Nashville to Philadelphia. I had the most wonderful experience aboard this aircraft. I was greeted with smiles from the young lady scanning my ticket to the kind flight attendant whom I had such fun guessing where his accent was from. If you want to have a lovely flight I would suggest flying from Nashville to Philadelphia if this crew is on board. I fly frequently and American has moved to the top of my list for preferred airlines. Thank you for such a great experience! (As a reminder to the public - share your good experiences as much as you share your bad. The world will be a more beautiful place for it)
142,Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Columbus. This is by far the most poorly trained staff I’ve ever experienced flying. With not much time before my flight I needed help finding the fastest way of getting my boarding pass and going through security. When told I couldn’t check in at the front desk they gave me a late check in slip and told me to go to the security line. When I got to the security line they wouldn’t allow me through without a boarding pass which was not given to me by the American Airlines staff. Due to the back and forth of being pointed in the wrong direction by 3 different American Airlines employees I eventually missed my flight which I needed to make for work. Train our staff for these situations because you clearly don’t understand or seem to care about the impact misinformation and general cluelessness by “professionals” under your company can do to someone. 
143," My friends and I were supposed to be flying to New Orleans but our flight was cancelled due to weather. The airline promised us over the phone that if they flew us to Mississippi instead that they would reimburse us for any car rental costs to get us to our final destination. We agreed to fly to Mississippi because of this agreement. They said we can just call them and they'll walk us through how to get the refund and it will be an easy process. Once the trip was complete I called the airline and they said they can't do anything over the phone and to contact their customer support email. I did so and they said there's nothing they can do and they don't refund car rentals ever. There was a lot of back and forth, I explained that we were guaranteed a refund and they refused to honour that guarantee and kept repeating that they got us to Mississippi and that was their only responsibility. Horrible customer service. Will never fly with American Airlines again."
144,"  Las Vegas to Dallas. We boarded on time, things were looking good, and then we sat on the runway for an hour. Then we got off the plane and found out it would be another hour at least(its been 2 now). I missed my connecting flight and had to reschedule but the soonest flight wont get me to my destination until tomorrow mid morning. Wouldn't have been a big deal except I am now paying for a hotel room that I'm not using, missing my husband's graduation from basic training, and paying $300 for a rental car. I would not recommend this airline to anyone."
145,"Not Verified |  San Antonio to Albuquerque via Dallas. I had the worst experience in my 40 years of flying with this airline. Late flights, which caused me to miss a flight, I did get on a flight that put me in Albuquerque at one o’clock in the morning (it was late, also) and to add insult to injury, my luggage was still in Dallas. They had five and a half hours to get their act together and get the luggage in the right place. I am still waiting for my luggage to be delivered to me. I have been told it is out for delivery, but no sign of it yet. They also kept changing gates for the flight that kept getting delayed. The bus would’ve been faster. Nope, not flying American again."
146,"  Nashville to Laredo via Dallas. I was supposed to depart at 6:30 AM arriving in Laredo at 11:09 AM for a meeting. Went to bed early for the early to find a text indicated my flight was delayed to 12:00 PM - they rebooked me on the 5:00 AM - arriving 12:39 PM. Every flight I have taken on this airline this year have had at least one leg with problems. When it happens, the indifference their staff showed to passengers was appalling. Their problem started with their people, which explain equipment problems then operational problems"
147,"  Miami to Georgetown. I am so upset with this airline. They have the worst customer service both in person and on the phone. I missed my flight because they gave me the wrong gate code. The gate code that they sent me via text said that it’s departing at gate E31. I checked on the information screen posted all over the airport and the the same gate was written and said gate E31. There was no recent text or update after that and when I went to the gate, there was nobody there and I checked the online status and the gate change to D60. The person I talked to at the rebooking booth literally told me that I should be checking their online app. I thought that the information provided via information screen all over the airport are updated as well. I also opted to get text notification for any changes but there was none sent out. They wanted me to call the number and the wait was an hour long. They can’t do anything for me. They won’t even allow me to book to the next earlier flight that they have because the connecting flight is not American Airlines. They obviously only want to book it through their airlines. They could have book me a flight to Nassau and got a connecting flight from there but they refused to do so. They wanted me to wait the next day for their airline. I even showed the guest services the pictures and text that I received and yet nothing was done for me at all and I am stuck in the airport for two days. This is the worst airline so far."
148,  Honolulu to Los Angeles. When we showed up to check our bags on our return flight nobody was working the baggage counter.  Apparently this airport in Honolulu baggage claim closes for 5 hours in the morning from 7-12 and American Airlines failed to mention it. When I called they said I didn’t call to check the baggage counter hours so I am to blame. This airline is the only airline to close their baggage counter in the airport. They refused to assist in any way. I will never fly American Airlines again. 
149,"  Norfolk to Peoria via Charlotte. This is a customer service review, not a flight review. I had military obligations come up requiring me to be on duty for the date of my flight so I would not be able to make my flight. They said I would not be able to cancel my flight or move it unless it was a change of order and first had to contact the commanding officer. Anyone with military experience knows that is unreasonable considering a CO doesn’t have time to deal with moving someone’s flight. They were not willing to assist any further than that. If you’re military I recommend looking elsewhere."
150,"  Hong Kong to Tucson via Los Angeles. Out bound was fine, 4-6 hr layover at each airport, but easy to get from plane to plane. Coming back. Land in LAX at the remote international terminal and have to go through immigration (expected that) easy transport to the connecting flight - no. After immigration have to go through security (pretty stupid since I just got seen by 3 immigration people) then I have to walk myself out the building and over to the next terminal, then go through security again because they can't bus you directly to your connecting gate or at least to the main terminal with out you leaving and reentering, then my flight isn't on the board so have to ask 3 different AA personnel who give three vastly different answers on where my flight will be (each answer has me go to a totally different terminal) before my flight is finally put up on the board and I have to take a bus to another remote terminal (at least I didn't have to go through security again). Yes half of this review is on LAX but in reality when the airline leases the gates at the remote terminals they also contract how to get their passengers to/from those terminals and their connecting flights. Especially when the connecting flight is with a partner airline."
151,"  Charlotte to Dayton. I rarely fly so I don’t know the ropes. While the staff at the ticket counter were friendly and helpful, the woman at the counter outside the plane and the stewardess were condescending and rude. Such treatment of customers in my business would not be tolerated."
152,"  Dallas to Lima via Miami. American Airlines never fails to screw up a trip in every which way, then not properly compensate. I was supposed to be in Lima on this Wednesday evening at the nice hotel I booked, so I could fly to Cusco in the morning Thursday. They were boarding us onto our original flight which was Scheduled for 345 this afternoon From Miami, and as we were boarding they stopped boarding and said something was wrong with the plane so they sent us to another gate. 2.5 hours later they boarded us onto another plane where we flew for 30 minutes before they turned it around for another mechanical failure (one engine literally wasn’t working And we were greeted by a dozen firetrucks all surrounding the plane). We were then directed to the service desk, where I stood in line with 500 other people for 3.5 hours in line so that I could just get a meal voucher and a hotel. I had a flight from Lima to Cusco tomorrow, but they said since I didn’t book the Lima to Cusco through them they can’t help, and they also can’t help that I have to find accommodations in lima tomorrow night because of this. On top of everything, they kept all our bags so there are no clean clothes or toiletries. They made me check my carry on too, so my valuables and medicine are now sitting in the airport for 24 hours. So I lost a day, $600 dollars, sleep. I'm still waiting for the shuttle to take me to the hotel in Miami, and I won’t be there until after midnight tonight The only airline worse than American is Spirit."
153,"  London to St. Louis via Dallas Ft Worth. Flight was leaving from a remote stand, so since I need assistance I was delivered to the plane via a lift. After boarding we were put on a 30 minute hold by the tower which is not abnormal for Heathrow. Arrived late in Dallas to find that I was already re-booked and assisted to the plane. The flight from London was wonderful with attentive flight attendants and very good food. The IFE was up to date and easy to use. I didn't try using the Wi-Fi. The flight to St Louis was on a A319 which I find confining even in first class. Overall a good experience; very well taken care of."
154,"  Do not fly this airline! Our trip started out flying from Los Angeles (LAX) to Dallas (DFW), then onto Paris (CDG), then to Munich (MUN) for Oktoberfest. The flight from LAX to DFW was ok which is the only reason I gave a 1 out of 5 rating. Where the trip went sideways was during our layover in DFW. We experienced a 30-minute or so delay to board the plane - no big deal, as intentionally purchased a ticket from CDG to MUN with a longer layover in case anything happened. So once all passengers were on the plane roughly 30 minutes behind schedule, we sat there for another 2-hours before actually taking off. After patiently sitting in our seats for about one hour, I knew I had to speak up about our connecting flight to make the American Airline team aware of the situation. The flight attendant assured me we would be taking off ""very shortly"" and we would ""make up time"" while in the air, so I shouldn't worry. I was reluctant to believe the flight attendant so I asked if we could exit the plane to catch another flight to Paris. She would not let us leave the plane. Rather than make a scene, which would have been no good for anyone, I chose to sit back down and wait patiently for our departure. We finally took off after sitting there for 2-hours! Of course, we did not make up any time while in the air and I'm almost certain we saw the Lufthansa connecting flight take off for Munich as we landed. Trying to keep my calm, I told the same flight attendant that we missed our connecting flight due to their delay. She said, ""you'll need to call customer service and take it up with them."" No apology, no help whatsoever with sorting it out. We got off the plane and I immediately called customer service. They shouldn't even have ""service"" in their name because they didn't do a damn thing to help, they were terribly rude. No empathy, no apology, nothing. Customer service said, ""well, you took the flight, so there is nothing we can do."" Of course, we took the flight because they wouldn't let us off the plane even after sitting there for hours! Already late to our Oktoberfest plans, I was then forced to spend another 650 EURO for two tickets from Paris to Munich. Called customer service again and demanded a refund for our flight or at least credit towards another flight. Nothing, but rude attendants on the other line saying, ""there is nothing we can do""."
155,"Not Verified |  Miami to Havana. Terrible experience with American Airlines, supervisor refused to allow me to take my bicycle after I called American Airlines Customer service 3 times before my flight! When she refused me after I had prepared my bike as per the requirements given to me by the customer service at American Airlines. I contacted customer service right there and they told me what they had told me 3 times before and the ""supervisor"" refused to speak to them. I had been dropped off at the airport at 3:30am! I didn't have anywhere to leave my bike and still the supervisor didn't care. I have never received worse treatment in any airline. I have written a complaint and I hope that someone tries to rectify this situation."
156,"  Orlando to La Guardia via Charlotte. American is consistent at one thing: mediocrity. They have a poor understanding of experience, and are seemingly doing nothing about it. Today the delay was poorly communicated (with only 1 announcement and no updates with an over 30min delay), no apologies, zero capability to flight plan, especially with connections. They offered no support to passengers who were delayed and no one took responsibility. Almost every other airline I’ve flown globally have this capability. Customer experience is overtly and embarrassingly low propriety to this profit-focused business. Avoid them!! There are other options, even if it means giving up a lounge access or points, just do it. The stress of this terrible airline isn’t worth it."
157,Not Verified |  American Airlines will not make any attempt to cover lost baggage.  They also have notorious horrible customer service. Do not fly them if you value your belongings.They lost my bag on a flight from Nashville to Miami in July. After months of time spent filling out questionnaires and sitting on hold they refused to provide any compensation.
158,"Not Verified | London Heathrow to Dallas. I checked in ahead and paid for a premium economy seat. I wanted to be a bit more comfortable on this 10 hour flight. My previous flight landed at London Heathrow late causing me to have to run with my backpack and suitcase to the American Airlines check-in. I check in as my flight to Dallas was boarding! The check-in crew was extremely helpful and directed me to go straight to my gate and not worry about my luggage as they will take care of it. I get to the gate and what do I discover?! Due to my late check in my premium economy seat was given to someone else! I was upset. I paid extra and now I’m stuck with a regular economy seat. I received my new seat an aisle seat just what I like! To my surprise the seat was not bad! It was a 3-row seat and the row behind me was a 2-row seat. I was able to recline my seat all the back knowing that no one was directly behind me. The service by the attendants was amazing! The drink cart constantly moving up and down the aisles. The snacks kept coming. The meal was quite delicious. And the pizza right before landing was spot on. I never felt like we weren’t being cared for. The movie selection was great! A loved seeing newer released movies available to watch. I have no complaints besides my seat being given up. I did, however, receive my money back for the unused seat. I will definitely fly American Airlines again for a long haul flight."
159," Boston to Antigua via Miami. Absolute nightmare. The flight out of Boston delayed due to maintenance issues. This caused us to miss the connector. As a result, we ended up spending the night in Miami, then wasting the whole next day, spending the night in San Juan. The airline really didn’t seem to care, as a matter of fact, one representative said that this was a good experience to learn how to deal with adult disappointment. Being given to $12 meal vouchers over the course of two days in no way made up for missing two days at the all-inclusive luxury resort I had already paid for in Antigua. Not to mention the issues with my traveling companion‘s luggage. She literally only had the clothes on her back for two days. Definitely stay away from American Airlines. I tried calling the corporate office when we first started having issues only to get a voice message recording saying the office was closed and to call back during regular business hours. This call was made at 3 PM Eastern standard time, which means it was probably around one in the afternoon in Texas where the corporate office is listed. It’s no wonder they’re doing such a terrible job if they close the office before noon on Fridays. Not only did American Airlines rob me of basically the better part of three days of vacation, but they also made me never want to ever fly again. I will certainly never flying American Airlines again. Please tell everyone you know."
160," Frankfurt to Austin. I had a very humbling experience traveling because I ended up missing my flight and was very disappointed. Your team at American Airlines in Frankfurt were unbelievably helpful! I just wanted to take the time to praise AA customer service! Keep up the hard work, it’s much appreciated!"
161,"Not Verified |  San Diego to Omaha. I had a 10:40pm flight out of San Diego. The flight attendant was late, and so the flight had to be cancelled (after we were already on the plane). The next flight wasn't until 3pm the following day. As we were being kicked off the flight, they told us they would pay for our hotel for the night (since there were no more flights). I went to my hotel, and booked a flight with Southwest Airlines at 10am the next morning so I could get back when I needed to. After contacting American Airlines, they said since I did not book my replacement flight with them, they wouldn't cover my hotel room. I expect cancellations and delays with airlines, but when their mistake greatly inconveniences their customers, I would expect them to go above and beyond in taking care of them. I will not be flying American Airlines again."
162,"Not Verified |  Lawton to Oklahoma via Birmingham. This is the first time I have flown American Airlines and it will be my last. Every flight that I have gotten on has been delayed for whatever reason and they have no sympathy for anything. They don't try to fix the issue and I hate their horrible custom service. Spirit and Southwest was so much better. I have learned my lesson. The food was horrible and if I could give 0 stars for the seats, food, and service I would. I'm am not a fat person. I am thick and their was no room to sit comfortably and the seat belts were extremely short. A waste of money."
163,"Not Verified | Charlotte to Port of Spain. This review has nothing to do with my flight this review has to do with our planned move to Trinidad. My wife has been working for six months to transport our husky with us. She has only called American Airlines Animal Transport and to her dissatisfaction. She was told originally (6 months ago) to measure the dog from paw to ear and add 3 to 4 inches of space in the carrier. We bought our carrier based on what we were told. (34 inches tall) Only to call back today a month before our flight to verify everything and find out that anything over 28 inches tall cannot go through the cargo hole which she has never been told on any of the conversations she has had with them! Now with our flights booked, we find that our dog cannot go with us on American Airlines because she’s too tall they will not allow it! Dogs are like children. We need to get the correct answers when we call about them. It’s hard enough flying in with the dog to a foreign country that requires so much paperwork and tests to now have to deal with a non-pet friendly airline! It’s bad enough that we had to make our flights so they wouldn’t get booked but can’t make hers until 10 days before we leave and if there’s no room then we have to deal with changing our flights. Now, this! What a disappointment!"
164,"  I had tickets on an AA flight out of Tampa this morning flight 1369. It was supposed to leave the gate at 7:28 am. I arrived on time more than 2 hours prior to my flight. They start boarding the airplane about 6:45. I hear the crew saying the pilots are not there yet as I board and they don't know what is wrong. Then they announce that the pilots came in late on their flight the night before so they couldn't leave Tampa until 8:45 am. Well many of us on this flight will not make our 1 hour connections. (especially since now I find out I have to go to a different terminal in Dallas). They will not hold our other American flights for us. Now I am going to visit my daughter in Korea. I haven't seen her in awhile. She wants to show me around for 16 days. Well we even have plans with her friends that next night for dinner and on Nov 3rd we have tickets for a formal tea room. Not going to get that money back. $101. Airbnb paid for 2 nights before I get there. Now I pay for that and she didn't need to get there early then. Then AA says they can send me to Dallas on this flight and they will put me up in a hotel overnight. I say why? I live here in Tampa all be it an hour from the airport so I want to go home to my bed. They refused to send me out on any other flight that is leaving today from Tampa from a competitor. And my bags are now going to Dallas and will be stuck there. Plus I had paid ahead of time for a premium seat to have a little more room for the 15 hour flight by a window. Now on the next days flights they can't get me a window seat in premium. They refuse to upgrade me to business or First class for my problems. This is the big blow now. After I deplaned I am at the desk talking to them about getting me on a different flight and the pilots arrive at 8:15. They say it will still be 8:45 before they can take off. One of the pilots tells the crew there that they had come in late the night before from somewhere so FAA regulations say they can't fly until their rest hours are done. Then he rolls his eyes at them and says, "" AA knew this last night."" So 12 hours before AA could have checked our tickets and tried to reroute us then. There happens to be a 6:00 am flight to Dallas they have. They could have called me to come to the airport early. But nothing done like that. They just play with peoples lives and don't care. Now if will be up to 60 days before they respond to my complaint online. Yah that will help me. In Europe the EU has passed laws that the airlines are fined $700 euros for doing what they did. This is the second time in a year that one of my flights in the US has screwed me. This doesn't happen when I am in Europe. Shame on you AA. Playing with your paying customer. (so now I leave the next day at 6:00 am and hopefully things will be on time. But no window seat in Premium only a middle seat. Wow I paid extra for a better seat but now get the middle one."
165," Cleveland to Denver. American Airlines is the most disgusting and inhumane airlines I have ever dealt with. We had a puppy being shipped on a Tuesday and the airline canceled it. Then it was rescheduled for Thursday. The puppy was picked up from the breeders home at 6am and didn't get put on his flight and the airline could not justify why. Then he got put on a later flight which then got delayed and delayed and eventually canceled at 1am. Throughout this time, the airline continuously lied to me and had people from call centers in India speaking to me about my puppy. They lied to me saying the puppy was then taken to ""Pet Hotels and Villas"" which never happened. Puppy Hotels and Villas never had any record of my puppy going there. So where is my puppy? American Airlines will lie to you until you stop calling them or give up. They leave puppies to sit in crates for 12 hours. Who is walking them? Feeding them? Giving them water? Where are the pictures and proof that my puppy is okay? I would never recommend American Airlines unless you want to be mistreated, lied to, and taken advantage of. This has been an ongoing, 4 day battle with them, and I have still not received my puppy. Who is taking care of him? The airlines has no clue."
166,Not Verified |  Jacksonville to Charlotte. Worst experience ever. I had a flight that left at around 1:30 pm where I would arrive to my destination around 3:30 pm for a wedding I had at 5:39 pm where I was a bridesmaid. I booked my flight at least 6 months before. The day I was headed to the airport they cancelled the flight with no care of my concern to get to a wedding. I couldn’t believe that they not only didn’t care but didn’t help me get another flight. If I can help it I will never fly American Airlines again.
167, Communication is horrible. They told us to board and the plane wasn’t ready. Won’t let us wait by the gates and the gate area is overcrowded. They have 4 delayed planes at the same gate
168,Not Verified |  Fayetteville to Denver. This was my first attempt at using American Airlines. Though I’d heard bad things I still wanted to give it a fair shake. Upon purchase of tickets I got an email instructing me to be there 45 min early for check in. When I got to the airport I was told that I should have been there an hour early and my seat had been given away. I said my wife and I were expecting to land in Denver to meet family so I needed to get on another flight. They said the next two were full and there is no refund. I called customer service and they said there is nothing they could do. AA should be ashamed of their poor service. 
169,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Phoenix. I bought a $300 one way to get to Oak at noon. Dallas delayed cause the weather, we made it to Phoenix 6 minutes after start boarding the gate was close, airplane still there!!! We were line 9 people all together, wait until 7.36 PM To San Francisco not Oakland - no meal voucher, nothing because the weather; they knew we were delayed - why not wait 5 minutes? "
170,"  Miami to Denver. I booked a flight from Miami to Denver for November 8, 2019. American Airlines changes the flight to a 7am flight. I call and let them know that I can’t make it, so the lady tells me the only other nonstop is 9.30am. So I agreed to that. When I looked up my reservation I realized that she booked me on a 9.30pm flight! I call the customer service line and when I explain the situation I basically get told that because I already made One change (which I had to because of the change the airline made) that I couldn’t make any more changes that I had to buy a whole new plane ticket and get zero credit towards a new one. Then talked down to me because I bought an “economy” ticket and that’s what happens when you buy “economy”. There was zero effort in helping me with this situation when the airline made its changes. Not only does American Airlines nickel and dime you for everything possible to fly in their poor  aircraft, but they like to make you feel like worthless nobodies for booking economy. I will never book through this airline again. We do not deserve to be treated this way. Giving them a 1/10 and that goes to the pilot for getting us economy people to our destination safely."
171,"Not Verified |  I flew as an Unaccompanied Minor from Phoenix to Philadelphia. Although my ticket was bought only 4 days in advance, and the only seats available were Basic Economy Middle Seats (Which is what i got in the end), my boarding group was 9 but Boarding staff were nice and pleasant, and bumped me up to Group 7. The Flight attendants were nice and respectful. The seat was comfortable, food was nice, on-board entertainment above expected. Seemed to have a better experience on American than Southwest. "
172,  Managua to Miami. Awful service. I required a wheelchair and requested one to take me from the arrival gate (Miami International Airport) to Baggage Claim. I waited more than 2 hours  to be picked up. It was just awful service. I called customer service (800-433-7300) and was told that somebody would pick me up eventually. To just wait and call back in half an hour. Worst service ever
173,  Lima to Salt Lake City via Dallas. Leaving Lima the plane was late 1.5 hrs. We all get that happens. But the airline made no attempt to make up time in the air over this 8 hour flight. The flight attendant lied about letting us deboard first so we could make our next flights. Every single employee along this journey was not only not helpful they were rude and seemed annoyed with us attempting to make connecting flights. They didnt care in the least. Never ever American again.
174,"  Miami to Cancun. The Captain came out into the cabin to  thank us for flying American Airlines. I have not flown American in over a year because I was very disappointed at previous experiences however I have to say that this flight was very pleasant, the ground and in-flight crew were very nice, polite, and friendly. The aircraft looked and felt new, the business class seat was very comfortable and the amenities were good for a 1 hour 40 minute flight. I will fly them again. "
175," St Louis to London Heathrow via Dallas Fort-Worth with American Airlines. The first flight was almost 2 hours late but I had plenty of time for the connection. The Flagship Lounge at DFW was wonderful with extremely helpful personnel, great food. The flight from DFW to LHR was on-time, the seat was extremely comfortable, the food awful: terrible presentation, overcooked, and tasteless. IFE was great but the remote did not work properly. Wifi was impossible to use."
176,"  Milan to New York. Hands down worst business class experience I have ever had. Long wait at priority check in for both legs of the flight, poor onboard service, cranky stewardesses. In business class had to pay extra $20 for WiFi! Last but not least, headphones were collected 1 hour prior to landing!"
177,"  Charlotte to Albany. Why does an American Airlines separate people when one purchases tickets for two people at the same time? Doesn't make sense to me - especially when you're  not allowed to pick your own seating and they have some excuse as to why they have to pick your seat. Very very disappointing and planes late with no giving reason, just gets later and later. I'll never fly this airline again."
178,"Not Verified |  Dallas Fort Worth to Seattle. This airline is Not worth your business. You spend more money with accommodations and car rentals. Better spend your money on a ticket that will get you to your destination without the hassle and rudeness. Customer service agents are rude and look at you like you’re begging them. In less than three months that I’ve travelled with my new job, I’ve been stuck in Seattle because their flights are delayed, leaving me stranded at the airport or having to rent a car to get home. No reimbursement for these additional expenses. So you pay for a round trip flight and you still end up spending more because of their delays. Go spend your money on another airline. American should just give up instead of offering flights that are always running 3-4 hours behind. And, when you show up to the counter, it’s mid night, no one is available to speak with. When my wife traveled with them in July, same thing happened only worse because she had to wait two days before she could get home. Long story short, she ended up paying for her meals, her hotel, used more time off from work, and leaving our pets boarding for more time than originally planned. Horrible, horrible service. Worst airline ever."
179,  Dallas to Honolulu. First and last time I will fly with American! Not only did my plane get delayed over an hour but when we finally did get to fly out we got about 2 hours away and then had to turn around and go all the way back to Dallas. From there our plane got delayed another 2-3 times. Was suppose to land in HI at 12:36P did not land until 9:36!
180,"Not Verified |  Worst experience ever with an airline. Flight was delayed 8 hours. 8! We paid to go hang out at their lounge only to find out the flight was cancelled overall. We were trying to fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo for our honeymoon. Our paid time off days were on the line here. Did they try to make us feel less panicked? Nope! Talked to one of the reps (who turned her ID around so we wouldn’t know her name!) who argued with my husband and I about how she was not at fault. We understand that personally, it was not on her but as other airlines do- probably find us an alternate way to get there? She was grabbing the ticket from my husband and pointing out the obvious about how the flight was cancelled. Ok captain obvious we get it. But what can you do to help us? Maybe work with another airline? Find us other seats? Something? We have been in the terminal since 6am and it is not 3pm and we just found out your plane was cancelled. We are not oblivious to the fact that others are also facing these circumstances but the least we expect is some empathy and reassurance. The lounge member was super rude, condescending, yelling at us and was straight mean. She tried to shoo us away to another airline eventually, but with no reassurance. Take note, this was with an airline 2 terminals away at LAX. Would you feel ok walking all that way if you weren’t 100% sure? She would not tell us if we could board or not and we tried to ask if they would guarantee taking care of us if we did not make the cut and she would not answer. It took another co-worker of hers to butt in and tell us they would. Super unprofessional, does not care for their customers, rude and not sympathetic whatsoever. I don’t care if I’m saving 1,000 bucks.. I will never fly American again! They ruined my honeymoon."
181,  Minneapolis to Erie via Chicago. Well I didn’t even get on the flight because it was delayed 4+ hours and I wouldn’t be able to make my connecting flight. The trip wasn’t worth it at that point since it was a weekend trip and there weren’t any other options that made sense. I stood in line for about 30 minutes and was able to figure out what I needed to know by the time I got up there and the assistant didn’t know that much anyways. Very disappointed. Luckily got refunded but I’m never booking with American Airlines again.
182,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Fayetteville. I never had such a worst experience in my life. To start, when i departed from Fayetteville to Vancouver ; my flight from Fayetteville got delayed by 4-5 hours i had to spent half day sitting at airport and missed to catch up with my friend. From Vancouver to Dallas flight no. 392 was so much congested there was almost no leg space. And the passenger at the front seat was extending their seat to back making it more less spacious. I literally had sore feet because of that and Then to my worst experience when flight from dallas airport got cancelled to Fayetteville. They didnt even provide us any accommodation i hadnt slept for more than 24 hours. They should have at least provide us some place to stay even though it was weather still we paid you and please value our time. I missed one exam already and now have two next day."
183,  Hartford to Philadelphia. Horrible - switched my seat at boarding to the last row of the plane. Told me my carry on was too big as it fit into the measurements. Poor customer service - rude - will not travel with them again.
184,"  Tampa to Miami. I fly pretty frequent and I have to say today will be the last time I travel American Airlines. I am boarding flight 2179 to Miami, and my boarding pass says my seat will be assigned at gate. The gentleman who appears to be the captain of flight was very kind and says, don’t worry someone will assist your shortly. The gentleman who’s the counter rep doesn’t acknowledge me while logging into the system, talks to some of the crew members around him, and then asked me what do I want - even a good morning. He noticed I was not pleased and says good morning how are you, this is after he’s ignored me the 10 min I’m standing in front and chatting with crew. Not one person said, take care of the customer standing there being ignored. I’m very much a believer In giving all you do your all, or don’t do it all. And I just think the customer service with American is by far the worse I’ve experienced. Employees are just unhappy and miserable and so I just thought I share my feedback flight #2179 seat 17C."
185,"  London to Houston. The seats were so tightly together one could not take off a sweater, tie a shoe, pick up a bag from under a seat in front of the place of sitting. I am a regular female US size 12. I could feel the legs and hips on either side of me of the people who were sitting beside me who also not overweight. One cannot moves legs or shift at all. It is a physical danger of sitting in limited confined spaces for hours on end with no ability to move in any way. I recommend not using this airline.  It is better for an airline to charge a bit more and treat the customers physical being safely than put their health at risks. I was astonished to see the seating set up as it was. I simply do not know how men could sit in the seats when I was having such a hard time in doing so."
186,Not Verified | LaGuardia to Portland. American airlines is incompetent beyond words. No announcement of a gate change. Horribly rude. Acted like it was our fault that we missed the flight when we were there and checked in 90 minutes before flight time. disgusting disrespect of passenger time and needs.
187, London to Los Angeles. Appalling. American Airlines got me in an hour late to LAX so I missed my connecting flight. Now I have a 12-hour overnight wait and they refuse to give even a cup of coffee let alone a room for the night.
188,Not Verified | Dallas to Saint Louis. This is the worst airline in the entire world. I will never in my life fly this airline again and furthermore I will tell all friends and family never to fly this airline. I have flown several times and every single time the flight is delayed 4-5-6 hours. It’s stupid and ridiculous. Trash airline that should be shut down.
189,"  London to Raleigh Durham. I bought the ticket on Saturday 7/20/19and travelled on Monday 7/22/19. I did not have a chance to book a seat but was given the only one available (I was told) at a high cost because it was booked in an emergency. I am 75 and was a wheelchair passenger. I was reprimanded by a very unpleasant flight attendant for using the toilet in Business. When I boarded I asked a flight attendant if I could use the toilet in Business, which was near to seat 15E Premium Plus, she said “ yes, that is quite acceptable”. I explained to her I have a weak bladder and have to use the toilet more often. Halfway through the flight, on approaching Business toilets, one flight attendant said to me that I should use the toilet at the back. (This was not the flight attendant from whom I had asked permission). I did not reply but I tried the toilets in the center of the aircraft (which were always busy with passengers standing on the aisle waiting) and I tried to use the toilets at the back of the aircraft but it was too much of a distance for me.  When I next approached Business Toilets the same flight attendant (who had told me to use the back toilets) approached me and said in a rude and condescending way that I should be using the toilets at the back. I told her then that I had asked the other flight attendant for permission when I first boarded and was told I could use the toilets in Business. She looked surprised. I reported this to the Department of Transportation, and to AA but the flight attendant denied telling me not to use the toilets in Business. I would like to say that when booking Premium or any upgrade one should find out where the toilets are and if one is allowed to use Business toilets when nearer to Business than the middle or back of aircraft. It is my belief that AA does not consider the toilets locations when selling seats at a higher priced upgrade. I have since found out from the Department of Transportation that elderly and wheelchair passengers can be exempt from the airline rules that a passenger should use the toilets nearest to their seat."
190,"  Chicago to State College. Use another airline! I purchased my flight and had strict travel needs. American Airlines told me that they overbooked the flight and I was denied boarding. Consequently, I had to rent a car and drive all night to ensure I could meet my obligations. Evidently, they always overbook the flights with the idea they’ll solicit some to give up their seats. How can they sell seats they don’t have? Never use this airline! They don’t deserve your loyalty or respect since they give none to their customers."
191,"Not Verified |  Charlotte to Denver. This has been by far the worst experience I have had flying to and from my wedding/honeymoon! Every time I asked for help kindly and calmly, for example that the customer service agents (4 of them) when asked to please help as I am physically running to my transfer flight, looked at me like I was dumb. We then proceeded to run through the airport, my wife began to vomit.  Also, due to the delays I don't get to spend the night in my honeymoon suite with my wife but instead on the airport floor and lost my hotel $."
192,"Not Verified | Dallas to Columbus. Would not recommend. Pay up and get a reliable trip booked through another airline. Even though open seats are open on other flights they will under no circumstances change your flight without getting another full charge. Also, very well known for delays and better at making excuses for those delays than addressing them. Do yourself a favor and book through a more credible airline."
193,"Not Verified | Dallas to Tokyo. On Thursday, October 10, I was scheduled to fly to Tokyo on AA175. When I arrived in Dallas they cancelled the flight 10 min before departure. They claimed it was because of a typhoon in Tokyo, yet Delta, Japan Airlines, and every other airline flew to Tokyo that day. The typhoon was not scheduled to arrive until Sunday the 13. They did not pay for my hotel in Dallas and they left 300 stranded passengers sitting in the airport lobby with only 2 agents rebooking people. Then every agent left and they told people to use the app or call customer service. I will never fly this airline again, and I have zero trust in American. Please avoid this airline as I ended up paying over $200 in hotels out of pocket."
194,  Phoenix to Boston. American's poor maintenance strikes again. 15 minutes before boarding they delay the flight 3 hours. They just realized the plane couldn't fly. Why they only realized it 15 minutes before boarding makes no sense. Then they delayed another 3 hours - 6 in total - because they couldn't find another airplane. To be certain we don't get too hopeful the customer service person said not to get too hopeful that plane will be cleared to fly to Boston. But they did provide 5 sandwiches for over 100 people and keep updating us on the progress of a different flight out of Portland. We are in Phoenix.
195,  New York JFK to Heathrow. Initially we booked on line and did not get our reservation for myself and my son but they were quick to take the payment On getting to the airport we had to go look for the business check in which was away from the gates and the check in counters for all other passengers. On checking in they had lost my sons booking and his seat he booked was given away and they could not allocate a seat we had to go to the lounge. Crazy they then haul the luggage back to the economy check in while we walk back the same way to go through customs. Customs are rude and obnoxious and do nothing the security search backs up and no one will pick up a tray and tell customers to pack trays. In the lounge No surprise they could do nothing and said we should go to the gate. Well the rudest woman was at the gate that snarled and after standing around for some time allocated a seat that was not a window seat as requested. We fly frequently and America airline ground staff must be the laziest and most obnoxious people around. We will never fly American Airlines again.
196," Houston to Dallas to Lubbock. Our flight with American Airlines was a disaster from the beginning. Charged $60 to book by phone with an agent, flights were late, airplane dirty, and in the Lubbock airport the gate number was never published on the flight boards and we almost missed our flight because we didn’t know which gate. When I mentioned this to the attendant at the desk, she acted as if she couldn’t have cared less - she didn’t ask me to explain she just acted dumb and confused."
197," 
Another poor experience with AAL: again, they refused to check my suitcase through to my final destination under the pretext of ""safety:"" I do not understand how having two separate tickets endangers safety when more than 700 airlines worldwide regularly interline baggage among themselves. It's really a question of ""laziness."" Why did we buy two separate tickets? It's a well-known travel agent cost saving measure and we save £900 by doing so. (It was colossally inconvenient to pass through immigration, collect our suitcases, take the train to T5, recheck suitcases, go through immigration & security again.) I flew on Alaska last month to Fort Lauderdale and they without question transferred my suitcase to Delta for the continuing trip to South America. Is American Airlines asserting that Alaska and Delta are unsafe carriers? I purchased a Lufthansa ticket last year from Chicago to Münster with a LH compensation voucher and so the connecting flight to it on United had to be issued separately. Are both United and Lufthansa unsafe operations according to American Airlines? But American regularly disservices the flying public. In August I was denied entry into the Admirals' Club at Roissy because their boarding pass reader wouldn't read my boarding pass (somehow that was MY fault). At my connexion city (London) they simply reissued the boarding pass so that their reader would admit me. But since when are human beings the tools of the computers? When their management doesn't allow them to make reasonable common sense decisions! In August I was charge 50€ for a suitcase to check even though I was Platinum elite and am allowed two suitcases complimentary. The pretext? The ticket was issued by Finnair. I am suing them now and have learnt that their defence will be that I used my Alaska FF account. I only changed from my AA account after they charged me the fee: who wants to patronised a company that rips off their best customers? They are dishonest and deceptive and should be sanctioned and regulated fully by the DOT. I must say I was surprised on board: everyone was professional and courteous - quite a surprise from American Air Lines where most stewardess have chips on their shoulders and check their bid sheets in the galley when they should be working."
198,Not Verified |  Vancouver to Phoenix. The flight was on-time leaving and arriving. The check in process took too long and was incomplete. Only one service agent was dealing with check ins with a queue that had a family with infants and 3 other service agents dealing with almost no one at the service kiosk. This meant longer wait for the family with infants. After checking in there was no plastic bags offered for the car seats and strollers that had to be checked in. This meant we had to go back to the check in counter after getting told by YVR oversize baggage people that the plastic bags were only available at at the check in counters. By the time we went to the check in counter the counters were not manned by anyone. We however found an American airline service agent at the kiosk area and asked for the plastic bags. There were no plastic bags available as cabinets were locked so the agent had to ask for the bags from Alaskan airlines. The service by flight was very bad. There was no help offered to adults with infants on boarding and during the flight when it was needed most. When flight attendant was asked to assist to put milk in the coffee she was not happy and showed that she was so and warned me condescendingly about scalding the baby with hot coffee - all the rudeness was unnecessary.
199,"  
Edinburgh to Philadelphia. We decided to Supposedly upgrade our flights on our vacation to Scotland, so we paid several thousand dollars to upgrade our seats for an enjoyable experience. What a huge, enormous mistake! We had one good flight out of six flights back-and-forth to Scotland. The only decent flight was between Phoenix and Edinburgh on a 777–200. Nice business class Seats, good service and average food. After that it all went downhill! I read reviews previous to leaving and was a little nervous about what to expect. I don’t normally listen to negative reviews completely but I should have! These were the worst seats I’ve ever experienced! The planes were old and dirty. The food was barely edible and the seating was extremely bad. I basically paid thousands of dollars to have hard seats that had a little bit more legroom and width. The last flight was over five hours and was the most uncomfortable flight of all! When I got on the third flight of the day and saw how bad the interior of the plane looked and how cramped it was it made me ill. My husband was sick and had to sit straight up sleeping the whole time! He tried to treat me to nice experience and instead we were angry all day about how much money we wasted! We had TV screens in “one” out of six planes. Even the business class had no screens even on the back of the seats. Almost all airlines have screens on the back of the seats even in economy. I had to “pay extra” for Wi-Fi and to download the American Airlines app to attempt to fill in the time when I was unable to sleep. They don’t tell you this until you get on the plane and then you have to rush to download the app and less you’ll have nothing the whole entire flight! Never again will we pay American Airlines for flights to anywhere within the US or around the world. The only positive comment is for the staff on these planes. With people complaining and uncomfortable they maintained their gracious composure. Hugely disappointed! Embarrassed for the people who have to work for that airline!"
200," Shreveport to Dallas. This flight was delayed because the Maintenance inspector did not do his job the night before the 6:45AM flight as he was scheduled and the flight crew was told he was doing. We completely boarded on time just to be told it would be at least an hour and ended up being 2 hours delayed when maintenance showed up for work routinely and did their inspection that was scheduled to be done the night before. This is the 5th flight of the last 6 in 3 months on AA that has been delayed for maintenance reasons. These excuses are unacceptable, unprofessional, and occur because there are no consequences for poor service. This disservice inconveniences thousands of people harms lives (I am a surgeon that AA has caused multiple people in pain to miss or delay their surgery with plenty of prep time for things to go wrong), has people missing important family events, and potentially loses businesses millions in transactions. The airlines should be held responsible financially for the damage they cause others from poor leadership and management."
201,Not Verified |  Savannah to Las Vegas. Our flight got canceled and we were put on standby. We sat in the first airport for 13 hours then we changed planes two more times total time 28 hours. The workers are so rude and when you ask questions they yell and tell you to have a seat. First experience and American Airlines made it the worst.
202, Rapid City to Phoenix. On Tuesday night our flight was canceled due to plane problems. Which can be understandable. But the next day all I got is delay delay delay emails when I tried to call and get more information it was like pulling teeth. What I do finally arrive for my flight they say it is now going to be another four hours late even though there was one taken off earlier which no one had contacted me or let me have that option. Very poor communication.
203," As a service member seeing his family for the first time in 8 months and only having the weekend to spend with them along as with my girlfriend I was bringing with me, I was very disappointed. Instead of arriving before 11am I didn’t get to my destination until 5.00pm. Things happen, but all but one of my connecting flights were delayed with one being delayed about 5 hours. Almost no compensation was given to me-only a reschedule to the flight that got me home after my day was spent in an airport and a couple of pretzel bags and canned drinks that they gave us while we had to spend the night in the airport. This was of course during the time that our connection flight was taking off. I will be avoiding this airlines whenever possible in the future."
204,  I am extremely disappointed by American Airlines. They are normally my airline of choice and I have put many of miles into them. That will no longer be the case. I had a connecting flight canceled due to “weather” even though there was a flight going out an hour later? Since it was due to weather we were offered no accommodations. When asked about this they said it was the pilots choice to delay or cancel ... since a flight went out an hour later I’d say that wasn’t due to weather but to crew.... ok but it gets better. We were put on standby on that late flight when we showed up somehow I was five on the list and my husband was 32? So I got called yet was told nothing could be done to get my husband on as well .. even though after I was called a group of four was called together then two more singles. When I asked the customer service desk about this I was told it was the computer. So I asked how the group of four managed to get out on the list together and they said luck of pushing the enter button .. what a joke... then was told since I also had booked an economy ticket it pretty much didn’t look good for me anyway from the beginning so that’s great to know that’s how this airline feels. Such a shame too because they have some great people we have encountered who work as attendant for this airline that this has now given them such a bad name in my book. Long story short I thought this was a great airline and now I have been completely proven wrong and they could care less.
205,"Not Verified |  
Our flight from Quito to Miami on Friday October 4, 2019 (LATAM Airlines flight 6303) was cancelled by American with no reason given. We were offered a flight out on the following Sunday. Both my traveling partner and I had to work on Saturday. The website did not respond nor did anyone answer the 800 # given. We had no choice but to get to the airport in hopes of talking with a real person. We stood in line for LATAM airlines and managed to get a flight on Avianca from Quito to San Salvador to Cancun on American to Philadelphia, landing in Philadelphia about 4 hours later than our originally scheduled arrival. Why we were not offered that with the flight cancellation? How can an airline just leave a passenger stranded like that?"
206,"  Dallas to Bogota via San Francisco. None of the second row seats in the business cabin reclined.  There was a partition right behind the second row so there was no way to recline the seats. AA should inform customers ahead of time if a whole row of seats do not recline. This ticket, business class on an international flight of almost 6 hours, was significantly more expensive. You are paying a bunch of money and you can't even stretch your legs."
207,"Not Verified |  Pittsburgh to Phoenix. Terribly dissatisfied about the manner in which they regard services for the handicapped. We indicated when we purchased out tickets to a funeral we were attending that we would need a wheelchair for my wife. Upon arrival to our destination back home to Phoenix there were no attendants with a wheelchair for not just my wife, but for other handicapped passengers. My wife hobbled the best she could as she held onto the sides of the ramp leading from the plane to the gate. I had both of our carry on suitcases to manage with as well as my backpack and my wife's purse. When we got to the gate to inquire about the wheelchair, the attendants at the gate said they did not know why no one showed up with wheelchairs and had been calling down to the area where the AA wheelchairs are stationed to no avail. Some attendant who was walking around upset and furious scanned my wife's boarding pass and the other handicapped passengers, asking us to be patient and someone would be arriving shortly. Well, after we all complained again, 15 minutes later 2 people showed up but we all could tell they were not sure what they were supposed to do or where they were supposed to go (almost like they were new hires and that was their first day). We had no checked luggage so all we needed to do was to be taken straight to the parking garage to the valet area. My wife, who suffers from (peripheral artery disease) was in great discomfort from the whole ordeal and was in tears. I felt helpless, no one knew why the wheelchairs were not showing up, total mismanagement and disregard for handicapped travelers."
208,"  Los Angeles to Miami. By far one of the worse Airlines in the US. The Customer service reps are rude and give you constant attitude. I have the AAdvantage credit card and part of the perks is that my first check in bag as well as the person flying with me in the same flight is free. I booked two tickets from Los Angeles to Miami for me and my cousin. Used miles for one and paid the other one only to find out that my cousin has to pay for his bag because they put him on a different record locator because I am using miles for my flight. Called Customer service and the agent was rude and with attitude not willing to help or do anything to fix this repeating again that you are on two different record locators (we know by now) asked to speak to her manager, even worse!!! Will cancel my credit card with American and never fly with you guys again."
209, Charlotte to Providence. Missed our flight by 10 minutes due to car trouble. The airline worked with me to schedule us on the next available flight at no extra charge. They were kind and courteous which I greatly appreciated.
210,  Philadelphia to Seattle. I will never fly American again. My husband and I bought our tickets together do you think we are sitting together definitely not because that would only be smart. Several other couples had this same problem and when we voiced this problem they said the only way to sit together was to spend more money. I've flown both delta and Alaska multiple times and never had this problem. This is the second time I have flown American and I have had this problem both times. Also there seats are uncomfortable and no in-flight entertainment. Thanks for being as basic as possible American airline
211,"  Atlanta to Dallas. Terrible, 4 times they changed my flight time, and twice they changed it back to the original time. They are very inept and unorganized. Please, pick a different airline."
212,"Not Verified |  Denver to Chicago. I have had the worst experience with American Airlines. My partner and I had flights booked for thanksgiving travel. My partner has recently been relocated for his job and this requires us to move across the country. Therefore we are unable to Travel at thanksgiving. We have had to cancel two other flights so far. Spirit and united have both made exceptions and allowed for us to cancel our flights with a no cancellation fee. This was very generous on their part and we appreciate our experiences with them. American Airlines has refused to help us out in any way. The will not refund or even give flight credit. I found every representative to be very rude and not accommodating. I’m very disappointed with our experience and I do not intend to fly with their airline ever again. As someone who works in customer service, I am aware you are able to pull strings and make exceptions. I do it for our customer everyday, as we value their loyalty to our company. I hope American Airlines can provide better service to other customers in the future."
213," Springfield to Dallas Ft. Worth via Las Vegas with American Airlines. I would stay away from this airline unless you enjoy sitting around waiting for explanations on why your 1am flight has been delayed 3 hours until 4 am. If you have a connection flight I would find a different airline unless you want to miss that connection. Constantly overbooked, and never fly out on time. Terrible airline. Pretty easy to tell the company does not care about its employees or customers."
214,"Not Verified |  St. Louis to Jackson. This is a horrible airline and I do not recommend anyone to fly with American Airlines. They cancelled my flight two hours before take off and have not made any accommodations for my inconvenience. Their employees lack empathy, professionalism and has bad customer service when dealing with customers. "
215,"  
I purchased my ticket weeks before my departure. AA frequently changed the flight times, thus making it difficult to make plans. When I arrived at LAX early to catch the flight to Phoenix, I discovered the departure time had been changed yet again, from 10am to 2pm. It departed after 2pm, although it arrived Phoenix nearly on time. The departure from Phoenix to Austin was late, as was the arrival in Austin. After our arrival in Austin, the ground crew was late in putting in the gate, and so we waited, waited to deplane. I am not happy with this service. LA to Phoenix on Oct. 10, AA Flight 0445 Phoenix to Austin on Oct. 10, AA Flight 0889."
216," Delayed 3 times for morning flight that caused me to miss boarding my connecting flight that was the next gate over, watched my suitcase get put on the plane though. Now after sitting for over 3 hours for next flight, they have delayed that one 5 times! First and last time I'll fly with American Airlines."
217," Dallas to Lafayette. Absolute worst customer care of any airline I fly. I fly 3 times a week. They can't control weather so flights get canceled. They have one agent covering 9 gates of canceled flights and he's a trainee . There is no sense of urgency, no concern at all. Another agent arrived with a friend who was flirting with her right in front of a line of 30 people needing prompt help. She casually logged in then called someone to bring her a radio she forgot somewhere. Then starred at the screen like the guy so not to make eye contact. Gate B5 and B6 counter at DFW on October 10 which made the experience go through midnight to Oct 11. Now 1 am Oct 11. Still no help. Horrible"
218,"  Salt Lake City to Dallas. The weakest airline I have ever taken.  No entertainment, no carry-on overhead space forced to check-in the carry-on as baggage ""complimentary"", no food and drink, uncomfortable seats. Just several announcements from the cabin crew to apply for a credit card with 15000 miles with an annual fee $99.99!"
219,Not Verified |  Lubbock to Charlotte. Going to visit my sister and my usual airline does not fly directly to her home town so grabbed a flight with American Airlines and boy did I learn a lesson. I will never fly with these money grabbers again. I did not realize after flying so long with a better company that buying my ticket did not guarantee that I would be flying with my wife. For 6 flights the closest we sat to each other was two rows apart. You can call me cheap but sorry that I paid for a plane ticket assuming things then refused to pay $50 a ticket extra during check in to try to get seats together.
220," Atlanta to Dallas. American Airlines runs out of overhead baggage space by the boarding of group 4 on any full flight. It increases boarding times and departure time. At this point after instituting baggage fees, they should have enough historical data to implement proactive change to improve onboard baggage policies. Which leads to the 2 on-plane bags policy, which disproportionately impacts women business travelers. As a female traveler, this negatively impacts the needs of female travelers. A male just boarded with a laptop bag, roll-on bag, and shopping bag. A female was stopped and required to “combine down” for a smaller cross-body bag with her laptop, and roll-on bag. Zero-tolerance or full enforcement should apply."
221,  I was flying to Jacksonville North Carolina. I accidentally purchased tickets to Jacksonville Florida. Notice the different states. Yes I know this is my fault however I am human and it was an accident. The first leg of my journey was with Delta. When we arrived in Atlanta and realized we were headed to Florida accidentally Delta took care of us and sent us to Jacksonville North Carolina as I had originally planned. When I called and attempted to change my American Airlines ticket they refused. They refused to make an exception. Very poor customer service and they did not care. They refused to even entertain switching the ticket. I was willing to pay a fee to change it.
222,"  Indianapolis to Phoenix. I will never fly on American Airlines again. Their customer service is the absolute worst I have ever encountered and there is no way to talk with anyone on the phone. Despite the fact that there is a ""customer service"" telephone number listed, I have called it four times and each time I waited over 30 minutes to be connected to discuss my issues only to be told ""this is reservations and we are a totally different department, if you want customer service you can send an email, that is the only way to contact them."" On one of these occasions (after waiting 40 minutes, I couldn't understand the person when they said their name. I asked him to repeat it, still didn't understand him so I spelled what I though he was saying and he hung up on me! This forced me to call back again and wait ANOTHER 40 minutes. In the end I emailed them and someone finally called me back but when I asked to speak to their supervisor because I was not happy with the resolution or her ability to explain the situation (more about this later) she stated ""our supervisors don't speak to customers"". The whole issue was a mechanical problem that caused me and the two people I was traveling with to miss our connection and be delayed an entire day (I understand problems happen and that is not the issue) my two traveling companions filed claims for a refund as did I. they both received vouchers for another flight but I did not. When the customer service agent (who I cannot call on the phone) called me she explained that because I have an AAdvantage Account they were giving me 10,000 miles or I could also receive a voucher. So I asked ""what is the value of the 10,000 miles versus the $175 voucher my companions received?"" She said she couldn't tell me but I could call the AAdvantage program and ask them and I said ""but if I do that how will I reach you again to tell you which I want?"" She answered that I could submit another email request (which requires phone number, email, flight number and record locator to all be submitted again and wait for them to call me. I told her how ridiculous this was and this is when I asked for the supervisor. In the end I told her to just give me the miles but it didn't really matter because I will never fly American Airlines again."
223,"  Worst airline customer service. They simply don’t care! Delayed by 5 hours. Happens, right! But such a lack of communication the entire time. Every single employee seemed annoyed at the questions. Then they boarded us and we sat on the tarmac for another hour! Weak apologies and planning! I will take 2 segments with another airline to avoid American in the future. And I travel for business 3 weeks a month."
224," Dallas to Reno. How does a standby ticket get a better seat than a paid ticket and is loaded in group 3 with a carry on bag instead of 9 made to check the carry on like I had to? I had to wait until five minutes before boarding to getting my seat assignment when a standby person got a seat assignment 10 mins before I did. The counter agent told me it is a full flight and had to check my bag. When we were loaded, there were several empty seats, so much for the full flight. Now I have to wait in baggage claim when I get to Reno. I can see why American Airlines has such low reviews. Whether I buy a first-class or economy one I should be treated as a paying seat ticket price customer. I'm very disappointed with the service."
225," Tampa to Miami. This was probably the best 36-minute flight ever. The plane felt and looked brand new, legroom was great, the seat was very comfortable, the large entertainment screen was unexpected but very much appreciated, they gave me a drink and a snack. The crew at the counter and the gate were very friendly, I wish I could say the same for the first-class flight attendant that never smiled at all however was efficient in his duties. Maybe he had a rough morning. Over all, Good job AA!"
226,"  New York to Chicago. I was worried after booking American for the first time in a decade after reading a lot of poor reviews, but they offered good prices and itineraries for flights from JFK to ORD. However, I felt compelled to leave a review based on my pleasant experience that completely exceeded expectations. There were no bells or whistles to this flight, but the small fee to sit in Main Cabin Extra was well worth it, as I am 5'4 and could stretch my legs out almost completely without hitting the seat ahead. The cabin staff was friendly, pilots upbeat, and the aircraft was actually pretty modern and clean. Bad things I expected based on popular reviews of American Airlines but did not experience: - outdated aircraft interior - delays & cancellations - gate changes - unfriendly crew - tight pitch Things that could be improved: - cheesy smell of the breakfast offered to first-class passengers permeated the cabin and was quite nauseating - had to explicitly ask for the alcohol perks for Main Cabin Extra passengers and wasn't originally offered - rougher takeoffs and landings than any other airline I've flown (felt very rushed on both actually) - no inflight entertainment if you don't have the app on your phone Overall, this was a good flight at a great price point and I would definitely fly American Airlines again for short-hauls."
227,"Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Dallas. Two hour delay sitting on the plane due to air not working. Staff is rude and not helpful. They keep telling us 15 more minutes and we are clearly nowhere close to departure. There have been 7 delays since I have been sitting here. The air is still not working, all the passengers are sweating, and very uncomfortable. I have never had a more horrible flight experience in my life. I will never fly this airline again."
228,"Not Verified |  Tampa to Wilkes Barre with American Airlines. This airline takes no accountability for errors that occur on their end. A death in my family occurred and a change of flight had to be made. I called over 24 hours before the flight was scheduled for and paid $32.00 to reschedule my flight for the next day. I was advised to use the same flight locator/confirmation code and check into my flight and when I attempted to was met with a completely useless ticket representative with no record on the part of American Airlines and was advised my only option was to purchase another $285 ticket! Though I had credit card receipts showing we had paid to change the flight. Worst experience I’ve ever had flying. As a frequent flyer with family across multiple states, myself and family will never fly American Airlines again and recommend anyone considering a trip to do the same!"
229,Not Verified |  Second time flying American Airlines and it's completely screwed up again. Two hour delay due to plane being in hanger and no one to bringing it over. Missed first flight. Also missed second flight out of Charlotte due to delay. Now sitting in airport for another seven hours getting into Erie at 10.20 Monday evening. Keep in mind we left Fresno at 11.30 pm Sunday night. They changed our flights from Dallas to Charlotte and we didn't want to sit in airport for seven hours so we changed flights for a fee and here we are sitting on Charlotte NC for seven hours. Worst airline ever. They gave us free flights for next year because in July they cancelled our flight for no reason and I don't even want to use them because the airlines are such a mess. They ruin the end of every great vacation and we're sick of it. The incompetence of this airline is beyond comprehension.
230,Not Verified |  Phoenix to Spokane. It is very sad that a company as pathetic as American Airlines can be up and running still with their consistent inability to satisfy even the simplest of needs (including landing within 2 hours of your scheduled time) on an overpriced ticket. I must give props to the staff however because despite the horrible system they still manage to impress with their astonishing amount of rudeness and lack of basic customer service skills.
231,"Not Verified | Washington to Pensacola. We were exhausted after a stay in DC and had to fly back to Pensacola on a 7:30p flight as we have done many times. My husband and I recently married and upon entering the plane jokingly asked, ""we're newlyweds can we sit in first class?"" The flight attendant was genuinely so kind and congratulated us (along with her fellow flight attendant. That was one of the most fabulous flights we've had in a while. Not just because we were able to fly first class (as we've flown several times), but the flight attendants dispositions and the ""on-time"", early arrival and smooth flight itself was all first class! In a time where posting negative reviews (myself included) are everywhere, I just wanted to take a minute and thank the flight attendants for her exemplary, genuinely positive and caring attitude she displayed to myself, my husband and others on that flight."
232," I normally fly Southwest but they don’t fly into Burlington, VT so we bought tickets for a vacation through American Airlines. Overall, the experience left a lot to be desired. We had one layover both ways. Our first layover was in Chicago where we experienced a 4hr delay. The AA employees told the waiting passengers that two crew members were delayed and they were on their way. Every 15-30min, I would receive a text stating the flight had been delayed another 30min but very little communication from the counter and absolutely no apologies. Once aboard the plane, we were told by the pilot that due to another plane delay AA had to get new pilots and that was the reason for the delay. After sitting for several minutes, the pilot came back on to say that due to the delay, the flight pattern had been cancelled. So, there we sat in a stuffy, small airplane for another hour. Do you suppose the powers at be might have known this would happen and allow passengers to wait in the comfort of the airport at least. I am guessing they needed to get the plane off the loading gate. While sitting on the tarmac, I wrote an email to AA Customer Service in the hopes they would extend an olive branch of service recovery on our return flights (a free drink ticket, upgraded seats, maybe earlier boarding). I am in the service industry as well and know how much it means to offer a small gesture as an apology when things go wrong. No one is perfect after all. Someone did email me back, but offered vouchers for my next flight. I responded saying that I was really hoping for something on my return flight since I wasn’t sure I would be flying AA again. The staff member did respond stating that she was sorry I wasn’t happy with what was offered, but AA could not be offering anything else. So AA would rather coerce me into flying with them again with two $50 vouchers instead of providing some service recovery upfront via a couple free drinks or an upgraded boarding status which would have gone a lot further. It is no wonder this airlines falls below Southwest, Delta, JetBlue and others in customer satisfaction. I won’t fly with American again as I do not believe they truly value their customers. I will end by saying the AA counter staff at the Burlington Airport were lovely and very friendly. But the staff at Chicago O’Hare and Philadelphia seem to dislike their jobs or the customers they are there to serve. Or maybe the employees are treated like the customers with little regard to showing care and compassion."
233," Abhorrent customer service. Delayed out of Knoxville for no apparent reason. Watched in Charlotte airport for 15 minutes before gangway detached from airplane that was supposed to go to Pittsburgh. Forced to stay in Charlotte but no compensation made for hotel or transportation citing “policy”. Rude, uncaring customer assistance. Manager not empowered to address anything and was uncaring and obstinate. Similar experience same evening for my wife but she was flying Delta - they took care of their customer. Simply put don't fly American Airlines. "
234,"Not Verified | I was supposed to fly from Toronto to New York today, and then to Boston. After getting on the plane and sitting on the runway, we were told there was an issue with the plane. These things happen, there is no point in freaking out. As the day progressed I became more and more disappointed with American Airlines staff. They rudely told me I was going to have to go to Chicago to get to Boston. As I boarded my plane to Chicago, I was harassed for having a large carry-on bag and not having a proper ticket yet (because the airline didn't give me one after switching me). I was told to give my carry-on bag over to them. I don't have any issues with the logic of needing space in the cabin, but the rude way the staff demanded it was shameful. I was lied to and told that I could get it back in Chicago When I arrived in Chicago, I asked where I could get my carry-on bag. A different staff member rudely told me I will get it in Boston. When I tried to explain that there was some sort of miscommunication, I was told that I am just a poor listener. Finally, It was time to go to Boston, I was called to the stand to get a seat number, when I went up I was asked in a very aggressive voice ""why are you up here right now"". I explained that I was called and she said: ""I did not call anyone, sit down"". The other employee had to intervene and remind the lady that she had called me. I really am never someone to complain or to write negative reviews. I was just so blown away by how poorly American Airlines handled everything today that I felt something needed to be said."
235,Not Verified | Myrtle Beach to Appleton. Flight was suppose to leave at 5:45 am we arrived at the airport at 5:07 which was empty at the moment. Checking in our bags we were told the fight was booked and ready for take off. Said we came too late. So after waiting for the next flight and having a layover of 6 hrs in Chicago. We are told it was our fault for not being there at least 30 min early. Simple math 5:07 to 5:45 is 38 minutes. Flight left with 6 open seats. Never using American Airlines again. Customer service was rude and short. Will be delta from here on out
236," On my flight from Dallas to Las Vegas (3 Sep), I accidentally left my small pocket Bible in the seatback pocket. I realized it the next day and when I returned to the airport for my flight home, I checked Lost & Found to no avail. At that point, I figured it was gone. I have had that Bible with me twice in Afghanistan and many other places and was sorry to lose it. But when I got to my office the following week, I had a phone message from an American Airlines employee who had found my Bible in Buffalo, NY, and had managed to track me down. She kindly offered to mail it back to me and I received it a few days later, as good as new. She truly went the extra mile for me which I so greatly appreciated and will long remember."
237,"  I been flying all my life, I respect and understand that things just happen. Not this case with the most awful and abusive use of the word American. There is nothing American about how this airline purposely abuses the power when selling tickets for flights that obviously can’t provide. Once you are in the air on one of their flights you are definitely going to have your connecting flight canceled. It has happened to me of a family member every month the last four months when one of us have taken a flight. The pattern exists. Only to add injury to insult the will give you a $12 food voucher (airport food prices) as if that will remedy the abuse. There has to be a way to hold them accountable to the point to where they respect and show remorse when it comes the consumer. Nevertheless I will never fly with them again. You can’t put a price on time and disrespect. They don’t have planes, they sell flights they can not honor and the staff has to be well aware."
238,Not Verified | St Louis to Chicago. American Airlines is the worst. They made half the flight check their carry-ons when there was plenty of room for more bags. The plane was trashed. When the pilot came on to make announcements it they made loud screeching noises the entire time. Did they stop and try to fix that? You guessed it. No. This airline clearly gives zero cares about their customers. Fly anyone but American. There are always multiple issues with AA!
239," Lihue to Los Angeles. Our flight was delayed overnight. We didn't get any reimbursement for stay, food, transportation, etc. American Airlines just ignored us. I would never use this airline again!"
240,"  I booked in advance a flight with 1 stop from Newark to Tulsa. I needed to change some dates at considerable expense.Through Travelocity, the airline issued a $174 credit (only valid from one year of booking). I wanted to book another flight 12 days later than the expiration date. Even though we did not take our Tulsa flight until April of 2019, the airline said I could not redeem my credit in Feb. 2020 because my booking was in earlier Feb. of 2019. Travelocity tried to advocate for us and I called American Airlines myself. I spoke with Dane, and she stated the airline would not extend my credit. This is the price you pay for booking a flight early! I plan to retire in 2 years and do a lot of traveling, but you can bet I will never book with American Airlines! "
241," Dallas to Madison. What a circus! The flight was delayed from 10:30 am until now - still sitting in the airport at 4:45 pm and they are “hoping” our new plane will be authorized to fly by 5:30. These clowns had us on the plane and partially towed to the runway when one bolt stripped on the part that hooks to the tow vehicle. We eventually deplaned and then waited at least two hours for maintenance to look at the stripped bolt. Fast forward to now and apparently, they don’t have any bolts on hand so they are supposedly bringing us a new plane, at a new gate, but we have yet to see it. Oh, and to add insult to injury, they gave us all a $12 meal voucher for our troubles. That works out to around $2 per hour for our wasted time. Thanks, American! I will be sure to never fly with you again. Oh, let me add that in the short time I was actually on the plane, I looked around to see if it was a full flight (which they always are) as I was smashed between two large dudes. I noticed the two female flight attendants sitting in the back row which was completely empty, save for themselves. I caught the eye of one and mouthed “are those seats open” which they obviously were. She looked at me, glanced at the open seats and looked back and shook her head “nope”! Thanks! I wouldn’t want to intrude on your private flight attendant conversation. Please enjoy the six seats the two of you are occupying."
242,"  Seattle to Paris via Dallas. First and last time we ever fly American Airlines. Both flights to and from our destination were delayed. The first flight was delayed “due to weather”, which is ridiculous because the weather was actually fine, the bad weather happened the day before. When we discovered this we told it to the employees and they said they were still catching up, though ALL other airlines were already flying on time. Because of “bad weather,” AA stated they were not responsible for any incurred expenses to us from the delay. We had to stay overnight in Dallas, had to pay for our own hotel, got no reimbursement or even a small upgrade on our next flight. Not even offering us a complimentary drink or anything. Customer service is horrible. On the flight back, there was also a delay and this time NO explanation was offered but they rerouted us which added a 5 hr layover and a longer connecting flight. Overall we lost a whole day on our already short trip to Europe, lost hundreds of dollars from having to pay for a hotel in Dallas and missing a day in our prepaid accommodation in Europe. The trip was exhausting and stressful. Save yourselves and do not fly American Airlines."
243,"  Bangor to Albany via Philadelphia. I arrived at Gate 4 at Bangor ME to depart for Philly at 5:10 where I was greeted by 2 people, a female standing at the counter, and a tall gentleman, who had both seen me scurrying toward them after a delay at security in this small airport. When I arrived at the counter the man moved to the open doorway/tunnel to the plane and stated ""you need to stay back"" . I am 58 years of age, 5'5"", 108 pounds. He was very tall and sounded quite aggressive. The female then stated that I would not be permitted to board. I asked her why and she stated ""You had to be here at 5:10"". I looked at my phone and stated ""it is 5:10 (I show her my phone) and I checked in online as well. She then stated ""NO, it's 5:11, I have been watching my clock. The gate to the plane was still open, the tunnel in place, and the plane had not left the ground. I explained that I am a caregiver to my ill husband and this is simply not possible as I was checked in online and had arrived within the time limit. She stated, and I quote ""no, and my boss was here to see it"" (my 5:11 am arrival, she watched her clock!) I was on stand-by and able to leave Bangor at 5:45 a.m. but what ensued, a nightmare. Redirected from Wash/DC to Philly/PA and from Philly to Alb, NY., no flight until 3:30 p.m.I sobbed at the counter, and in panic, searched for an earlier flight from my phone only to find that I could buy a seat from this very same airline on an 11:30 instead of 3:00 p.m. I returned, again went through security, and found someone to help me change the ticket to the 11:30. What happened with American Airlines at Bangor, ME International Airport was despicable. They held me up at the counter waiting for the clock to strike 5:11, which, I surmise, is due to having given my seat away. It created a day of absolute hell for me and my family. Thanks American."
244,"  Absolutely horrible service! Many delays and the flight attendants were too busy talking about the airline and how they where they paid and the flight they were scheduled for sucked. This was my second time flying with them as this happened many years ago also. Due to needing a quick flight for a medical emergency and the time that had past since I last flew with them, I figured I’d give them another try - worst mistake I made, and never again!"
245, Charlotte to Cleveland. Boarded at 5:10 PM; it is now 6:55pm. Departure time has changed 4 times; we are told the pilots were not scheduled: and now the paperwork is not legal. Still sitting and waiting.
246,"Not Verified | Greensboro to Wichita. Terrible, absolutely horrible! My brother is a 30-year pilot with this Airlines. That is why I decided to go with it. I have flown with Delta, United even TWA back in the old days and Braniff Airlines. I have never seen an airline change their flight status so many times. Not only did they cancel a flight on me. But they continued to screw around and caused me a great deal of hardship over it was supposed to be just a simple flight from Greensboro to Wichita. They also have cost me over 27 hours due to the canceled flight in Wichita last night. I have been waiting to go back home now 27 hours to Greensboro. I could have taken an Amtrak train and gotten there quicker. My wife it's a first-time flyer. She is totally bombed with flying now! Rightfully so American Airlines really jerking people around. They also owe me two days parking now that I left my car at the airport - that's another $16 plus the $ 40 I spent on food unnecessarily while waiting on my flights. Do yourself a favor - drive or take Amtrak."
247,Not Verified | Austin to Charleston via Charlotte. Worst airline I have ever seen. Travel time 40 mins and they took 1 hour to find the gate. After going on to the runway they mentioned 2 checkups no been done and after an hour they said one engine is not working. Overall worst experience. Don’t ever fly with American Airlines
248,  Charlotte to Dallas. I was boarding the plane and the lady in the front told me I needed to make sure my luggage fit. So I did that. Of course it dint because no luggage fits on that thing. So they told me they had to take my bag I said it fit on the last plane and that was a small plane so I asked the lady is it a small plane? She said it was - that was a lie it was a big plane which I knew so I said well I want to try it. I then continued to argue with the person who said that since they had already printed out a ticket for my luggage that it had to go (that’s not my problem) so then i was made to leave my luggage. My question now is why does American make me have to check my luggage when all the other ones where my same size and they just don’t have enough head bin space at the top to allow more bags so of course instead of telling you that they would rather lie and come up with an excuse as to why I can’t bring my luggage in.
249,"Not Verified |  American is by far the worst airline I have ever flown. First $30 to check 1 bag. Then I paid a total of $66 dollars to upgrade my seats. Then the airplane is here on time at 2.30pm in Tampa but the crew is not. So I will miss my connecting in Dallas because now they won't leave for another 2 hrs. So now leaving for Philly but not for another 4 hrs. So flight doesnt leave Philly until 9pm, should arrive into Phoenix now at 11.30pm. Just a complete poor show and guess what, on both flights I'm in the very back in the middle. They won't refund for money spent already to upgrade seats. This will be the last time this airline screws me."
250,Not Verified |  Tampa to Charlotte via Pittsburgh with American Airlines. Flight has been delayed 9 times (so far). We've had to change our connecting flight twice which has put us back 5 hours. No apology or explanation and the staff is rude. They dont care about customers. We are currently still stuck at the airport. I will never fly American Airlines again.
251,"Not Verified | Dallas to Louisville. Worst airline company for wanting to make it anywhere on time. They have delayed both flights, waited 5 mins before flight was to board to let anyone know and then say it’s a 2hr delay. How can you not know something that big of a delay ahead of time? I have none of my luggage because the last flight was full so I had to check it in. Now I’m without"
252,"  Charlotte to Birmingham. Delayed, delayed, delayed. Hate this airline. Will never use them ever again. They have no scheduling management and can not keep a simple flight schedule on time."
253,"Not Verified |  Amarillo to Dallas. American is terrible. Two (2) flights delayed 2+ hours each; a short flight on Monday and return flight on Wednesday. Both were delayed due to maintenance issues. Thankfully, I had text alerts on the first flight since no one was at the counter to ask what was going on, just kept being pushed back and back and back via text message. There are only 6 gates at the entire airport so if I wanted to talk to an American Airlines employee, I would have to leave gate area to front desks and check back in through security. Luckily, I wasn't needing to make a connecting flight. A 55 minute flight turned into an almost 5 hour debacle. American makes driving to Dallas a viable option rather than flying with them. I will check every other carrier before I ever book with American again."
254,"  Portland to Charlotte. American kept passengers on the plane for two hours while they “looked” for a mechanic to check one of the struts. Passengers were told multiple stories about what was going on, each time delaying us further from making other flying arrangements. Flight personnel were busy on their phones not attending to passengers or offering water or any accommodation. Once we were told to change plans at 12:10am, we had limited communication with the flight attendants. At about 2:30am we hit the worst turbulence I have ever encountered- obviously this is not the airline’s doing, but when I started shivering and became ill I went to the back of the plane and asked an attendant (who was busy watching a movie on their iPad) for a blanket and a bag because I thought I might become sick. She told me that blankets were reserved for first class customers and that she needed the blanket on her lap because it was cold at the back of the plane. She then looked for a bag and handed me a warm bottle of water. We finally arrived in Charlotte, NC but those of us who had connecting flights had zero support from staff to communicate with the other airlines or even their own flights. I have found American to be one of the worst airlines I have ever flown. They should be ashamed."
255,"  Madrid to Boston. We were transferred to this airline after BA had a strike. The service and flight were fabulous. Food and drink very very good. But what really stood out was the lovely crew attendants, the best ever."
256," This is the worst airline I've ever flown. Time and time again, I miss my connecting flights because every single flight is always delayed. As a broke college student, I had a job interview scheduled for the day after I fly in, missed my connection by 8 minutes while sprinting through the airport because it took the plane 26 minutes to connect to the terminal after the initial flight was delayed. There's a real potential that I won't get this full-time job because American Airlines is the absolute worst. Thanks for potentially putting my future at jeopardy!"
257," Tucson to Honolulu via Phoenix. Timeline of events: On August 22, 2019, I left TUS for PHX at 1146a. At 1025a, received an AA text message advising my 225p PHX/HNL departure was on time. At 1230p, received another AA text message advising my 225p PHX/HNL departure was on time. At 103p, received an AA text message that my 225p departure was delayed to 254p. Approximately 130p, we were told by the PHX gate agent that our flight was delayed - a bit overdue since we already knew this from our text messages. She anticipated the delay being about an hour. At 328p, received an AA text message that the HNL flight was delayed until 425p. At 344p, received an AA text message that the HNL flight was delayed until 425p. At 427p, received an AA text message that the HNL flight was delayed until 530p. At 5p, received an AA text message that the HNL flight was delayed until 6p. This was only the second time we heard from when the gate agent advised this was a mechanical delay and it would be a further delay. They were getting a part for the plane. At 532p, received an AA text message that the HNL flight was delayed until 630p. At 543p, received an AA text message that the HNL flight was delayed until 830p. At 558p received an AA text message that there was a gate change for our HNL flight. At 637p, received an AA text message that the HNL flight was delayed until 9p. At 640p, received an AA text message that there was another gate change for our HNL flight. At 735p, received an AA text message that the HNL flight was delayed until 931p. At 751p, received an AA text message that the HNL flight was cancelled! At 755p, the gate agent announced the flight was cancelled and advised us to go to the Customer Service counter and handed us a “Let’s get you back on track” card. After standing in line, with Customer Service, I was given two vouchers one $12 food voucher and one hotel voucher, for the Hampton Inn. They also rebooked me on a Hawaiian Air flight, leaving the next morning, August 23, at 8a. The events of August 22 certainly could have been handled better. We barely heard from a person on all these delays but text messages were almost every 30 minutes, but no updates from AA employees. When I asked (as well as other travelers on the same flight) the gate agents for updates, they just said they knew nothing. I tried to use my “meal” voucher twice, with no luck! Both McDonalds and coffee kiosk told me they did not take the meal voucher, so this went unused. When I called my hotel in HNL, they were able to hold my reservation, but I would have to still pay for Thursday evening. After over 9 hours in the PHX airport, I finally just went to the hotel, grabbed a bag of chips and fell asleep. When I asked American Airline to reimburse me for my missed night in Hawaii, which I had to still pay for, they advised they were 'fair and reasonable' in providing the hotel accommodations in Phoenix and then got me to Hawaii the next day. Definitely no longer 'something special in the air'!"
258,"Not Verified |  Charlotte to Lexington. First of all when my flight landed in Charlotte, NC we sat on the runway for 45 minutes before we could get off, then had to go through the slowest customs lines and missed my flight home. This isn't the first time that has happened. I wouldn't recommend anyone to fly to Charlotte, NC if you want to get home at a decent time and not have to miss flights and end up sitting in the airport 4 to 5 hours waiting on another flight.  American airlines need to get their schedules together so you won't miss your connecting flight. American airlines knows the process of going through customs and shouldn't have planes scheduled to take off so fast before you can get through customs. People's time is valuable and don't want to spend a whole day trying to get back home"
259,Not Verified |  Salt Lake City to Dallas. Horrible. I caught an earlier flight planning on catching the flight back. They cancelled both. Even though I called before. So I had to rebook the same flight for $500. When I called in to fix it after talking to the supervisor he said he would check something then put me on hold for 20 minutes just because he could. I fly this route with them monthly. Will be Delta from now on.
260,Not Verified |  Seattle to Atlanta. Wasn’t pleased with this flight. We had a layover in Charlotte. Then from there went to Seattle. On this flight there was no tv. The snacks were limited to just cookies and you had to pay for additional food. If a flight is 5-6hrs I think the expectation is that there should be entertainment and a few snack options. In addition at the end of the flight we had to catch a shuttle to the airport. Mind you this is a 10pm Landing. The plane smelled and my husband and I didn’t enjoy the experience.
261,"  
Tonight’s lack of customer service is despicable. My boyfriend and I flew home from Alaska and had different middle flights from Seattle to DFW. His plane was late departing making his already close call to near impossible. The plane then landed with 20 minutes to spare before our gate closed and there was no gate available for them to dock the plane so they stayed landed and unable to get off the plane for 30 minutes. Management refused multiple times to hold the flight for the 15 American Airlines who were stuck on that plane due to their error and unable to make the last flight to Jacksonville for today. 15 passengers are now stuck in Dallas because they refused to delay the departure of 1 flight to give good customer service to customers who were delayed due to their error. To top it off .. they will not even provide hotel to those they have screwed. They now have to wait in DFW for the next flight out tomorrow morning at 7:20.  Shame on you, American Airlines. I will never fly with you again and I’ll do everything I can to make sure others don’t also. "
262,"  Orlando to Dallas. American Airlines staff are great, however, their company runs a terrible business. For my honeymoon, my wife and I took 4 American flights which we booked together. The airline separated us for 3/4 flights and even with checking in 24 hours in advance there was no unpaid option for seats together. The airline was trying to force us to pay for an upgrade to get seats together. The American Airlines front desk admitted this is what they are doing, but could not help us. I have flown on over 12 different airlines and American is the only one to treat me this badly."
263,Not Verified | Phoenix to New Bern. This is the 3rd flight this year that has been delayed over and over. Worst airline ever. If Southwest flew here I certainly wouldn't be flying American. My last flight I spent half the night in Boston trying to get home. Always the same thing they don't have a plane. Get it together AA.
264,"  Flight from CLT to CLE booked through American - they suggested this connection at Reagan. The flight from Charlotte to Reagan sat on the tarmac waiting to take off for at least 20-30 minutes. I asked the flight attendant when we would make it in and whether I would make my connection. He said “yes! You will have plenty of time to connect. The flight is only an hour.” I finally get off the plane in terminal B and check the monitors to make sure I have the right gate for my connection (35X). There is one very small sign that says you have to take a shuttle to get to terminal C/X. I almost exited the airport because I passed it. Now, I don’t travel every once in awhile - I travel for business 2 out of 4 weeks a month. Get to the shuttle gate and the bus just leaves. I walk over to the closest gate and ask the attendant if she could help make sure the flight doesn’t leave without me. She says she can’t help and they always leave on time. I finally get down to my gate at 4:49! I looked at my watch as soon as they said the flight was closed. My flight was scheduled to depart at 4:59. I was there ten minutes before the flight was to depart - I should have been permitted on the flight. The staff at the gate were not helpful nor apologetic. If someone would have just said “sorry for the inconvenience” I don’t think I would be so upset - but nothing! I work in retail - I know things go wrong, mistakes happen ... but if one of my customers was inconvenienced with my product - even if it wasn’t my fault particularly, I still apologize. American has definitely lost a customer and I plan to spread the word."
265,"  Our flight from Charlotte to Des Moines was okay, but a little frustrating. Very friendly staff at ticket counter, at gate and on the flight. We were able to board early with our infant and get settled. Waiting on the tarmac for 45 minutes before take off was not ideal. We technically still made it to Iowa on time so that means the 45 minutes wait time was built into the flight. If that's the case, state that so I can book with someone else. The plane was small. My husband and I are not small in width so trying to juggle an infant and having to pump, we were miserable. The Des Moines to Charlotte flight was not a pleasant experience. The lady at the ticket counter was great as well as staff on the flight. The lady at the gate was awful. Very rude. They boarded a handicapped lady so my husband and I head up to board early with our infant and was told ""you are in group 7 and it is not your turn. We do not allow families to board early. You'll have to wait"". No ""I'm sorry"" or anything and with a snarky voice like we should have known this. I have never been on a flight were families weren't allowed to board first. So trying to walk down the aisle with our bags and an infant, bumping into other passengers and disturbing them was not okay. This needs to be addressed."
266,"Not Verified | Chicago to London. I flew to London with American Airlines and it was a comfortable flight. The staff were sweet and helpful. They always checked on everyone, making sure everyone was happy and taken care of. The flight was smooth and quick. The inflight movies and WiFi made the flight so much more comfortable and quick. I will be flying American again."
267,"Not Verified | Gulfport to Portland via Phoenix. 6:10 am flight cancelled late night. Changes to an earlier departure with a lengthy connection. They could care less. Missed business appointments and left with a middle seat. Will do everything possible to never fly this airline again. Beyond anything, I could imagine. The worst. No empathy no offer for assistance. A “whatever” attitude. There are options"
268,"Not Verified |  My flight was returning at 9.00 pm from Philadelphia to St Louis last night. I upgraded my seat to be closer to the front of the plane to not get stuck near the bathroom where I was. This cost me $21 which I chose to do willingly at check in. When I boarded the plane it was a 6 seat across aircraft but I don't remember the model. It was mostly empty so when I saw how empty it was I asked if I could move anywhere I wanted to and the Stewardess said anywhere but the emergency exit seats or first class. I get the first class thing but the emergency exit seats? Seems like they'd want someone there to handle the doors for emergency purposes but she said they are premium seats and its against the rules. I think I could do a good job with the seats since I am 6'2"" 210 lbs former Marine in shape. She did a good job and was very pleasant so I don't fault her. American Airlines has a silly policy is all I think. All those emergency exit seats were empty so there was nobody there to man the exits. Seems dumb. Like a governmental bureaucratic policy deal. Everything else on the flight was fine."
269, Dallas to Corpus Christi. Worst customer service ever! Bought 2 tickets for $400 each. No seats. Got to the airport early to check-in (even checked in online 24 hours prior). Told we had to wait to get our seats after all customers had gotten theirs because we had Economy Class tickets. Have to wait in line again. Will never fly AA again. Will pay extra for any airline that treats customers better. Cannot imagine Delta doing this.
270," Atlanta to Miami with American Airlines. The worst service ever. Here’s what went wrong: 1) The person boarding was mean and horrible (I wonder how a person this unpleasant is allowed to be in any passenger facing role) 2) The manager was mean and horrible 3) They let me know that they needed to check my bag. When I said that I would like to speak to a manager because I am not comfortable with that, they were yelling and said I had 2 minutes to get on the plane. Their first move was to give an ultimatum. I would have understood had they asked nicely, but their terrible attitude really didn't help. "
271,"Not Verified | New York to Rome. I am an American Advantage Gold member who has flown to Europe multiple times using AA and its British Airways partner. In July, I purchased a Business Class ticket for 9/19 through American Express travel that was billed as British Airways #1585. I checked in at JFK 3 hours before the flight to learn that it was actually AA #236. That didn’t seem to pose any problem since my Business Class ticket was in AA’s system I was given a boarding pass for a Business Class seat 10A around 2:30 pm for my 5pm flight. Sometime during the next two hours, while I relaxed unaware in the Admirals Lounge, I was bumped out of my seat to a “Premium Economy” seat. I received no email notification nor was there any notification on the AA app. When I arrived at the gate expecting to walk into Business Class I was stopped and given an ultimatum and five minutes to decide whether to board and take the downgrade or roll the dice and fly the next day, losing a day of vacation. Of course, AA already had my luggage on the plane. The explanations I was provided for this incident were conflicting but none of them is acceptable. I was told I had purchased thru British Airways. Why should this matter? If BA premium tickets are subject to revocation then the partnership with AA is a sham. I was also told by an agent on the phone that there had been an equipment change a few months ago resulting in fewer Business Class seats available. If so, why was I issued my Business Class boarding pass at check-in, and why wasn't I notified in advance? I was also told at the gate that American had simply “oversold” Business Class and that even though I’m an Advantage Gold member I was first on the list to be downgraded. If so, that is a despicable practice. Passengers at the gate and seated around me on the plane were equally appalled. No one had ever heard of such a thing. I have been offered a voucher for future travel but I promise you it cannot begin to compensate for the ruining of the start what was supposed to be a dream vacation. I now will spend the next several weeks dreading the possibility that the same thing could happen to me on my return home from Rome. If Business Class seats mean nothing and can be downgraded what is the point of having them and what is the point of spending all that money? I was then told that I would be afforded “Business Class” treatment and amenities in my downgraded seat location but (no surprise) that was also a failure. I have been an American Advantage customer for over 30 years. This is by far the most disappointing experience I have ever had with any airline. I have lost faith in this airline."
272,"Not Verified |  Washington DC to New York. Absolutely the worst airline to fly with and the customer service representative was cutting me off as I was speaking while I was trying to explain my situation. Typically with other airlines I'm given a confirmation email that I'm checked in after checking in online, but I was not given one so I called customer service to verify. I had already screenshotted the website saying I'm checked in. The 1st customer service rep put in my confirmation number and said I was not checked in. So I told her I had clearly checked in online and she said ""Well, I have no answers. You can take it up with our web services. I have no idea why you're not checked in."" She switched me over to the ""web services customer rep"", who when asked said ""you're checked in"" without asking for any confirmation number or my name. So I explained that the other customer service representative had put in my number and specifically said I'm not checked in, at which point this customer service rep cut me off and said ""you're checked in. I don't know what else to tell you."" and when I asked her how she knew I was checked in if she hadn't received my information, she said ""You're checked in. I'm giving you a straight answer that you're checked in. You can go to the airport now and verify if you want."" Is that really the answer AA gives to its customers when their own employees are giving customers inconsistent answers? Never flying American again."
273,"  Dallas to Laredo. Worst airline, horrible service. They changed our gate and never told anyone.  10 of us all stranded. We even made the gate before they closed the door. They closed the gate in front of us and said sorry flight closed. Seriously. Not a single notice, text alert or announcement. We sat at the wrong gate for 20 minutes without a single notice then ran to the other gate when another passenger his flight was just changed to our gate. Customer service agent working gate 23. Horrible. Wouldn’t give us the name of the gate agent because was worried the agent would be fired and she wouldn’t be able to find another job."
274," Omaha to San Francisco via Dallas with American Airlines. This airline is a disorganized mess. Do whatever you have to in order to not fly this airline. They overbook flights and beg paying customers to wait for additional delays due to their poor planning. Besides being generally disorganized and thoughtless with customers valuable time, they waited until the entire plane was boarded to inform us that we were delayed by an hour and would have to wait in the plane as they did not have a runway for us to take off or land on. They had us board so they could trap us on the plane with no choice but to wait. This is ridiculous."
275,"  Baltimore to Phoenix via Fresno with American Airlines. Started off poorly. Upon arrival at BWI, received text that flight had been canceled but rescheduled at Reagan Airport, in another state. No comp offered even though the wait was 5+ hours. In Phoenix, boarding agent gave us a red tag. Discovered we had to attach to bag and give to crew at airplane door so they could handle due to lack of space. When we took off, we counted no less than 4 completely empty bins overhead. Upon arrival, bags arrived on ramp and just passed around among the waiting passengers. Coming back from Fresno, through Phoenix, the flight was delayed while they tried to find their pilots, per flight attendant's announcement! Top prices for tickets no longer mean good service with American. Very uncaring, unprofessional airline. Their rep as an airline always on time, and the top of the heap airline is gone, gone, gone. Would recommend choosing another airline unless you have no choice."
276," I flew from MSP to NYC with a connection through Charlotte. The weather in Charlotte was bad (obviously not anyone's fault) so I ended up having to fly the next day. Then, on my flight back to MSP that connected again to Charlotte, my flight was bumped up 2 hours earlier without any notification whatsoever, which I didn't realize until I tried to check in to my flight. The AA representative in New York was incredibly helpful, rebooked me though Chicago asap and personally escorted me to the front of the TSA line so that I could make the flight that was currently in the process of boarding. I somehow made that flight, only to be stuck on the tarmack once we landed in Chicago because no gates were open. Because of this I ended up missing the connecting flight into Minneapolis and having to stay overnight in Chicago airport, as was the case with multiple other passengers on that flight. AA didn't offer any further accomodations other than rebooking, which I guess is just the price you pay for trying to travel if you're poor. The frontline staff who work for American Airlines are nice and helpful and I'm sorry that they have to stand by their disorganized company that clearly doesn't care about its customers."
277,"  Seoul Incheon to Tucson via Dallas Ft Worth. Worst airline to fly with. I had to fly home from Korea on emergency leave because my wife was giving birth to twins. I had a flight booked with American to fly from Korea to the US. based on the due date. She had to have an emergency C section and i had to change my flight. Changing a flight has been a nightmare since it began. I no longer needed my departure date since i had to leave earlier. I just wanted to use the return portion of my flight. American didn't want to change my flight at all. I was told i had apply for a refund and cancel all flight arrangements. Ok, a little dumb but, no problem i did that. Then i tried to schedule my return flight to Korea and was told that i have to leave from Korea in order to use my ticket. But i am already in the US and was never told this before. The person on the other end said ""I'm sorry those are the rules for international flight"". When was i going to be told about this rule? Apparently after they are have my money and there is no possible way of getting it back. I will never fly this terrible company again."
278,  Miami to São Paulo. I was not given the standard service when flying with this airline. I was ignored and just didn’t feel welcomed. Staff had terrible attitudes especially when I asked for headphones and I was told by a staff member that he was busy and I was ignored by the other staff who were not willing to assist me at all. I’ve travelled with other airlines a lot and I’ve never been treat this way. I wrote the review the same day I travelled with this airline but I got no response. Hopefully I hear something back this time.
279," This is the worst airline experience I have had with American Airlines (AA). On my connecting flight, they downgraded our airplane to a smaller one without telling us until the last minute of the flight. I was forced to stand in line over 20 minutes for them to tell me that there was a problem with my ticket. They then put me in another line (30 minutes) that was for people who didn't have a seat assignment. After standing in this line, the same person that told me there was a problem with my ticket, issued me a new one. Why did I have to stand in line an additional 30 minutes for this guy to give me a new ticket? Needless to say, we were over an hour late getting into Chicago. On the way back from Dallas to Jackson, AA gave us the worst commercial plane I had ever flown on. Paint was peeling on the interior of the plane, the windows wouldn't even stay up when we tried to block out the sun, and when we hit a little turbulence, the entire overhead bins vibrated so loudly, almost everyone on the plane was alarmed. This is truly, the first time that I have flown, that I was scared. I flown to Japan several times and that was a 10 hour flight. Nothing rattled me like the 1 hour and 15 minute flight from Dallas to Jackson. I will never fly AA again!!"
280,  Indianapolis to Chicago. If I could leave 0 stars I would. First and last time I'll fly. Didn't check my luggage all the way through my flight and then blamed me when I arrived in London without my luggage. They knew my bag was in Chicago but couldn't be bothered to send it to me without a three page form that asked the most ridiculous questions. I'm sure it was to discourage anyone from making a claim. I mean who keeps receipts on all the prescription medication they purchased? 
281,"Not Verified |  Boston to Los Angeles on American Airlines. The ticket prices were reasonable, and the ground service was acceptable. The seat was also fine, but could use some improvements. Some of the cabin crew were rude and had a unpleasant attitude. The ground service was better at least. Only beverages were free, food costed money which was annoying on such a long flight. The entertainment was fine, but it needs improvement as well. I would choose another option next time if I have one, but I wouldn’t avoid this airline altogether."
282,"Not Verified |  Thank you American Air Lines for saving the day. On August 10 my 17 yrs old daughter was traveling alone from Hartford to San Juan, Puerto Rico leaving Hartford at 6:00 am but got late to the airport missing her flight by few minutes. The customer service representative at the gate knowing that my daughter was a minor traveling alone went out of her way like no other airline has  done for my family. She made every possible thing she could have done to get my daughter safely home to us She gave snacks and drinks to my daughter while she reassured her that she’ll find her another flight so she could get home. She did everything in her power to help my daughter and I’m truly thankful of her efforts cause I was home worried sick of thinking that my daughter was stranded at the airport and I couldn’t help her. I’m so thankful of the rep at the gate who made sure my daughter get home that day, whoever you are thank you so much cause now I’m at peace knowing for next time too American Airlines got my back and will do whatever it has to do to keep my kids safe when traveling alone ."
283,"Not Verified |  Took a flight from Phoenix to Charlotte with American Airlines. Flight left at just after 2pm and arrived in Charlotte around 10pm yet only crackers and beverages were offered. We finally get to gate and the actual pedestrian bridge won’t turn on so we wait for 25 minutes before they finally get it working. By the time we all make into the terminal a majority of us have to run to make our connection. Of course, even if there had been time to eat, no restaurants are open at this time. Eventually make it on to my connection but sit there for over 30 minutes because some genius decided to schedule multiple departures at 10.20 pm on a Sunday night and the taxiway is clogged. I wish this was atypical but just the usual."
284,Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Dallas Ft Worth. This is possibly the worst airline we have ever flown. The plane itself is very nice but the customer service is awful. The people are rude and disrespectful. These people look like they hate their job and after talking to them you will leave with a bitter taste in your mouth.
285,"  Asheville to Indianapolis via Charlotte. I had to take a small plane out if Asheville because there are no direct flights. In Charlotte I gave the bagger my ticket outside plane and was given a different bag. It looked very similar to my bag & I did not notice until I got all the way home & my keys were not in the front pocket of my bag to get into my house several states away. From Charlotte to Indy: I was in seat 9F which is 2 seats behind 1st class. However, I was boarded last & all overhead bins were full. I think the airline should assign the luggage spot with the seat.  Nothing offered to lower class citizens."
286,"  I have yet to be on an American trip that at least one segment didn’t involve ridiculous delays or maintenance issues, or both. And here I am, again. Shame on me. Unreal, yet they continue to get away with it."
287,Not Verified |  Tucson to Richmond. We had a change over and the arrival plane was late and the connection closed early so we missed our connection. This airline is terrible and I will never fly it again. The plane was old and not updated. They showed a children movie in these tiny monitors that spans over 3 rows. The worker managing counter had no knowledge and ignored me when I tried to tell them door closed 15 minutes early. It has been the worse flight yet! I will never fly America airlines again.
288,Not Verified |  Orlando to Dallas. I will never fly America Airlines again. They delayed the flight like 8 times and I have sat in the airport for 6 hours and when I asked questions nothing but attitude. American airlines suck and I will never fly them again.
289,"  Las Vegas to Los Angeles. Was expecting more inflight service than a drink and packet of crisps for a First Class fare. The seat was big and comfortable, but service lacking for the price paid. Crew were functional at best, no warmth or sincerity. Arrived early, but this was negated by the hour long wait for luggage in LAX."
290,"  Dallas to Reykjavik. American Airlines did a wonderful job in business class. The flight attendants were friendly, helpful, and attentive. The food was excellent especially the salmon. The movie selection was great. Sound system was wonderful. They kept the toilets clean. I normally use foreign carriers when in business, but I have no complaints about this airline. Plus they arrived on time."
291,  Salt Lake City to Dallas Ft Worth. Horrible service with very old planes and high prices compared to competitors. My last 4 flights with AA were delayed due to something being broken on the plane. Previous flight was first class and no TVs in the first class cabin. American Airlines planes always seem to be dirty and I need to wipe down the seat and tray areas personally. Definitely a substandard airline in all aspects. Online checkin / boarding pass system is often broken.
292,"  Phoenix to Reykjavik via Dallas Ft Worth. Great experience with this airline traveling to Iceland and return. No issues whatsoever. Lounges in Dallas were great, especially at D terminal, in which it is new."
293,"  Chicago to LaGuardia. Check-in was ok, slightly grumpy but warmed up. Security was awful: a supposed priority lane took 45 minutes to clear - the slowest crew ever. Flight was delayed which, I could see, was due to a plane switch. The original incoming plane had landed on time but we then were switched to another. Pushed back about 45 mins late. Crew were invisible so no pre-flight drink whatsoever, whereas both Delta and United offer this service. Drinks eventually came, with a cheese plate which was fine. Arrived at LGA 30 minutes late. The terminal is awful and the Uber parking lot even worse."
294,"  Albany to Charlotte. Was talked to like a dog from lady at the gate and then made me check a bag when I was carrying a book bag. Will never fly American again,  I asked why and she responded with none of my business. I was not asked if I would like a drink or snack anything, very dissatisfied with everything!"
295,"  Miami to Houston. I would like to make mention of the incredible service the passengers in first class have been extended meanwhile the remaining passengers (I paid for priority and am seated in 8F) have to beg the rude cabin flight attendant for water. While I do not expect first class service I do expect to have some level service. The gentleman in first class has exceptional customer service and should be commended as such. I would like to call out specifically the male flight attendant offering service in the back cabin for his rude behavior. When I approached the back of the plane and asked if we could be provided service the woman flight attendant asked what I would like, I stated a glass of wine. The rude male attendant chimes in no wine ... literally that short. So then I say how about a cup of tea, as the plane is cold and we at this point have been boarded since 9:45ish and it’s clear after 10:40 pm- please note our original flight was to land on HOU at approximately 9:45 pm. He states you can have water ... so question one, why ask what I would like and then speak harshly to “the customer.” After another series of it will be another 15-20 minutes, I push the attendant button and ask (again speaking of the rude attendant) if he would ask the captain to make a special accommodation as we were to arrive in HOU at 9:45 pm for a cup of tea. He loudly states, in an inappropriate and quite honestly embarrassing manner to the cabin, she originally asked for alcohol. I do not accept being humiliated or shamed when the airline is at fault for my inconvenience. Flight number AA 2475 was to depart from gate D36 (after arriving from Curaçao (AA 2739). As I reached gate D30, I received a notification that the gate had changed to D10. We arrived at the gate and boarded the plan. Slightly after the plane is fully boarded the pilot comes on and states there are mechanical problems and that it will be about 20-30 minutes. And then states we would need to deboard. In the terminal we are told that we would have some information no later than 11 pm. I ask to be moved to the 10:05 pm flight and the gate agent tells me it would be better to stay on this flight as they were going to take the 10:05 pm plane and give it to us. This later proved to be false. I have so little confidence in the American Airlines team. We are then told to go to E9 for immediate departure (9:45 pm). It is now 11:43 pm and every 20 minutes or so we are told that we will be departing. It’s paperwork, it’s pictures. But here is the problem. I’ve asked several times for something to drink. We know it is permissible because the people in first class have had multiple rounds of cocktails. So tell me water is the only  option after several hours, is yet another lie by your very rude flight attendant. While I understand mechanical issues, the problem here is the inconsistent information, half-truths and more importantly the lack of attention given to the passengers not in first class. It wasn't until I asked for the second time that we (non-First class attendants) were even offered water after boarding, deboarding, reboarding and waiting for hours. "
296," London to New York. Traditionally I have flown BA first class across the Atlantic but this trip I decided to try American to compare. American check-in was fast and efficient. The President's Lounge was, comfortable with adequate food but not as well-appointed as the BA Concorde lounge. The American open 'suite' (seat) was in my opinion more comfortable than the BA equivalent - they have proper leg rests that BA does not have and the ability to swing the chair onto a working desk if required. The bed was spacious and comfortable. The in-flight food was good with a reasonable choice. The wine list was not impressive but then neither is BA's. Oddly, AA charge first-class passengers for wi-fi connection! In my opinion, there is not a great deal in it but the American seat probably tips the comparison in favour of American in the air but on the ground BA have better lounge facilities."
297,"Not Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Guatemala. One day before my flight as I was checking in, I saw the message that said that the flight was overbooked and $175 individual vouchers were offered to anyone with flexible schedules who were willing to change their flight to 2 days later. I was unable to check in online because I was traveling with a minor. The morning of my check-in, I arrived at the airport to find that the gate number on my original receipt was closed and after walking around for 20 minutes we finally arrived at the counter. When we were at the counter, I heard an airport employee say to another traveler that the American Airlines flight had been cancelled. I chose to disregard the airport employee and go to the counter because after all he was not an American Airlines employee and they should know better, right? I checked my bags in, printed my tickets and headed through security. As soon as I arrived I noticed a long line of people waiting to talk to the customer service rep at the gate to re-schedule a flight because the flight had been cancelled due to an ""operational decision"" whatever that means. I called the customer service line and they told me that I couldn't change the flight with them on the phone that I had to wait for the person at the counter. After 1 hour of waiting, I finally spoke to the person at the gate counter. He printed some ""tickets"" for me and told me that I had been re-booked to another flight the next day at 1:00 pm. I took his word for it. Later that morning I called the customer service line, because I had a feeling something wasn't right. After I talked to the person on the phone they told me that I wasn't on the 1:00 pm flight that I hadn't been re-booked. I tried to explain that person that I had tickets and an e-mail that said that I was on that flight but she kept telling me that I wasn't on their system. I got upset and asked for a supervisor, she had the same empathetic attitude as the first employee. I asked for my flight to be booked the next day and she was able to find me a flight for the same time as before. When I asked to change my returning flight to the next day in the afternoon she told me that she could price those out for me. I told her that given the circumstances and the fact that it wasn't my problem that plans have changed she should consider changing my flights at no cost. After a lot of back and forth she finally agreed to move my flight. I had to pay for seats on my returning flight because originally, my wife, my daughter and I had seats next to each other. On my departing flight we did not get seats that were next to each other because the flight was full and we had to rely on the generosity of another traveler to allow my wife to seat next to our daughter. We had to pay a very sketchy Uber driver to bring us back home that morning after losing sleep, time and going to tears from our daughter because she wasn't going to see her grandma that day. Our parents had to lose another day of work, lots of sleep and time to bring us to the airport yet again the next day. My mom in Guatemala had to make another 3 hour unnecessary trip to the Guatemalan airport because I didn't arrive on the day I was supposed to. We had to pay more to change our original car reservation because of ""high demand"" To top it all off my bag was damaged on my returning flight which to be frank I don't even understand how that happened because the bag was damaged from the zipper. "
298,"  Barcelona to Chicago. Very rude and unprofessional Flight Attendant, in all my years of travelling I have never had any one treat me like that. It started with me saying ""excuse me"" (because I had a question) She turned around and said in a rude manner ""What do you want?"" I was shocked and I said ""I'm sorry did I catch you at a bad time""? She then raised her voice and in an exasperated tone stated 'what do you need sir' at that point I said ""you know what nothing from you"" she said ""suit yourself"" and walked away. things went from bad to worse from there. Another incident was with the food she did not like the way I opened my tray and said ""I am not putting up with this I will call the Captain on you"" I said ""please do call him I would like to speak to him"". The FA said "" I will call him for me but I am not going to waste his time calling him for you"" - she told my wife I was rude, my wife told her she was rude first she walked away. "
299," I flew from London to Greenville via Chicago in July with five children (one being only 2 years old) when we arrived from London in Chicago, our flight was delayed twice and then cancelled. How did I know it was cancelled? The staff at the desk unplugged the monitor and went home. Already having been delayed twice we had been sitting in the airport for a while. I couldn’t move easily because the airline had my stroller. I couldn’t find a member of staff to help me or advise me at all. No idea when my rebooked flight would be, where I would sleep the night. Legally I couldn’t really leave the airport without a car seat so I’m stuck in a town I don’t know, with five tired children snd not one single member of staff to assist. I don’t even know when the next flight will be ! This is disgusting service. I had to go find a taxi that would take us without a car seat, help me find a hotel that could accommodate and pay for this all myself. When I complained to the airline they said they take no responsibility for anything that happens to passengers if they cancel a flight. So I highly recommended never flying with this airline as you could just get left mid flight in a random location without any support or assistance. And guess what!? They don’t care!"
300, Washington to Tampa with American Airlines. The flight was heavily delayed. No proper information was given. Ground staff didn't look interested. After seating we had to wait another 45 minutes til take-off. Flight was ok. Arrived almost midnight. Altogether a rather bad experience.
301, Huntsville to Dallas. This is the third week in a row flight 5903 has had long delays and last week was cancelled. It is unacceptable for an airline to have this kind of performance. Last week they cancelled all flights due to weather even though the weather cleared up by 8:30 pm. I travel exclusively on American but am doubting my loyalty. It seems like it’s so much harder to be platinum and don't know if it’s worth it when you travel primarily national flights. I have over 1.3 million miles on this airline. I think other airlines have better seats and some better service. Gives me pause to continue my loyalty. Plus this route is crazy-expensive $700 to $1100 every week.
302,"Not Verified |  Flight cancelled or delayed most of the time at the last moment. New excuses every Weekend. 1) Sometimes the flight doesn't have fuel, 2) flight door is not closing. 3) Pilot changes at the last moment. 4) Trash not cleared by seats, and they need time to clear that. These excuses come when passengers are already on board. Crazy - don't care about passengers travelling and impact on their entire journey."
303," I was flying from Canton, OH to Myrtle Beach with a connecting flight at Charlotte. I was traveling with two fourteen-year old girls. Once our flight landed in Charlotte, they issued a two hour delay. An hour and a half into the delay, they completely cancelled our flight at 11.30 pm. I was told by the ticket agent that our particular flight was cancelled due to a maintenance issue. Their only offer of a solution was to get us on another flight two days later, which would entail a seven hour trip (flying up to Washington DC, then back south to Myrtle Beach). We would not arrive at Myrtle until 7.00 pm two days later. Our family drove there and were waiting for our arrival. We would have missed out on two of our five days there. I told the agent this was not an acceptable option. So, at midnight we were rushing through an unfamiliar airport trying desperately to get to a rental car agency to secure a car rental. After being up 18 hours at that point, we rented a car from Hertz for a 24 hour period $292.66. I drove four hours and arrived at Myrtle at 4.00 am. It was not a pleasant experience. I called the AA customer service by 10.00 am and was told to submit all of the receipts for the costs I incurred because AA cancelled our flight. I was assured I would be reimbursed for the rental car because the flight was cancelled due to maintenance issues, not related to weather. I filed my request to AA on July 9th. I submitted all receipts on July 16th. I wrote to them again on July 31st because I had received no response. On August 1st I received a generic letter stating they would refund each of us $87.02 for the portion of the flight that was cancelled. They gave each of us $150 flight vouchers, which I will not use. I wrote back on August 1st and 2nd stating I needed my refund for the rental car and that the vouchers were useless to us. They wrote back on the 2nd stating they will not refund me and continuously ended each letter with ""we're eager to serve you again"". I filed a complaint with the DOT and a month later received another generic letter stating that they gave me a refund for the cancelled flight portion and a voucher. They refuse to reimburse me for the rental car. They stated they offered another flight (this was available two days later). They actually expected a woman and two 14-year old girls to accept a flight two days later and to just hang out at the airport? I will never attempt to fly with American Airlines. There is no phone number for a supervisor. I was told ""we do not escalate our customer complaints to a supervisor"". They did not treat us as paying customers, only as numbers. Their responses were all generic. They did not treat us with the respect we deserved."
304,"Not Verified | Nashville to Antigua via Miami. American Airlines no more. I travel frequently for both business and pleasure. Due to both budget and schedule constraints, we flew American Airlines from Nashville to Antigua and back. The premium economy seats were comfortable. The service was very poor. On the two outbound flights, cabin service was non-existent. On the return flights, cabin service occurred but was conducted by one very rude stewardess. The price for the seat did not include equitable benefits to what is provided by other airlines of equal class. The wifi was good enough to connect and submit this review. The food (for purchase) was stale."
305,"  Los Angeles to Miami. Every time I fly American there is so type of problem due to incompetent employees who don’t know what they are doing. We have flown American about 4 times and the first time we flew them we signed up for their Aadvantage card thinking it would be worth getting the miles. On our most recent trip our flight on Tuesday Sep. 3 was canceled due to the hurricane back home in Florida. They let us pick which flight back and only had one Thursday with a layover. My boyfriends sister was flying back to Miami the same day which did not get canceled. That night we called American to get on that flight back so we could just drive home and not be stuck in LA for three extra days. The lady on the phone told my boyfriend that we can’t change our flight to land into another city because we bought our tickets using the points from our AAdvantage card?  What ever, that night we booked two extra nights on a hotel that was over 100$ a night because we were going to be stuck here. The next morning I got a notification letting me know there are two extra flights available to take Tuesday morning that would land us in Melbourne Florida and not Orlando which didn’t make any sense considering the worker said there are no flights for us besides Orlando. We call in the morning again to see about getting on the flight to Miami yet again and the lady on that phone said we could do it. So she put us on that flight so we could get home that day. We did not have enough clothes or even money to be able to spend two and a half extra days in LA between the hotel, rental car, gas etc. Of course the hotel was non refundable and we had to argue with them to get our money back. BUT all of this could have been avoided if the employees knew what they were doing. So we get to the airport Tuesday morning to head on the Miami flight which the app told us that we had to go to a counter to check in. So of course the workers holding the line up asks us what we are doing which we show them the phone and they go “well did you try the kiosk” I said “no because it says right here we have to check in with a person and not online. So of course he said to go wait in that line to see -  after 10 minutes of waiting I get to the kiosk to just get told by the machine to check in with the counter. So we go to the counter desk and a huge line that we waiting in for 40 minutes .. after getting to someone they clearly didn’t know what they were doing because two employees just shoved us off to the next employee .. some guy in the Miami airport counter just clocked in and two employees just told him to figure it out. They were telling us that the lady we spoke to on the phone this morning did not change our ticket in the system yet we had a confirmation with seat numbers to our email. After about an hour of all this we finally got our tickets. I never have any problems with any airline but this one. "
306,"Not Verified |  Atlanta to Dallas Ft Worth via Salt Lake City. I can't say i have heard anyone speak of of this but my comment pertains to the noise level inside the cabin during flight. I made a recording on my last flight, 8/28/2019, that averaged 105dB. At this level serious hearing damage can occur within 8 hours. I find this quite alarming."
307,"  American Airlines canceled their flight from Columbia SC to Washington DC (Regan) - Flight was to take off at 7:40pm then delayed multiple times. Ticket policy is they are not obligated to compensation if caused by weather, which is true! At issue is that their own plane took off after the weather delay for a leg to Washington (Regan) then was to return for a 2nd leg that was canceled with no further weather issues, leaving us stranded until the next morning. This was not a weather issue it was a business decision not to send the plane back for the final leg of their days flight, the claim that it was weather related was to not obligate for compensation. The secret is that pilots and flight crew have union and FAA limitations on how many hours they can fly in a given day / time period by not sending a replacement crew (the good old days) and claiming the cancellation was due to weather and not mechanoical - my position is crew unavailability is mechanical (compensation due) and not weather. Only compensation was completion of the flight the following morning (presumably the same aircraft which was delayed to get the aircraft back into the normal flight rotation ""back and forth between the 2 airports) After requesting a credit or a ticket at a future date as a courtesy American Airlines customer relations rejected twice. Poor customer relations leaving passengers stranded then dodging their obligations."
308,"Not Verified |  Albany to Nassau. My wife and I booked a flight on aa.com. We booked an all inclusive resort called the Melia. This was the most relaxing vacation we have ever taken. From the ticket handlers to the baggage handlers to flight attendants to the pilots, everyone was very professional. The Melia resort was great. I highly recommend aa.com and the Melia Nassau. Thank you both for making this a great vacation."
309,"Not Verified | Grand Cayman to Seattle via Dallas. We always get stuck in Dallas with American - we all joke about it. But that's not the point. I'm writing this review because I have spent 4 weeks trying to book a trip on American using my miles that are expiring. aa.com offers many flights, but when I click on any one of them it says ""This flight is no longer available"" The ""no longer available"" flights are displayed continuously for the last 4 weeks. Phone operator explains that it's because it's an overnight flight, but does not seem to understand: 1) website response does not say it's not available due to overnight flight, and 2) it continues to offer up this option to customers. How can we understand their website if it offers flights that are not available, and does not advise customers why the flights are not available. Frustrating!"
310,"  Caught a 3-30pm flight from Barcelona to Chicago with a 2-year old. There were several families with small children on the back of the plane. Kids will be kids and parents did their best to occupy them. At 6pm a flight attendant tells us to keep our kids quiet because some folks are sleeping. How do keep a 2-year old who wants to romp around and sing songs quiet? It is already difficult to keep them contained! I am sorry American Airlines - you can do better! Maybe it is time for a family-friendly section? I would pay extra. Also, the flight attendant can use some more training on being more family-friendly! Disclaimer: I understand not everyone likes kids, but families do and will travel! We as parents also want comfort and respect! Please be aware, that we paid the same price and my kid is also a customer!"
311,Not Verified |  Newport News to San Francisco. American Airlines has the rudest staff I have encountered in my lifetime. Everyone starting from the person standing at the gate to the air hostesses don’t have a hint of courtesy of sense about customer care. I would never use American Airlines again and recommend not to use it.
312,"Not Verified |  Dallas to Albuquerque. This is by far, the worst airline. We sat on The tarmac, for over two hours with no water, even available to the passengers. Trying to fly home, we waited, and waited before our flight was cancelled. They refused to reroute us with South West. We have to get up at 2:30am to fly out by 5am tomorrow. We have no way back, to the airport. They absolutely refused to help us, in any way. They refused us a voucher for food. I have never experienced such horrible customer service. I will never fly with them again. The worst experience ever! A huge disappointment. Thanks, for ruining my weekend. "
313,"  Dallas-Fort Worth to Seattle. I just wanted to say that I was very pleased with one of the flight attendants on this flight. Stephanie maintained a light hearted, professional attitude on both accounts where one of the other flight attendants was being hostile. The other flight attendant was giving her attitude and acting like an adolescent in front of us when it clearly had nothing to do with Stephanie either. Instead of stooping to her level, Stephanie kept a smile and even apologized to the other lady and continued to serve us our beverages. This happened on two accounts. It just made me feel better as customer on this flight to see that there’s at least one very caring and kind attendant on board. If only I could guarantee she’d be on all my flights, then I would fly AA more. If you could pass this positive feedback to her, that’d be great!"
314,"  Philadelphia to London, please think twice before booking American Airlines for your travel needs, especially from Philadelphia Airport. On Monday 8/19/19 we had a flight that was suppose to depart at 10pm. Around 8pm (2 hours prior) we already received the first delay. This went on several times until 4:15am when they finally had us board the flight. Once boarded it was announced that it was now cancelled. My husband and I were traveling internationally with our 10 & 7 year old kids who were sleep and exhausted. I don’t understand why they didn’t just cancel it earlier .. felt strung along not knowing what’s going on from 8pm to 4:30am. If you ask them they just kept saying “mechanical issue.” If they had made a decision earlier instead of holding us all night we could have had more options for switching and rebooking the flight. So at 4:30 am we have no idea how we are getting to LHR and the worst part was the aftermath. Dealing with AA’s ticket agents and customer service was terrible. Not only to us but to others on that flight. No comfort, no apologies, no care. Just pure rude like it was our fault. No one went above and beyond to assist us with our issue. We were talked down to and in front of our children. I mentioned to one woman that “you have no idea what we have been through this evening so maybe a kinder tone would help.” As we try to explain what happened they reply “ we already know your situation!” Eye Rolling, argumentative, “this is all we can do,” dismissive attitudes while stuck in airport. Getting the hotel vouchers we were told “well you can try but they will probably make you check out at 11am.” They showed that they didn’t care at all what we went though and it was not there problem. To them it happens all the time, but they should be trained to have a more understanding attitude to customers going though stuff like this. Our flight was rebooked through AA over the phone since no one at airport had a care. Marriot at the airport is where we slept and showered an waited for our rebooked flight which left 8/20/19 at 7:30pm (which also had a delay). Marriott staff were the only kind ones we dealt with. What was really crazy is we don’t even know how we got on AA. This flight was booked through Expedia and was for British Airways. British Air is who charged are card but we show up and we are actually with American who “services” British Air 🤷🏽‍♀️ I have contacted them and sent email and hoping they will offer something for that mess they made."
315,"  Flew AA in paid first Austin to Palm Springs via Los Angeles, returning via PHX back to AUS. On time and quick flight to DFW, pre-departure beverage and another once airborne. DFW to PSP clean Boeing 737-800 with at seat entertainment. really nice breakfast from very friendly crew. We travel to Palm Springs every other month and simply love the high spirits on these flights. All flights on time with spot on crews. We always find AA consistent in Premium Cabins."
316,"  London to Chicago.  I was worried about a supposedly imminent British Airways strike so switched to American Airlines. Pros: new aircraft; comfortable seat; quiet engines. Cons: loud crew who spoke incessantly across the galley to one another, not service oriented or discreet like staff on BA or Swiss; food sub-standard compared to foreign airlines; a bit surly to the point of my wondering whether they were taking out their frustrations with management on the customers (they mentioned upcoming contract negotiations). American Airlines should learn from the competition and improve its training of stewardesses. Perhaps they should be better paid so customers wouldn't have to put up with loudmouths."
317,  New York to Reno via Los Angeles. Indifferent customer service. Delays on every flight and diverted to LA without seats to get back to NJ - even though I was booked first-class 2 months in advance to have direct flights from Reno to NY. Please avoid this airline.
318,"Not Verified |  I flew with American Airlines to Europe to spend with a family friend and others. The flight  was wonderful, smooth takeoff and landing, friendly staff and a wonderful selection of food.  However upon landing in Germany we discovered our luggage had been left in the states. After letting one of the staff know this we were told it’d be only 1 or 2 days before our luggage would be delivered to the location we were staying at. It was a full week before we got some luggage back and 2 more days before I received mine, despite us both coming from the exact same place to the exact same place. We discovered that apparently our luggage was transported to France, where they discovered our location was closer to Germany so they sent it back to the states and then to Germany, instead of double checking which one would be closer they wasted time sending it back and forth. During the time we didn’t have our luggage we contacted customer support multiple times and weren’t told anything, our emails went unresponded to and our calls wouldn’t be picked up. Despite a wonderful flight, due to this horrendous mismanagement of our luggage I will never be flying with American Airlines ever again. Other airlines I’ve flown with might have less comfortable seats or a more mediocre selection of in flight entertainment but at least none of them ever lost my luggage for over a week."
319,"  Fresno to Memphis via Dallas. Worst airline ever. Never flying with American Airlines again or recommending this airline. They kept delaying for half an hour for 4 hours straight and after boarding, they got us out saying the the pilot is illegal now. Saw that happen to three flights while Ii was waiting to catch my flight to Memphis. There were a lot of people who requested to get just a bus or pay for rental car and we can carpool with people going to Memphis. Nothing! Had no flights available for two days."
320,  Horrendous customer service. We had booked our trip through American Airlines from PHL to CHA. But we missed our flight from PHL due to emergency situation and we bought tickets through another airline and made it to CHA. But American airlines cancelled our whole trip and told us there is nothing they can do about this. There was no disclaimer I saw online while booking that they will cancel if I missed one way flight! Horrible customer service and they don’t care about their customers! Because of them we had to $1000 to get back home! 
321,Not Verified |  Oklahoma City to Seattle. Garbage. Slightly better than Spirit and Frontier but honestly just barely. Checked in 3 hours after open check in and zero seats available that aren’t over $40 per seat for some decent but still ridiculous leg room.
322,Not Verified |  Charleston to Seattle. A ticket was purchased about 2 months in advance. Departure times verified. On 23 Aug 2019 I was to take off from Charleston WV to North Carolina and then home to Seattle . My flight was delayed 3 times. Customer service indicated that it was due to weather (research indicates that is not accurate). Customer service representative indicated that this was due to lack of flight personnel to fly. I was rebooked on a flight for 24 Aug 2019 at 4:35 AM. This flight was as well delayed. Landing in Chicago I was forced to miss my connection and placed on standby for the next flight out. My husband purchased a one way first class ticket for me to depart Chicago at 5 PM. I later found out that American Airlines had rebooked me on the 5 PM flight as well. I cancelled the 1st class ticket and received e-mail traffic confirming that the ticket was cancelled. My credit card statement shows the flight but no refund.
323," Mexico City to New York. Never flying with American Airlines again. They continuously leave my partner and I stranded due to them never making their connecting flights. We never have a problem with other airlines and if we do they hold themselves accountable. AA just has this ""well that's too bad, we cant do anything"" attitude towards their customers. I find myself saying ""Jet Blue would never"". Seriously they will miss their connecting flights due to needing to land the plane at a different airport to get fuel and somehow tell you ""well we didn't make the connecting flight due to weather and that just isn't our fault"" and then tell you they have no more flights until you hound them and still the wait will be over 8-9 hours. This isn't the first time AA has done this to us but it will be the last. This disgustingly unprofessional airline isn't worth the trouble and even when their connecting flights seem like a steal price-wise you end up paying for it when they don't make it on time and they leave you stranded."
324,  San Antonio to Chicago. Majority of the time my flights and everyone I know that has flew American has a delayed flight due to maintenance. No back up aircraft available so delays are hours if not canceled. Most aircraft is old and has no outlets for charging. We all carry electrics now days and need to keep them charged. The new aircraft have more narrow cramped seats with no leg or hip room. I'm small compared to most adult so that is ridiculous. Also the seats are tilted forward which make you feel like your sliding out of an already uncomfortable seat. 1 out of 2 staff is rude and in accommodating when trying to change to an open seat that no one will be flying in. Yes people pay more to ensure they have a reserved seats of their preference but if it's empty just prior to boarding why not allow others to take an open seat. I will not choose to fly American if I have other options.
325,"  Paris to San Francisco via Dallas with my daughter. We had valid boarding pass and when we go to gate, we found that our seats were sold somebody else and denied boarding on the basis that we are not early enough at the gate. No attempt made to announce our names when gate was change from A51 to A38. Gate manager and staff handled customers badly. We were required to spend the night on airport and return home on another flight which cost me $3000 one way ticket much higher than my original return flight."
326," West Palm Beach to Dallas. Wish I never dedicated myself to this airline. You spend as much time on the ground experiencing mechanical issues, gate issues and lack of crew showing up. I had my company fly me on Delta and United the last 3 months - 3 issues out of 22 flights amongst these two carriers. I’m on my 6th flight back on American, out of the six 2 delays (45 mins or more and one cancellation). I only write this because I’m stuck on this airline as Executive Platinum, don’t get stuck like me - I love the first-class upgrades but other carriers 10 times more reliable offer the same. Good luck!"
327,"Not Verified | Toronto to Ft. Smith via Dallas. American Airlines is by far the worst airline out there. Absolutely everything is subpar. Service, flight attendants, flight delays. You name it, it's bad. I'm currently sitting through a three-hour delay and not getting home until tomorrow morning. This happened with my last flight as well. Never flying with them again."
328,"Not Verified |  I booked a family trip originally on December 3 for our family of 7 with an infant to Portland out of Detroit, Mi. It was schedule to leave out of Detroit at 6:10 am with a short layover in Charlotte, NC and arrive in Portland 12:06 pm. Not bad, 6 hours and we would have been to our destination. Early in 2019 American Airlines informs me that they had randomly re-booked our trip to some ridiculous 12-14 hour journey with 6 plus hour lay overs. I spent an hour or so on the phone with a representative to re-book new flights for all of us that made more sense. Our first flight was delayed due to Maintenance issues that caused us to have to re-book because of a missed connection in Chicago. We now had to fly from Chicago to Philadelphia and then to Portland. The flight out of Chicago, was also delayed due to maintenance issues which caused us to miss our connection to Philadelphia on flight. We had to rebook again to a later flight which put us in Portland Maine finally at around 11 pm. I contacted American Airlines about my complaint and wanted to give me 100 dollar voucher with no apology! Honestly $100 voucher is not worth the risk of giving American Airlines another opportunity."
329,Not Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to San Diego. Here we go again on American airlines plane issues my wife's entire trip has been a joke. If she ever makes home trust and believe we'll never fly this airline again. Since I work at DFW I see this all day every day. Wake up America stop flying with this joke of a company.
330,"Not Verified |  This review has nothing to do with my last flight. It has to do with the inflexibility of American Airlines with their customers. The American Airlines employees are very rude and very unwilling to help. They will immediately react in a negative way when a customer tries to receive a little flexibility. In this case I am having to cancel a trip due to Hurricane Dorian which is hitting Puerto Rico tomorrow and coming to Miami this weekend. My trip was with another executive who also had to cancel his trip due to his flight leaving from PR. I called AA and only asked them to honor my ticket for another time this year and they denied my request. My trip was due to return this coming weekend of 08/30/19 at the exact time the storm or hurricane will be passing through Miami, Florida. The two employees and the supervisor we spoke with in order to resolve this were very uninterested in helping us resolve this issue. What I see is that American Airlines does not care about the clients and does not respect loyalty to their company and brand. All they care about is squeezing the last dollar amount that a client may have when a bad situation like this comes about. I can honestly say that American Airlines is probably the worst airline in the US because they do not value their customers. "
331,"Not Verified |  American Airlines knew a bunch of us were going to miss the flight to PCB, FL due to bad weather in Dallas Fort-Worth and the plane left regardless. The next flight was 8 hours later! You would think they could have held the plane a few minutes longer allowing us to get on. Rebooking was a long and tedious process. I had to call, it wasn't automatic. They have no concern for paying customers."
332,"  Booked a first class ticket from Dallas to Orlando on August 22 for $1K with American Airlines. Called to see if I could change the departure date 1 day earlier, same flight. Customer Service said it would be $300 additional for price difference in flight and change fee. You would think that at some point, the company would get it. That they would value their customers. However, the continue to do things that defy logic while solidifying their extremely low rankings among their competitors. I will continue to fly Southwest Airlines as much as possible going forward while insisting my 100 employees do the same."
333,"Not Verified |  I booked a flight from Philadelphia to Martha's Vineyard. I had to get a connecting flight in Boston to Martha's Vineyard. I bought the ticket online - American Airlines I'm assuming chose the times the connecting flight would depart. Cape Air staff was friendly, and even though I was terrified at times by the size of the plane, I made it to Boston on my way home to Philadelphia. The complaint I have is the ticket American sold me allowed for 50 minutes to get off Cape Air, run through the airport in Boston, go through the lines at security, and run to the departing gate. I asked four American Airlines employees where I needed to go and they all told me something different. One woman took my boarding pass, logged the number into the kiosk and told me my flight had already left. She then told me to talk to a second lady behind the counter who asked me for my boarding pass and when I turned and asked the fiirst lady for it she said she didn't have it. It was crumpled up in her hand. I told her she had my boarding pass in her hand and she denied it. I told her to look at the piece of crumpled paper in her hand and she then admitted it was my boarding pass?? Then both agents told me to go to security to see what they could do?? but insisted my flight to Philadelphia had departed. I explained what was happening to security. TSA rushed me through the lines (hateful looks from the other 200 people standing in line) and told me to run to get my flight. I almost had a heart attack running through the airport as I heard my name on a loud speaker for last call. I made it just as they were closing the doors. The flight attendants were great, but told me I was lucky because other people flying in from Martha's Vineyard missed the flight. They said they don't understand why American books flights with connecting flights when there is no possible way to make them. I want to thank the airline employee who told me Terminal B was ""all the way at the end of this hall"" when it wasn't even in the building (I had to go outside and cross the street to get to American's terminal). I want to thank the lady who crumbled up my boarding pass and then denied it was in her hand. I want thank the ticket agent who told me I had to go on stand-by for the next flight to Philadelphia when the flight I booked was still at the gate. And I want to thank every agent sitting at every information center that sent me to the wrong place. American Airlines needs to not book connecting flights if the consumer has no possible way of making the connecting flight!"
334,"  Miami to St Kitts. This might be the worst airline of all time. They overbook don’t have enough seats and then they had an overweight issue where people who bought tickets could not board the plane. This might be one of the worst airlines I have ever taken in my life. I will never in my life take this airline again. They do not care about you, all they want is money and they are money hungry."
335,"Not Verified |  Miami to St Lucia. Arrived in Miami at 9:15 am Suppose to fly out at 11:am- 3:00pm & finally boarding plane. Now they tell us our paid for assigned seats no longer apply. They had to get a new plane. Well, after sitting on the plane for 30 minutes so far They tell us now Maintenance hasn’t signed off on this plane! First time to St Lucia & American Airlines has ruined this trip. If we get off the ground today we will be flying to St Lucia at dark. Do not get to see the beauty of the island. Lost a day of vacation."
336,  Chicago to Dallas via Salt Lake City. For the second time in a row on a government flight booked through Government travel American Airlines has kept my bags at my point of origin This is the second time I’ve had to use American Airlines using this route beyond both times my bags did not arrive at my final destination. It is apparent to me that government travel baggage is not priority and is loaded on later flights when original flights are full. Both bags contained uniforms and military items I need for duty which begins tomorrow. As of 6 PM local time SLC today they have not even left Chicago. (I arrived in SLC at 1:30 PM) I would like to know American Airlines explanation for this. It seems to be a very common occurrence with service members. We service members have little choice in choosing airlines and American was chosen for me because of its contract rates over other carriers. This comes out a huge inconvenience since many service member’s do not have the luxury of individual transportation at their final destinations and many military destinations are far from city centers making airline driver deliveries a logistical challenge. My recommendation to military members traveling on airlines with government contract rates is to avoid American Airlines completely.
337,"  Chicago O’Hare to Miami. Plane was supposed to board at 6:06pm; doesn’t begin boarding until 6:28pm. Plane was supposed to take off at 6:41pm; plane wasn’t finished boarding until 7:05pm. After sitting for 15 minutes after boarding said plane, we’re notified that the flight is delayed 1 hour and 20 minutes due to mechanical problems. Still not sure if we’re going to be able to use said plane. I’m supposed to be on vacation. Wi-Fi on the plane doesn’t work, this flight can not earn points (for whatever reason), have not been offered even a drink. American sucks, should have read reviews before purchasing. Will not make the same mistake again."
338," San Francisco to Los Angeles with American Airlines. The flight attendants on this flight are always the worst kind of people. It’s as if they absolutely hate their job and take out all their anger on the customers. Rather than being helpful, they are short and abrupt. Would not recommend this airline to absolutely anyone. Try Southwest or Delta and you’ll get much nicer service. Remember American Airlines, try to smile every now and again."
339,Not Verified |  Worst service. Had one AA rep tell me he was to busy to speak with us. Delayed flights. Put on other flights that also were delayed so American Airlines wasted one day of our vacation. Then because we were group 9 to board they would not let us take our cary on. So now we have to go to baggage claim adding even more time to what has become a terrible experience. I will never fly American Airlines again.
340,"Not Verified |  We had the displeasure of flying with AA July 20, 2019 and July 25, 2019. Where do I begin? First, upon checking one bag, we were told, due to our bag exceeding fifty pounds, the cost would be $100. Our credit card was charged $130! No gate number was provided to us! We had to wander aimlessly and ask an AA representative, who was rude! All representatives were rude! We were told we could not board the plane after first class was called. (We had a service dog and a stroller). We were VIP seating! We were unable to access the AA WIFI once aboard the plane. Being in VIP seating, we asked if there was a charge for alcoholic beverages. We were told, yes! (On our return flight from LAS to CLT, we asked the flight attendant if there was a charge for alcoholic beverages. She also said, yes! The passenger sitting next to us, in the aisle seat, told and showed us that alcoholic beverages are free!) We don’t appreciate being lied to! Once we arrived in CLT, we were told there was a 3 hour delay! We had pre-paid tickets for a show in Las Vegas at 9.00pm that cost us $204.88 and were non-refundable! We understand that weather conditions are not in anyone’s control, however, we were not offered any compensation for the money and our valuable waiting time that were out! We encountered the same no WIFI and no alcohol from CLT to LAS! What happened to the good ole days where there were screens to view movies (with provided ear/head-phones), actual meals and a variety of snacks (that were included, not a charge for) as well as friendly and calm flight attendants? We flew with this airline this past Easter and had a positive experience. That is why we chose to fly with AA again. Bad mistake! Wish we flew with Southwest! This truly was the traveling nightmare we had to endure!"
341,"  Paris to Los Angeles via Dallas. They just cannot get anything right. Flew from Paris to-day but couldn't check-in and spent one hour over the telephone while they figured out how to reissue the ticket (schedule change). When I checked in again this problem and even though I am AA Platinum elite they charge me 50€ for my suitcase even though am supposed to get two complimentary (https://www.oneworld.com/travel-benefits). Because I couldn't check-in of course got the lousiest seats. Why because the computer told them to collect it and they cannot override the computer. It seems that the computer is not their tool, but they are the tool of the computer. Upstairs was treated abrasively by a 22-year old boy in the Admirals' Club - why does American continue to hire people who do not wish to serve the public? In my opinion AA is deceptive & dishonest and now they do not honour their pledges regarding elite benefits. I plan to sue them in Superior Court for the $55 just because someone has to send them a message that they cannot walk all over people. It is astonishing though how they cheat everyone even their best customers."
342,  6:40 New York JFK to Austin flight delayed 80 min. Since it was taken off after 8pm they did not serve dinner! Same thing on the way back to New York happened. 6:30 flight delayed 90 min and announced dinner will not be served but snack meal. Waste of time and waste of money. Last time flying with American Airlines. Not recommended at any time.
343,  Ashville to Philadelphia. Worst airline ever. Our flight was randomly cancelled due to air traffic where other flights were flying as scheduled to Philly. No compensation for money lost on fuel and hotel bookings. Avoid this airline! They had it planned and let it happen at the last minute. They could find an alternative solution. Avoid!
344,"Not Verified |  On our way there, our boarding passes said to go to the kiosk for seat assignments. At the kiosk no one acknowledged us for 30 minutes as they were talking amongst themselves and finally when someone looked up they asked “are you looking for your seat assignments” we stated yes, and the reply we got was “well so is everybody else”. Absolutely terrible. Then on the way home, our flight got delayed. The delay would cause us to miss our connector flight so with everyone else we stood in line to talk to the employees at the kiosk. While in line, a member of American Airlines passed out a number to call. We called the number just to ask about flight changes and if we could get a refund how that would work. The women on the phone informed us that we would have to do that online which we said we would wait to talk to the employees first. After standing in line for 2 hours to talk to the person at the kiosk about our options, they told us we had cancelled our flight by talking to that women on the phone. The man at the kiosk told us “there’s nothing I can do” and “I wish you wouldn’t have called them”. So we walked away with no flight home, no one to help, and lord only knows if we will get our refund. This is so ridiculous. Awful airline and will never fly with American Airlines again."
345," Received morning email that everything was good to go. Went thru security at 7.30 for a 9.30 flight to Dallas FW. So the nightmare and incompetence begins. The flight was cancelled. Everything was rescheduled. I would now fly to LAX at 5.30 pm, an 8 hour delay - they gave us a $12 food voucher. I went to the American Airlines counter to tell them I would miss my flight in Manila and they just basically said it was my problem and I would have to call the airlines. My flight in Manila was scheduled for 7.5 hours after I was supposed to arrive on my American Airlines booked trip. Now in LA, I am put on Philippine Airlines, which runs about 30 minutes late after another 2.5 hour layover. So, now I am in Manila, at the wrong terminal, as I was supposed to be on an American Airlines flight that arrived at the correct terminal. Its not really a big deal as I don't have my luggage. 3-4 day delay and I have to go back to the airport to get it! Never again American Airlines. 33 hours and now I'm sitting in a bus terminal at the airport waiting to go to the correct terminal hoping Cebu Pacific takes pity on me and gets me to my destination cause American Airlines did absolutely nothing for not only me but their other customers on that flight. Pathetic."
346," The service on board was surprisingly and completely unexpectedly quite good. However, the managing of bags was terrible. I checked two bags in LA at the same time and when arriving in MEX only one was there. At first at the AA baggage loss counter, they seemed very sympathetic and gave the impression I might get it back in 24 hours as they say in most instances it is the case. But after calling each day with the same promise that the baggage was scanned and in LA, they promised it would arrive in MEX the next day to no avail. On the 15 August, I was told by one staff of the lost baggage phone line my luggage was already on the plane and would arrive at my doorstep by 8pm. At 9pm I call just to be informed that my bag was still in LA. That is not incompetence, that is plain lying. I have to wait until 18 August to receive it back and no compensation was granted. It goes without saying that this was the worst customer service I have ever experienced from any airline."
347,"Not Verified |  Denver to Philadelphia. Arrived at Denver Airport 1 1/2 hours prior to 5:24 am departure. Stood inline for nearly 55 minutes at self service checkin. AA counter was moving people from the back of the line to the front of the line in order to keep them from missing their 5:00 AM flight (this caused us to have to run to our gate missing any chance of getting food before boarding). We were sitting near the back of the plane, by the time the service cart got to us, they had one sandwich and two fruit trays left. My son and I originally wanted a sandwich each. He pulled out the sandwich and the fruit trays. I said I would take one of both. The flight attendant from the front of the plane came up and asked for the two fruit trays, my flight attendant literally gave her both. His explanation was the “front of the plane” has priority over the back of the plane. This is absolutely unacceptable. I sent a note to AA and have been ignored. Bottom Line, if AA think they are a doing a good job, they are not. I will continue to tell people my experience and steer them away from flying American Airlines!"
348,  Philadelphia to Las Vegas. Pay more and take a different airline. Sat on the plane for four hours and then flight was cancelled. Rescheduled for a flight 24 hours later. One day out of a three day vacation gone. Next day flight had a three hour layover that turned into four because of a delayed flight. People coming off the flying were running each other over trying to get to connecting flights only to be told the flights took off and they needed to go to customer service to reschedule. No organization with the airline staff or traffic control in Philadelphia. Will be waiting for compensation after this. Will never fly with AA again!
349,"  My daughter and I were about to go to Miami see a specialist for my daughter’s condition. The ticket agent said we had time to run to the bathroom, but when we returned, that same ticket agent watched us approach, rushed to shut the door to the ramp and almost gleefully told us “sorry, you can’t board.” We inquired as to what to do next, and she said we could go stand-by. After waiting through 3 over-sold flights, we realized that there was no way we would board a flight to Miami going stand-by. We called American and the agent offered us two new flights at almost $400 a piece without any credit for the more than $300 we’d already paid for the original flight. I called United and a great guy got us on another flight the following morning for only $140 total for the two of us. While in Miami, my daughter became very ill and was hospitalized for 4 days. The doctor would not release her from his care in time for our flight. I called American and explained the situation. They offered to “help” us, but they would have to charge a “change’ fee to the tune of $480! After many failed conversations with American Airlines, I gave up. I felt like we were being extorted. We were stranded and nearly broke through no fault of our own and they would not budge an inch to give us a reasonable flight. I called Southwest airlines. They gave us a flight home for little more than $168 a piece, which was much less than American’s “change” fee. When I complained on Twitter, they began to direct message me, (anything to keep my more than 3000 followers from knowing how awful we were being treated.) The last one read, “We’re very sorry for the situation. We feel it was outside the norm and for that reason we hope you’ll allow us another chance in the future.” Still no offer of compensation for the more than $700 they pocketed from us. And, when I read other former customer’s experiences, it seems this is exactly their norm! I will never fly American Airlines again. Their staff, especially their O’Hare staff, are obnoxious and rude. I can’t remember being treated so badly by a company whose service I paid for! Deplorable customer service!"
350,"Not Verified | Phoenix to Houston IAH. My back still hurts from flying yesterday. These are the most cramped seats and without back support, I've ever flown in. Pay a little more and fly another airline"
351,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Chattanooga. My flight was scheduled for 8:27pm. I get to the gate at 8.20pm to find the gate is closed! I go to customer service and they said ""oh, flights leave 10 minutes ahead of time "" I go where does it say that? I've never heard of this? "" Its common knowledge"" Airlines know who is supposed to be on the flight, you know you are missing someone but you leave early anyway? The worst part was their attitude! I asked to speak to a supervisor and he was unprofessional. I said nothing I had says flight leaves 10 minutes early, I looked at departure time on kiosk, 827!  He said the kiosk says it, I went and looked and took pictures, it does not say to be there 10 mins early. I have never seen anything like this."
352,"  We bought some tickets from Boston to Washington, for a flight scheduled at 8.00 pm on 08.15. Two months before our trip, we received an email saying our flight will be at 9.00 pm. First bad news. The day of our trip, we received an e-mail at 8.30 pm rescheduling our flight at 10.30 pm. All night long, we received 8 e-mails rescheduling our flight! And no information at all from American Airlines crew at the airport! We didn't know anything : nor why it was delayed, nor why it was rescheduled every half hour. It was freezing in the airport because of the air conditionner, and nobody gave us blankets at any point. We were just waiting and waiting for the next bad news and the next email in our mailbox. At some point, my friends and I went to look for some company member but nobody was at the desk, although it was 11.35 pm and the flight was supposed to leave. We finally managed to find someone who explained us there was no pilot for our flight. How can it be possible? Our flight finally left Boston at 1.30 am with more than 4 delayed hours, and the staff told us there was nothing they could do for us. Even one of the employees was chocked by the situation! This is how American Airlines treats their customers. Because, obviously, customers didn't receive any compensation for all the troubles caused. Just a ""we apologize"". We lost 7 hours at the airport and we lost a lot of money because our Airbnb in Washington couldn't wait for us all night long."
353,"  Hartford to Miami. Brand new airplane. They waited until all were seated. Upon pre-flight inspection, they discover that there’s a flat tire and they had no replacement. They announce that they are trying to borrow from another airline and that flight is delayed 45 minutes. Original departure time was 6am. Ten minutes later, stewards said we have no information so please do not ask us. 5 minutes later we get text message saying departure delayed until 9:30 am. Ten minutes later they say they still have no tire and no info but will need to deplane for repair. They also said “make one line in front of gate counter if transferring in Miami. We will hand you a card with a phone number to call regarding your transfer flight. When you deboard do not speak with other AA staff as they are busy with other flights”. Mind you, they are holding our luggage hostage so that we can’t make other arrangements. As we are deboarding, the sign at the gate changes to departure until 11:30. No one makes announcements from gate. Only announcement made was “If you’re not making a transfer in Miami get out of line! This is the only flight to Miami we have so you just have to wait” This is how they were speaking to us. No apologies, no kind words. Now, I had to get up at 3:00 am to make this flight. I booked an early flight because I was surprising my daughter on her birthday and had a whole day planned for celebration. As it is, I will only have 3 days with her counting today. I haven’t seen her in almost a year. She had a very difficult week which made me decide to bite the bullet and pay this high priced ticket for just a few days which is now turning into a nightmare. It is 7:30 am and still no announcements. I appreciate the safety check and making the necessary repairs, however, a new plane should not be without a spare tire and neither should the airline. This is what is causing the major delay and I do not appreciate the way we are being treated not to mention that I paid almost $500 for disappointment, a day lost, and complete rudeness! Not so much as a food voucher was offered. Next time, it’s Delta for me."
354," New York to Miami. If you want to pay for American Airlines and get Spirit Airlines service thats the only way you should travel with them. Delayed at every single flight no exception between 1 and 3 hours, no water no snacks, no going to the bathroom, just sit strapped in your seat until you get to depart, if you ever find out since the crew does not communicate with the passengers. This is my last trip with American Airlines, will change my miles membership and credit cards too, this is a absolute no no company to travel with. Sadly they have been decreasing quality since past 4 years, but the delays are just too frustrating."
355,"Not Verified |  Washington to Kansas City. Does American Airlines now have a policy to punish those who are not willing to pay for an earlier boarding? Sure seems that way. Went to board my plane yesterday, when group 7 was called to board, they suddenly had no more room in the overhead bins. They checked our bags at the gate. When we got onto the plane, there were empty overhead compartments everywhere. There was plenty of space. It seems as though you must pay to board early or you now have to face the fact of going to baggage claim to get your luggage. You certainly cannot risk complaining, what would happen if you did? You will be removed or arrested? I am not poor, but I was poor at one time and did not have the money to pay for 'boarding earlier'. There is something sickening about this unethical behavior."
356,"  Worst flight ever. When you use your miles with them they sit you in the back row next to toilets and next Non-parented children. Stewardess was flirting with man in front of us, but what’s worse is that she wasn’t keeping the two non parented 7-9 year old children who were so out of control. Kicking the seat, throwing food, snatching our phones from our hands, and just all over the place. Bad bad bad! Don’t fly this airline.  Not flying this airline again. "
357,  Terrible airline. Delay after delay after delay. All accompanied by their ‘we are sorry for the inconvenience’ email. They’re not sorry. They’re laughing all the way to the bank. Never again.
358,"  Worst airline my family and I have ever been on. Delays going to our destination and delays on the way back. They have no care for customer convenience, the crew was late and therefore delayed two hours. Then again on our way back home there were other unexplainable issues causing further delays. We had to sleep at the airport overnight and they could not/ did not want to accommodate us at all. Also once at Dallas Forth Worth, they kept changing our gates from one end to another, we kept having to walk up and down like 4 time! Worst flight experience ever. Get more for your money and fly another airline, United is the best."
359,"  Miserable experience on AA133 from Dublin to Dallas/Fort Worth on Sunday, June 9, 2019. My fiancé and I sat in front of a2 year old who kicked our seats and screamed for 6 of the 8 hour flight. We were very sympathetic to the mother of the child and asked crew to move to a wide open row toward back of plane but were told it was blocked for them to rest. I understand that particular aircraft has a separate designated crew rest area. Why would they also block an entire row? This is but one cause of my eroding confidence in our future travel with AA. On our way to Europe on the flight from DFW to New Orleans on AA (BA5269) May 23,2019, our AA flight attendant appeared angry and spoke to flyers as little as possible. She was abrupt and outright irritated when I asked for water during normal service times. Contrast this is the cabin service we received on BA and then Aegean in Europe and it provided a strong reason to look elsewhere when flying. Upon return, I sent a message via twitter and AA’s response was outright dismissive. After asking around to frequent business travelers, I was told AA has the reputation of terrible customer service. I’m now actively avoiding AA."
360,  Dallas to Boston. American Airlines has the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. I’ve had issues flying with them before but never anything bad enough to write a review. My flight was delayed and I was reassured that all flights from DFW were also on hold. I arrive at the gate only to find that the plane has actually left early!! Not to mention the gate had changed without notice! I tried to remain calm as this was my first missed flight ever but the gate attendants were unbelievably cruel to me in my panic. They hatefully pointed me toward the customer service area and I waited in line there for a little over an hour and I was simply given another flight  standby with more rudeness from the attendant because I had questions she couldn’t answer. I personally will never fly AA again but good luck!
361," Miami to Nashville. I have always had a terrible experience with American Airlines. My wife has been asked to give up her seat and be left behind while we were already sitting in 2015. I am currently writing this review while waiting on a flight that has been delayed 5 different times and have been sitting here for 4 hours on a 45 minute layover. They gave us some free crackers to apologize. I have had a pleasant experience a time or two, but unfortunately this seems to be par for the course for those of us that give this airline second chances."
362," This was a flight from Dallas to London as part of a Sydney-Dallas-London-Sydney trip on One World. AA have lifted their game (in my opinion) and the flight was smooth, on time and totally uneventful. The IFE is really great so made use of it a lot. The FA's are best described as courteous but not warm. Swift in getting things served up for the overnight leg and then retired not to be seen again. No matter. Had eaten in the lounge so did not eat anything on board which looked pretty much regulation fare. Comfort wise it was OK and decent leg room for an economy cabin. AA get a bad rap but here is a big shout out for them in all regards from check in through to getting off the plane."
363,"  I’ve never been more upset and disappointed in an airline. Ever. I’m a regular flyer but this is my first time flying American. They didn’t have great reviews but I thought, hey, this is a straightforward flight in the middle of the summer. Nope! I was delayed at SLC due to something in Chicago that passed in 15 minutes but delayed us for an hour and a half. I missed my connecting flight by 10 minutes. The girls and the counter had no idea what was going on or how to help me and the flight attendant when I got on the plane was absolutely clueless too and told me to call customer service? In the air or? It was a small flight (less than 20 people), they could have held the plane or at least tried. When I got to Chicago, they told me they couldn’t put me up for the night and to use a hotel discount. The discount was available / didn’t work and I was on hold for 30 minutes before I just got my own hotel! Then, in the morning, I finally board my plane and am headed to my destination. 20 minutes of sitting on the plane later the captain gets on the speaker and says the plane has maintenance issues and we have to get off and wait another hour and a half for a different plane! The front desk and flight attendants didn’t even know what was going on. I go home every 3 years and had an extremely important family event to attend, and missed it completely. I’m so upset at American. This flight was very expensive and I paid readily so I could get home on time. Shame on you for not giving any cares about the actual people who try to support your flights."
364,"  I don't normally leave reviews, but my experience was so awful that I felt compelled to write something. I had a flight leaving from Toronto to Richmond, for which I had no checked luggage. I was unable to check in online and had to do so at the Airport. I got to the Airport with 45 minutes left before check in closed and tried to use my passport on the self serve kiosk, which took forever to process and kept giving me an error. I tried a few more times and kept getting an error before one of the attendants said i should go to the desk for processing. I had to wait in line for what seemed like an eternity and once I got to the desk I was told that final check in time had passed and I could not board. I was shocked, and explained to the staff that I was here before check in time and had tried to use the terminals and was eventually sent into the line, and that normally my passport works at the kiosk, so this was my first time with any such issue. I asked if there is anyway that an exception can be made, I still have 45minutes before the flight boards and I need to make my flight, it was not fair that I cant board when I was here before check in time. The attendant was unsympathetic and very rude and basically said no there is nothing we can do, you're supposed to be here 3 hours before your flight and its too late to board as per her discussion with her manager. They told me I can rebook but it would cost me $800 to leave the next day but that all they can do. I had to rebook myself on another airline, but the only silver lining here was I did request and receive a refund from American Airlines for my missed flight. However, I do not intend to fly with them again anytime soon."
365,Not Verified |  I have never been treated so rude in my life. My family flew into Lake Charles Louisiana for a family reunion on August 9th and we were scheduled to fly out of Lake Charles on August 11th at 4:25pm. We were lost and ended up getting to the airport at 4pm. There was no line and no wait being that it was a small airport. There was no attendant at the check in station. I immediately ran to security to get help as they had not started boarding our flight. The security guard came and informed us to go back downstairs to check in and that they would send someone to help us. They deliberately waited until the plane left to come help us. The attendant was very rude and told us we had cheap tickets and we would not be able to rebook them. She showed no sympathy or compassion. The attendants at United were more helpful than she was. I called the customer service line and the supervisor told us that we could not get a refund. My family including my 85 year old grandmother in a wheelchair now have to rent a car and drive all the way to Atlanta because there was no more available flights leaving Lake Charles for 2 days. I feel that the situation was handled poorly and that we were treated unfair.
366,  My flight was cancelled and I was only notified at the airport at self check in. I was rebooked for the following day and got a very insensitive attitude from the American Airlines customer service. Not an airline I will recommend based on customer care.
367,"  Athens to St. Louis via Chicago. American canceled our flight with about 6 hours' notice. The representative put us on another flight, but she failed to secure our tickets and within about 30 minutes, that flight was oversold. Another American rep put us on a different flight through Tel Aviv, JFK, Charlotte and finally St. Louis. However, she also failed to tell us there was absolutely no way the connection at Tel Aviv to JFK would be possible with the timeframe. We ended up (thankfully with about 11 others from the same flight) stuck with Israeli airport security overnight - who were not at all interested in providing any assistance. We finally were able to get on the phone again with yet another American representative who got us on another flight (all economy - when we paid extra for premium economy) to the states. We ended up spending 48 hours in airports - all to come back and find American isn't the least bit interested in providing any sort of customer service to try to make things better. Not good business at all."
368,"  Dallas to Miami. Truly the worst airline. They don’t care if you have to change a flight (just buy a new ticket duh). There alre always delays. It’s not a friendly atmosphere and the flight attendants always look miserable. I always dread flying with them. I fly SW whenever possible. AA, time to consider your customers. Getting too big for your britches."
369,"  
Phoenix to Sacramento. On our original flight to our destination our plane was switched gates six times and it was delayed 4+ times and resulted in us missing our connection flight and our cruise. On our flight home our gate was switched another 3 times to completely different terminals across the airport and delayed two hours. It was the worst experience we ever had, will definitely NOT be flying American Airlines again."
370,"  Honolulu to Los Angeles. We had a flight canceled and they rebooked us on the next mornings flight and gave us a hotel, meal vouchers, and taxi cab to and from the airport. It was a really nice hotel too."
371,"Not Verified |  I've never been a big fan of AA, but after my most recent experience I'm absolutely disheartening and disgusted. For those that don't know, the company policy is to shut off the boarding system 30 minutes before take-off. I usually fly out of a small town airport, so it doesn't take me long to get through TSA and boarded... So I got a lovely surprise when I couldn't get on the plane. Apparently, I was just cut off by a couple of minutes. And instead of helping me reschedule my flight (even to another day), the lady had to put me on standby (another company policy for 'missed flights') - so I wasn't even ever guaranteed any flight and had to sit in the airport for hours waiting, continually going back to the desk to get a new standby ticket for a new flight. This policy is not okay. Plane tickets are expensive and people's time is priceless. In addition, when all the hullababo was over, I still could have gotten through TSA in time to get on the flight. That was the most heartbreaking part. In addition, the woman next to me was also late, and the clerk at the desk was absolutely rude to her. He spoke in a very condescending tone of voice. He said things like: ""you missed the same flight yesterday,"" ""I guess it just wasn't meant to be then,"" and ""you need to understand that you should be at the airport ready for your flight two hours before!"" (Note: usually I agree with this advise-- but not in a rude way like the clerk said it or for a very small airport like Bangor!). I get it, it's not an easy job and people are annoying-- I have worked in service, too! But if you can't handle people without being mean, find another job! It was super uncomfortable being next to her and having to listen to his rudeness - imagine how she feels! Rude service, bad policy, and a generally uncomfortable flying experience. It's with the extra money for Delta. Treat yourself and avoid the hastle!"
372,  Harrisburg to Albuquerque. Extremely rude from check in to flight attendant. I just want to go back to Southwest. I have to take 2 more planes on this airline before I get home and I’m dreading it. A nice word or a smile goes a long way. These people don’t care.
373,"  This is the worst experience I have ever had flying, hands down the worst. I arrived at LaGuardia in NY at 7 am and had a connector flight to Richmond, VA. 30 minutes before boarding they came over intercom and said that the flight was completely cancelled, not delayed but completely cancelled. The reason, because the had to much air traffic i.e. they overbooked. They put me on next flight, at 9 pm. I asked for other options and they give no one options. They were very unprofessional throughout the whole process, laughing and joking with each other. When asked for a meal ticket they were reluctant to even give me that even though it was there fault that they were over booked. This happens apparently 4 times a week on this connection alone and yet American continues to screw people over with no remorse. One of the customers had to get his 10 year old son to doctor in Richmond and they still didnt make accommodations for him. Now it is 9 pm and we were supposed to board at 8:45 pm but low and behold it is late and wont be here until 9:36 pm. This airline is pure trash and I dont recommend.  I hope the upper management reads this and strongly looks at how they choose to operate their business and not continue to screw people over. I will never ever never ever use their airline and I hope that jobs are lost over this post."
374,  This was the worst airline ever. They change my times eight times at least before we got to get on our flight in one day. When we finally got on our flight the plane was sitting there for at least 30 minutes. They said it was due to weather but the weather was up north and the airport was still clear. I had a connecting flight in Chicago and the Chicago plane was with American Airlines again and they were an hour late so my new time to fly was 9:02 and we arrived at 9:20 and I saw my flight still at the gate but they wouldn’t let me in because they close the gate. They told me that I can reschedule to tomorrow since it was too late at night. They wouldn’t pay for a hotel or they wouldn’t even pay for a little bit for food. They didn’t even apologize or anything they just told me that it wasn’t their fault. It was not a good customer service and i was really disappointed.
375,"  Seoul to Dallas Fort Worth. I contacted the customer relation and been emailing back and forth with them regarding the situation that my family and I had came across on July 30,2019. All we get back in response was an apologize and a reply kept saying thank you for our feedback and they will use this feedback to improve. I am very disappointed with AA. When we arrived at ICN airport from Vietnam, we were greeted by ICN staff at our gate as we landed. The staff helped all the passenger that is flying to Dallas on the flight AA0280 to get to the gate as soon as possible so we wouldn’t be late for our departure. There was 29-39 of us running across every terminals along with the staff trying to rush. The staff even called AA staff from the gate to let them know we’re on the way. As we arrived at the gate with AA0280, there was about 25 more minutes to departure but AA refused to let anyone from our flight onto AA. Their reasoning was unacceptable! They said we’re late and we have no document from our previous flight stating why we were late. There was other individuals passenger from a different flight was still able to get on board with AA. They allowed those individuals but not anyone from flight KE0686. We were not late for our flight with AA and their gate was still open. We were treated unfairly and their reasoning was unacceptable. My family and I brought our tickets with AA with a reserved seats. They had no reason to refuse to let us on unless they gave up our seating without our permission. AA is known for overbooking passengers on their flight.  The flight we brought is from Korean to Dallas but they exchanged our ticket from Korea to San Francisco to Dallas. We had to recheck all our luggage again at San Francisco. All the trouble they put us through was not right. We did not brought our ticket to go through all this trouble. We were suppose to work that morning that we arrived on 7/31/19 but because we were so overwhelmed and exhausted from all the trouble that AA put us through we were not able to make it to work. AA is not taking responsible for their wrong. They said our flight was late, which it was not late for AA. If we were late, why are other passengers able to get on 10 minutes after us? Something doesn’t sound right. “Under the federal rules, passenger is entitled to cash compensation, not just a voucher, and a seat for a later on flight. According to U.S, we have laws that they are forced to pay those.”  I tried to explained to AA but they refused to take action for their wrongs. I even attached a video clip of almost all the people that kept behind that was on the same flight as my family and I. On behalf of my family and I and also 29-39 other passengers, AA need to be responsible for this. This is their fault for either overbooking or giving up our seats. I will contact the head leader of AA as well. We will not be flying with AA anymore after this situation. It’s unacceptable!"
376,"  While on my connecting flight from Dallas Forth Worth to McAllen my flight was delayed multiple times then completely canceled without an explanation. I went to customer service and was put on a stand by list with 44 other people, which is ridiculous! How can they allow that many people on a stand by list. Long story short I was not allowed to get on that flight either and end up spending the night at the airport trying to figure out a way home. Eventually I was allowed to board on a flight to another city close to home at around midnight, but the situation and customer service was ridiculous. I will never fly with them again."
377,Not Verified |  San Antonio to Phoenix. I am a disabled vet with PTSD. I was willing to pay extra when I checked in to make sure we had our seats together. I have horrible anxiety the person who helped me said it was not necessary that it would be taken care of at the gate. At the gate I was told sorry can't do nothing. Additionally they over booked the flight and we volunteer to be rebooked on another flight and still would not seat us together.
378,"  LaGuardia to Richmond. Just flew in from Japan, 10 hour layover just to have my flight canceled 1 hour before take off because this sorry excuse of a company knowingly overbooked / oversold tickets and openly admitted it. The most un-professional/unorganized company I’ve ever felt with. Are kids running this place? Is this a joke? I don’t care if I have to pay $500 extra dollars for a ticket with another airline I will never use this company again."
379,  Ft Lauderdale to Augusta via Charlotte. Booking my flight was so easy. I talk to Jermaine on the phone with customer service and he made booking my flight with my voucher very easily! He made me feel like I was talking to a friend on the phone. He had great customer service skills.
380,"  
Mexico City to Los Angeles. American Airlines has charged my credit card twice for services that I never received. In early 2018, I was charged $96.12 to upgrade my mother’s seat on a flight. However, on that flight, AA did not upgrade her seat.  Recently in July 2019, the same thing happened. I tried to upgrade my mother’s and my seat on an international trip, a birthday gift to my dear mother. For some reason, they upgraded mine but not my mother’s. It was a huge inconvenience for my 89 year old mother and me to seat separately for the 5 hour flight (on the upside, they let my mother have the upgrade while I sat in economy). A couple weeks later, I happened to check my credit card account and saw that AA had assessed two charges of $200.20 each, even though they only upgraded my ticket and not my mother’s.  When I mentioned my fear of being overcharged based on my previous experience, the airport representative who helped check us in assured me that I would not be charged for the upgrade that was not allowed. Also, I was only given a receipt for one upgrade of $200.20. On both occasions, I only discovered the inappropriate charges weeks later while checking my credit card statements (which I honestly don’t do often but must try to from now on). If I had not discovered the charges, AA would probably not have reimbursed me! Second, AA did not have the courtesy to issue any apology whatsoever on either occasion for the overcharge! AA’s conduct is an unacceptable business practice and should be looked into. I don’t consider my experiences to be isolated incidents. Once my points are used up, I will not fly with AA."
381,  Philadelphia to Burlington. Terrible. Multiple delays. Bounced us back from different terminals all day. No updates provided to us. The airline representatives are cranky and annoyed. This is the most terrible airline in existence. The only reason I fly is because it is a hub airport for where I live.
382,"Not Verified |  Toronto to Charlotte. I don’t know what is going on with this airline. They have no minimum respect at all to their customers. This was my first and last time to fly with it, my flight was supposed to be at 7:30 am, I received more than 6 flight delay emails and at the end the flight was cancelled. "
383,"Not Verified |  On the way home (July 29, 2019), our ticket said boarding at 6:44pm. We were sitting at the gate next to the boarding gate (no room left for sitting in our gate). There were zero calls about the flight heard over the entire airport (later verified when we did get to go home, the attendants were calling out flight numbers but they were only heard in the gate area). We went to the gate at 6:35pm and were not spoken to until 6:37pm when the attendant informed us we could not board our plane as it was closed 10 minutes prior to departure. I asked when departure was and she said 6:54pm. So, it was 17 minutes prior to departure. Then she said, well it is international so we board 15 minutes early. Ok, well our ticket said 6:44pm which was 10 minutes, she said 15 minutes which would have been 6:39pm. Either way, we were there 'on time' and were not given any explanation as to why and our 'new' flight was not until the next day. First, this is unacceptable. The fact is we were on time. Second, the attendant was extremely rude. Third, it is your fault we were not on board and we had to find our own accommodations because of your mistake. Fourth, we were not able to have our luggage. So no medications, clothes or toiletries and stay another night. For these reasons I would not recommend booking a flight with American Airlines ever. Also, when we were trying to figure out a place to stay, some other folks came and shared similar bad experiences and recommended to never fly AA again. Lastly, we are frequent flyers and know many more."
384,"Not Verified |  Charlotte to St. Thomas. I was to board with group nine, yet after boarding group seven, no other groups were called. This flight had been delayed already, so I waited a minute, then went to the counter at the gate to ask when I would be boarding. I was told that the plane was full and given a ticket for the next day. I went to the counter the next day and the rude agent said that I was not in the system and that there was no way what happened to me happened. I was given a standby ticket, despite having a seat before. I will never fly American again."
385,"Not Verified |  San Francisco to Oklahoma City. American Airlines doesn't value their customers and I will never fly with them again. We had a 45 minute wait between connecting flights but that was altered due to late departure, late arrival, and a customer who had a medical emergency. We missed our connecting flight due to these circumstances which are out of my control. The airline had the opportunity to hold up our connecting flight which Delta did for customers when we flew earlier in the week, but did not. I waited in line with approximately 30 unhappy customers who shared similar horror stories to mine. I also love the fact that Delta allows military to board early while American does not. I will fly Southwest and Delta from now on."
386,"  I was less than thrilled to have spent $300 for an unaccompanied minor ticket for my 14 year old, 6’1, 200 lb son who has a cell phone to call me if he encounters a problem. Instead he was treated like a baby being made to wear a lanyard around his neck and a hospital type plastic wristband. I had to call an agent to purchase the ticket, but at no point during that conversation was it explained to me that he was I had to wait until the flight took off, so I left as soon as he boarded the plane. I was then chased down by the rudest employee who proceeded to yell at me. When I asked what his name was, he would only tell me Frank and said he was the manager, but refused to give me his last name. I am so glad I was forced to pay double the cost of a normal flight, only to not be informed about staying an extra hour and then be treated like a criminal for trying to get back to the rest of my family. American Airlines, I think I am capable of making the decision as to whether or not I think my child needs your services, which were really, my services."
387,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Salt Lake City. In 4 flights with them this week, we waited for the pilots on all of them, each flight we had major waiting. We missed our connection because we sat on the plane for 1+ hour after we left. Will never fly again on them. I have never been treated so poorly by a company."
388,"  Los Angeles to Miami. The ticket agents at gate 50A for flight AA1268 we’re extremely rude and unfair in regards to our carry on luggage. She ask to put our luggage in the luggage size verification to see if it fits and it fit perfectly! Nothing was hanging out but she said because it looks too tight in the cage it’s not the legal size and forced us to check our carry on in. We watched all these other carry on bags bigger than ours go bye without them being stopped, I feel like we were being discriminated because we were the only ones being singled out for our carry on size. We’ve flown with this carry on 1000x and never had issues. This is the last time I will ever fly American Airlines. And the more I recall it, almost all my AA flight experiences have been horrific."
389,"Not Verified |  Every time I fly with American Airlines I have a problem. Especially if I fly through Chicago O’Hare Airport. This time what happened was that the previous flight in my gate (to Atlanta) could not fly their plane. So, American Airlines decided that after nearly 24 hours of traveling from Spain, the flight going to Atlanta would take the plane going to Denver (at around 8-8:30 pm) and I would have to fly at 11:30 pm CDT and get to Denver at 2:30 pm MDT. Let’s just say it was not worth and I am neither going with American Airlines nor through Chicago O’Hare."
390,  Richmond to Denver. We got the run around for hours. Never made it to our destination. It took 14 hours to get them to finally get them to get us a return flight home. We got told several things and hand to hassle to get the right answer and help. Never again would I put my family on American.
391,  Miami to Philadelphia. Took a chance on this airline even after all the issues families and friends have had. Had no trouble from PHL-MIA. Trying to fly home flight was delayed 3 times and we are still waiting for a plane. Never flying this airline again.
392,"Not Verified |  San Francisco to Phoenix. First of all, the service here was absolutely horrible. The woman checking my luggage was probably the most disrespectful person we encountered and I wish  I had gotten her name to report her. Absolutely rude, completely out of line, and knows nothing  about good customer service. When we got in line no one informed us of the first line we had to go through first, so after waiting in such a huge line, we were then rudely that we had to go back into the other line. They acted like it was our fault! Not only that but there were about 3 people working so you can imagine for yourself how long the line was for help on a weekend flight in San Francisco. Second, our flight was delayed before we had even gotten to the airport! We found out about it the morning of and we ourselves had to go and find a new flight! They completely expected us to miss our own flight that they were in charge of booking. Not only that it was a 3 hour delay which made us late to picking up our dog at the vet, so we had to pay for an extra night all thanks to the worst  airline our family has ever flown with. 110% do not recommend!"
393,"Not Verified |  First of all, I should state I was flying stand by. The whole way over to the airport there were 13 seats open in first class. We got to the airport and (not to mention) we were the first stand by people to check in. I guess it’s understandable we didn’t get first. Anyways, we start boarding the plane. May I add I’ve only flown Delta international never American. So, we board the plane and sit down in main cabin. I notice something weird. Huh there’s no movies screens. I shrugged it off and got my charger out. I was going to charge my phone but there weren’t any! I was kinda getting annoyed by this point cause there was already no inflight entertainment for the main cabin except using the app. But how are you supposed to do that if you don’t have chargers?! I took out the pillows and blankets. The blankets are expected to be the scratchy fabric. But the pillows shouldn’t even be called pillows! They are so flat and tiny, they provide no support. American only knows how to treat first class. We need to get what we paid for! Make our money worth it! I will never fly American internationally again."
394,Not Verified |  New York JFK to Dallas Ft Worth. This was the worst flight I ever took. They say to arrive at the airport 2 hours early which we did. I received an email at 3:59 that it was on time. Then I got an email at 4:59 that the flight was being delayed 5 hours. I was already checked in so that email didn’t help me. We sat in the airport for 7 hours with no explanation as to why this was happening. I will never fly American again.
395,"  Orlando to Charlotte. I’m in flight AA677 supposed to leave at 5:12pm, now it is 9:20 we’re inside the plane since 7pm, and we still here at the gate. Worst airline ever, this is my second bad - I mean really bad experience with this airline"
396,"Not Verified |  Dukuth to Charlotte via Chicago. This flight was an absolute joke. Flight 583 started off with mechanical issues and 1 hour delay in Duluth. Then got to Chicago, otw to Charlotte when 25 minutes away we hover because of storms. After a 90 minute delay we are diverted to Raleigh. This is a 2.5 hour drive from Charlotte. We arrive on the tarmac and sit there from 8:20 to 9:42. When finally allowed off the plane no one updates us till 1:22am and they had no pilot to fly back to Charlotte. I was flying due to my father having a stroke to start with, this was the flight back home after seeing him. My husband could of picked me up and driven back to Charlotte in the time we never got any updates. Instead he and our children had no idea when I would be home. I am writing this as I am just now getting on the plane to Charlotte, but told my husband to wait until we actually get in the air before heading to Charlotte Airport to pick me up. They have horrible customer service, never let us know anything, and finally over 90 minute wait on the phone to talk to anyone about the flight. I would hope that everyone on this flight gets a refund because it was not worth a penny."
397,"  Philadelphia to Orlando. A horrible experience, after waiting so long since 9:15 pm that the flight is supposed to leave on July 28, 2019. After we left late, waiting on the runway and waiting to take off we had to return to the gate because an indication came out that something happened on the right side of the plane. We were in that period of time more than 30 minutes inside the plane mounted waiting for them to say what was going to happened, they offered nothing during the wait inside the plane not even water. They decided that we should get off because they couldn't fix the plane, that they would be providing another plane for that flight. We got off and around 12 midnight they told us that the flight was canceled. They gave us nothing no voucher to eat or hotel, and on the flight that they accommodated us to leave it was the other day July 29 at 11am all those hours around 24 hours my husband and I had to stay at the airport without sleep waiting there until the time for our flight. I do not recommend this airline at all."
398,"  Manaus to Washington  via Miami. What a totally incompetent worthless company. Worse than spirit. Terrible booking system, terrible customer service. Poor  in flight food. We overpaid for a flight to get home to DC from Manaus at the time stated on our ticket. I had some meetings scheduled, had my dog to pick up from the kennel, among other life circumstances to be taken seriously by me, but not by American Airlines. Connecting flight was a mere 10 minutes late. Bags took forever to come out onto the carousel. All this and we still arrived at security to re check our bags with 25-30 minutes left before our next flight. But nope, they told us they cant allow us to go because our bags need to be checked 45 minutes prior to the flight, so they forced us to go on standy  all day long. Excuse me but we are here and the flight hasnt left yet and ive been in this situation before with other airlines and have been allowed to go through, or put on another flight with another airline, or been vouchers for food and other things. That is the LEAST that could be done given i paid money to arrive home at a given time and did everything i was supposed to do and am now effed because of other peoples incompetence. But nope they said all they can do is put me on standby and offered some chips and soda to supposedly make up for ruining my day and costing me literally hundreds of dollars. Thanks for nothing you worthless people."
399,"  Dallas to Las Vegas. Our flight times and gate number changed 11 times. We were to depart at 10:28 pm, we left at 01:45 am. With so many inconveniences, it should have been a free flight. Once on board we waited another 20 minutes for a manual to be delivered, I didn’t think that I would make it home today!"
400,"Not Verified |  On Tuesday, July 30, 2019 around 1 PM my family and I went to the bag check in and immediately the woman working there was being rude because she couldn’t find our names in the system. Eventually it was revealed that they changed our flight without notifying us. At first she says our tickets are non refundable but, eventually (about 30 mins later) her supervisor told her to fix the mistake and we finally moved on to the security check and then went to our gate. After about an hour and a half, our flight was delayed and then 20 minutes later it was CANCELLED. We had to get in line to rebook our flight but, almost immediately the flights leaving that night were all booked. We decided to stay on standby for the last flight that night but, of course that also didn’t work out. We asked to be put on the next flight out which would be @ 8 AM and they said we would be put on standby even though there were enough seats available on that flight. My father started insisting that they have to confirm our seats because we did not want to go through the stress of being standby again. Again, the customer service was absolutely horrible and a supervisor had to come in to make sure we got what we wanted. We left LGA that night at 10:30 PM. Mind you we didn’t get our checked in luggage back because they were all sent to ATL so we didn’t have clothes or anything essential. Our next flight was around 9 AM so we got to the airport around 6 AM. Nothing significant happened until it was time to start boarding. This lady took our tickets and said that everyone got a seat except my dad and he would not be allowed to board the plane. At this point I am so frustrated. We needed to get back home as soon as possible because we were traveling with my 92 year old grandfather. As soon as we asked how this could happen they lady at the desk is like “do not yell at me.” We didn’t yell at her but, she kept telling us to not yell so I eventually started yelling because this customer service was so so bad. I told her she needed to give my dad a seat right now and after a lot of arguing she did. We all got onto the plane and even the flight attendants were rude and acted like they didn’t really care."
401,"  Washington to Minneapolis St Paul. Delayed buy over an hour, speeded through check in and regular checks. Horrible service and no professional involvement."
402,Not Verified |  Austin to Phoenix with American Airlines. Rudest people to deal with. On hold with customer service for 1 hour and put me on hold to check something and I was put on hold for another 45 minutes. Wouldn’t hold delayed flight for my son for 7 minutes. They basically told him to sleep on the concrete floor for 12 hours until he can get connecting flight. Would never fly with them and will tell anyone and everyone how rude they are!
403,"  This airline's ok, other than the food. I flew on the Boeing 787 from Los Angeles to Tokyo. The crew were not the most friendly, with most of them not greeting us. They didn't look neat and clean. I even overheard one of them ask their colleagues, ""It's fried rice, right?"" Like that's ridiculous. When the fried rice arrived, it didn't even taste like rice. I don't even know how to describe it. It was just disgusting. The entertainment was fantastic though, as American has most of their movies up to date."
404," Manchester to Philadelphia with American Airlines. So today I had a flight that was delayed, no biggie. But they kept delaying it and emailing me different updates then on the board at the airport by hours. At the end I would have missed my over 3 hour layover and missing the last flight of the day from Philadelphia to Akron. So they booked me a flight for tomorrow leaving at 9 am they told me. When I finally got back home and looked into my next day flight, it's a 5.09 pm flight tomorrow night not 9 am. I called and asked about it after a 40 wait and was told that they had no more flights for tomorrow and couldn't explain all the mixed up of the day not even one! So sad that a world-class company can even think of operating this way."
405,"  Miami to San Francisco. I usually don’t write reviews but I had to on this flight. I am a former Marine, OIF & OIF Vet and I don’t do too well to confine places too long, but the flight crew Tim and Fay were outstanding and they really took care of me and my family. It was the best service I have had on a flight and I’ve had many. So thank you for your outstanding service and hospitality and it really makes a difference."
406,  I was supposed to fly out at 5 am on my way to Syracuse. 3.5 hours before the flight is scheduled to leave they cancel the flight because of mechanical issues. Are you kidding me? It's the first flight of the day and you couldn't get the maintenance done overnight? What kind of incompetent airline allows that to happen? I hadn't flown these guys in years because of poor customer service but they were the only ones who could get me to Syracuse at the necessary time. Needless to say I will never fly this airline again.
407,  El Paso to Dallas Ft Worth. This airline used to be great but lately it is worse than even the cheapest airline in the market. We flew American and experienced a delay that caused us to miss our connecting flights which in turn made us arrive 5 hours later than expected to our destination. Not only that but our flight just got delayed so much that it made us miss our connecting flight and now we are schedule to depart in 19 hours! As if it weren't enough their customer service was also terrible. You would expect that the least they could do was too book our next flight (19 hours later) with seats that would be next to each other but even that request wasn't granted! Terrible service and pathetic quality for an airline.
408,"  I have flown with AA twice in the last 18 months and both times my luggage has been misplace. The first time I was luckily on my way home from miami so the impact was minimal. However the second time was when I was on my way to a cruise from Ronald Regan Airport to Miami international. I had to go on my cruise with no luggage and to add insult to injury I spent almost 14 hours in total during my vacation just sitting on hold trying to speak to someone so that I could know the whereabouts of my luggage. I was unable to attend multiple events on the cruise due to my lack of attire which absolutely ruined my vacation which I planned year in advance. I am back home and no one has reached out to me regarding my lost luggage. I think the worst part about this airline is there lack of responsiveness. I filed a complaint with customer relations I have also filed a claim for the details of my belongings and I have yet to receive a call or an email from anyone. When I speak to a representative they are quick to pass me along to the next person. They have no empathy nor do they have the proper customer service training that would of made this experience a little more bearable. American Airlines is right up there with Spirit and Frontier. Do not fly with them if you can avoid it, and if you can’t do not check your bag. Make sure you bring it as a carry on."
409,Not Verified |  Paris to Los Angeles. Horrible experience. Took forever to get our luggage. Food was terrible. As an American first time flying with American Airlines and maybe the last. They also took so long to depart for no reason whatsoever.
410,"  Cusco to Grand Cayman via Lima / Miami. Awful. They lost my baggage. It's been 2 days and they have no idea where it is. Had the nerve to lecture me about packing a carry on for important items when I called to check on my claim?? Rude, incompetent and pathetic customer service."
411,"Not Verified |  San Antonio to Phoenix. The worst airline. It used to be something worth using, used to. I've flown American twice now in the last two months. My first flight, departure was only 15 minutes late, but the return flight was over a 4 hour delay due to ""maintenance."" A total nightmare when you have a child and planned naps. Not only that but they didn't try and offer any compensation for it. The second flight, most recent, the departure was over a 2 hour delay due to ""bird strike"" whatever the hell that is. And the return flight was over an hour delayed due to ""maintenance."" They left the plane off for about 30 minutes with everyone boarded! No AC and multiple babies on the plane sweating. It wasn't until several people complained that they did anything about it (turned on the air). I had hoped to give them a second chance but they suck."
412,"  Chicago to Budapest via Philadelphia. After planning a once in a lifetime trip to Europe with my wife, American Airlines turned it into a nightmare from the start. Our first flight to Budapest was canceled and their solution was to send us to Paris 9 hours later (lost day #1) and then the next day to Vienna (lost day 2) Well, then there was. Huge ripple affect. The car we had reserved in Budapest was no longer an option, since we were no longer going there...so we had to rent in Vienna, twice the price since we did not have a reservation and they were out of cars. Oh, did I mention that our luggage still went to Budapest but no one could find it for 3 days. We had to drive to Budapest to get our own luggage (days 3,4,5 lost) we had other flights to Venice and then to Rome from Budapest all missed because of their canceled flight... this crazy story has many more chapters but Sadly the bottom line is. They ""do not reimburse for all that we went through"" they offered us 3 vouchers 275$ each, as some sort of apology. And after looking at prices that barley covers a one way flight by American! They only sent us one voucher, and now no one will respond to me. Only an automated email!! The word ""American"" means Much than they could ever measure up too. They need to rethink this patriotic name, or raise their game to represent all the Americans they serve. My wife and I are both teachers so this truly was a once in a lifetime trip and now we have to live with this nasty aftertaste left by a airline who shares our country's name, but can not live up to other major airlines let alone the nation they think they represent. Side note.... if we had the option to give up our seats at any time, I guess we would have gotten 500$ vouchers. Sad, lack of priority's. The whole thing is very sad."
413,"Not Verified |  Phoenix to Vancouver. Charged 3 baggage charges of $70 which I thought would be covered when using my newly acquired credit card which I cancelled when I returned home. Then one of the bags was lost anyway. The Kiosks at the Phoenix airport were non-functional and the attendant was quite put-out when we asked for help. She had to use another kiosk to print out our baggage tags. Seats were very uncomfortable. In the future, I will fly any other airline available to avoid American!"
414,"Not Verified |  Evansville to Houston. Awful, flight cancelled. Trying to get to MD Anderson to a family member with lymphoma. Wouldn’t refund or transfer my ticket. Agent was beyond rude and showed no compassion to the situation. Several other friends and family tried to fly American Airlines to stay with the the family member. Same thing. Flight cancellations/delays. We all said we’ll drive to Louisville or St. Louis and take Southwest Airlines."
415,"  Miami to Orange County via Dallas. American Airlines, worst customer service yet. They proud themselves of being the best airlines in the world yet they do not treat their customers the best. I missed my connecting flight because of weather conditions and the only flight they have back to my hometown is the next morning and they didn’t even offer accommodations for sleeping. Instead the customer service lady who is suppose to assist started fighting with us saying the other person before us have other circumstances that lead to free accommodations and we came from the same flight. Now my family and I stuck in this airport waiting for our flight next morning. We were supposed to be home tonight"
416,"Not Verified |  Philadelphia to Orlando. I won't be booking with American again because of disrespectful customer service manager who lied to me several times, was sarcastically belittling my grievance, and offered no solution. I booked my family's vacation to this year on American because I wanted the assurance of picking a seat when my two daughters flew for the very first time. Specifically I passed up the cheaper tickets from several other airlines so that I could pick window seats for my daughters and my family could sit together with assigned seats. I booked 8 months ahead of the trip and paid for the specific fair where we could choose seats. A week before the first flight, I checked the app and to my surprise my family had been moved from 2 window seats for the girls and the 2 middle seats to 4 internal seats in the middle of the plane with no notification on both of our flights. I called to inquire and the initial agent reviewed the trip, acknowledged that no notification had been made, and that the original seats were now an additional $244 - but now came with free drinks for my 4 and 7 year old. The original agent was empathetic, admitted that there were plenty of open window seats, but offered no alternatives (aside from the up-charge) so I requested a manager. The manager offered no empathy (let alone an apology) and sarcastically suggested that the airline moved us because they ""had it in for E & F seat passengers"" - not humorous given the situation, and then he then repeated lied about the process, available seats, and lack of communication about the change. He even went to his go-to excuse that the original flight was on a 737MAX that was grounded but, the original email clearly shows that the original flights were on an Airbus A321 and he couldn't even admit that he had made that up. Last month when American stranded me cross-country on a business trip and their solution was a flight home two days later, I spoke to empathetic agents that did their best. I had no complaints despite the fact that it cost me time and money where the solution involved me flying back to an airport several hours away from my destination to rent a car to finish the journey. A bad experience but no hard feelings for American. My current experience however shows that the employees do not value their passengers so I'd have to warn others to book with an airline that values your business."
417,"  Philadelphia to San Juan. Words fail to convey the impressive level of incompetence that American Airlines bestows upon its “customers” each day. As United global services members, we travel frequently and are accustomed to a certain level of service ... however we have received better treatment from airlines such as Southwest. Their very creative employees revel in anticipation of finding new ways to mistreat passengers. Most other poor airlines are only capable of one or two blatant failures during any given flight. American Airlines, however, can deliver dissatisfaction from booking, through check in, boarding, meal service and disembarking the aircraft. They are a strong team dedicated to screwing up every part of your experience. My experience was so thorough, I didn’t believe I was experiencing reality any longer. It was so perfectly bad that it couldn’t be real. A Matrix-like experience only without Trinity wearing tight pants and flying helicopters.  I can truthfully say that myself, my family, and my entire company will be blacklisting this airline and I will encourage friends, acquaintances, and strangers alike to do the same."
418,Not Verified |  Harrisburg to Fargo. American Airlines changed my wife and my seat assignments without notifying us. I found this out after checking in and getting our e-boarding passes. I called customer service only to be told that after you are checked in there is nothing they can do. We will have to deal with it at the airport. Will never fly American again. Their customer service is horrible at best. The 844 number that comes up when you google American Airlines isn't even their number. They obviously are all about the money and not customer satisfaction.
419,  Boise to St. Lucia via Chicago and Miami. Never fly American Airlines! The absolute worst airline I have ever dealt with! I’m now stuck in Miami without my bag because they forced everyone to check carry on bags at the last minute and multiple people guaranteed me I would have it in Miami when I made it very clear I was here until tomorrow - absolutely nobody with American will help.
420,"  Quito to Manchester via Miami / Philadelphia. Horrendous delays with little help and explanations. Previously reviewed my outgoing journey (all but 2 flights delayed), return journey was even worse. Only the first flight, UIO to MIA was roughly on time. Second flight (MIA to PHL) was 2 hours late (stuck sat on the runway and it took an hour and a half and repeated asking for staff to offer around water). Was worried I might miss my connection but predictably the third flight was also two and a half hours delayed. No in-flight entertainment unless you have the app downloaded on your device then you can watch on that (which they tell you once on board that you needed to download before boarding)."
421,"Not Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Orlando. On our last flight, we sat on an exit row, which gave us a bit more room. The fit was a bit tighter than I'd have liked, but that's the drawback of booking economy. What I want to actually review is the fact that they were super accommodating just this week as I tried to change my flight. I planned on heading out the week after but an unexpected death in the family changed my plans. The airline was willing to work with me to move up my travel date without any cancellation or other fees, as I'd originally booked under basic economy. There was a small upgrade fee, but nowhere near as much as we'd feared it would be. I'm just happy I get to go to the funeral and that they were able to work around various schedules to get me there."
422,"  Flying both in and out of country has been a nightmare that can only be attributed to American Airlines. I had 3 connecting flights with them, and only 1 has gone as it should. My first flight was delayed due to emergency on the runway, that’s fine, what isn’t fine is being pushes aside for a rebooking the day after and getting the worst customer service I have ever received in my life. Then, the flight the next day (they rebooked) they were delayed about 2 hours because their plane wasn’t loaded with oxygen tanks for the pilots and they had to go get them. Threw off all pickup timing and car rentals. To rewind, Dallas has some of the worst reps I’ve ever spoken to and push any question you have away, from hotel stay to rebooking, to make you call their website. Pretty much useless and immediately dismissive. I will call and try and work out something but this was my experience so far and I would hate for others to go through the same ordeal. Will update if anything changes."
423,"Not Verified |  Lynchburg to Dallas via Charlotte. This was my first time flying American and there were several concern and problems. I brought a medical device and they made me check and pay for my carry-on. When I arrived at baggage claim there was a text saying it was at the baggage service desk. When I got there, one person said it was lost and another said it came early at another terminal. After waiting to see if it came with my flight since there was confusion, I had to go to the other terminal. I asked it they could bring it to me as I have a bad back and they said no. All in all, I was not happy with this airline. And they made me check my medical device at the plane. They labeled it fragile and watched the man bounce it up the stairs to the plane."
424,"Not Verified |  My flight from Baltimore to Charlotte was delayed by 2 Hours and my return flight from CLT to BWI cancelled (Monday morning). I was supposed to go to work on Monday morning but missed because of flight cancellations and reschedule. I opened up a ticket with customer service to get a refund as I had to incur loss of pay. After few days I got a call from AA customer service, lady on the phone started conversation with a lie that my flight was delayed only for half hour when it delayed for more than 2 hours and didn't even mention about cancellation, on top of that she says she is doing me favor by adding 750 miles to my account. I am the one who suffered with the delay and AA customer representative says she is doing me favor. In total my whole journey is better stated as a bad experience, no value to customers, flight delays and frustration."
425,  Boston to Los Ángeles. This has been the worst airline experience of my life. American Airlines made me miss my National Soccer tournament and the customer service was absolutely horrible. The airline did not help or give any reassurance that I would be able to make my games on time and I did not make them thanks to their lack of support and failure to help me find a new flight. Never flying on American Airlines again and recommend other people read this and follow my steps. Thanks for nothing American Airlines you really know how to ruin someone’s day!
426,"  Columbus to LaGuardia. Completely and utterly disappointed at the complete lack Of customer service interaction with American Airlines. Over the 4th of July my wife and I flew from Columbus, Ohio to LaGuardia like we do every year, non stop. The night before our fight is to leave our flight gets canceled. After spending over 3 hours straight on hold and still not a live person, we hung up after finding out we weren’t able to get on another flight to go home until the day after we were suppose to leave. Even though we booked non stop flights not only did they book us on connecting flights, but they had us flying out of Newark. Needless to say we ended up canceling our flight and renting a car to just drive home. Unfortunately it doesn’t end there. Now my wife is back in New York with our youngest son and stuck at the airport! She was suppose to fly out last night but the flight got canceled. So now after sitting on the runway, literally, cause they were told they’re waiting on pilots, before literally taking off they announce they’re having engine troubles. So now they’re heading back to the gate and she is going to have to try and arrange something for tomorrow now because like 2 weeks ago American booked her on a connecting flight instead of non stop and now she has missed her connecting flight. Who knows when she will be able to catch a single hour flight to come home, because American has treated this flight like she’s flying halfway around the world. Bottom line, there’s not a single person in this world that could GIVE my wife and I a free American Airlines ticket to anywhere in the world! Your customer service is by far the worst we’ve ever experienced!"
427,"Not Verified |  Tampa to Syracuse via Philadelphia. As I write this I am spending the night in Philadelphia's airport which is supposedly an American Airlines Hub. I flew from Tampa to Philly for a connection to Syracuse Thursday July 18th. My 9:52pm connection to Syracuse was cancelled at 3pm as I was walking into Tampa's airport due to ""weather"". I knew then I was going to have to drive to arrive in Syracuse for a Friday morning Funeral. What I didn't expect was a rude desk attendant at the gate and at customer service in a Philadelphia airport surrounded by a beautiful sunset - no apparent weather issues in sight. I spent over $250 on a one way car rental (and an hour trying to find a one way car rental) and drove the 5 hours to arrive in Syracuse at 2:30am. American Airlines booked me on the first flight to Syracuse Saturday the 20th at 3:20pm. Fast Forward to today, July 22nd and I am scheduled to leave Syracuse at 6:57pm, delay till 7:20 ... 7:31 take off. Preparing to run to my connecting gate but - no need - when we hit the ground I get notified my flight is delayed until 11:06pm. And then cancelled. I immediately call and am offered the first flight to Tampa 10:30 something am - nope wait can't have that one, its booked. The next I have available is 4:06pm! I asked if there was an any other flight to any Florida airport in the morning - no. Great, I am booked and get to spend the next 18 hours in an airport. I get on American's Website and find a 6am flight to Orlando and purchase - then call to have the associate fix this mess and she scolds me for booking the flight - saying I should have just called them for help. Wait - while I am going thru this mess my Mother is stuck overnight in O'Hare with a similar American Airlines epic-mess and has to go through the same thing. American will not reimburse the car I rented, they will not pay for me to have a hotel room tonight - there are ""snacks and cots"" available in the airport. Gone are the days of vouchers, this is all ""God's will"" and ""weather related"". Going forward I will pay twice as much for a plane ticket from another airline, I will never fly American Airlines again, if it is the only flight available I would rather rely on my good old fashioned feet to get me there faster then an American Airlines Plane."
428,"Not Verified |  Bangor to Washington. Terrible customer service. Flight got cancelled, stayed another night in Maine, come to the airport at 4am for the flight to get delayed so badly that we missed our connecting. Had to get home for family emergency. Last year we flew American to Utah and had a connection in Dallas where our flight got cancelled. It was Christmas Eve. Our group divided and didn’t get home until Christmas Day. They cancel flights often and good customer service does not follow."
429,"  This has been my first ever experience with American Airlines and it was not a good one. My first leg of travel from Erie, PA (ERI) to Tampa, FL (TPA) via Charlotte, NC (CLT) was uneventful and smooth. I arrived on time with my baggage and was quite happy with the service of the agents, flight attendants and crew. My journey home was another matter. First let me begin by saying that I understand that the airline industry cannot control the weather. Mother Nature decided to throw a fit and cover TPA in thunderstorms and lightning for several hours causing the airport to close which resulted in my missing the connection in CLT to ERI. No worries. I contacted the gate agent who quickly re-booked me onto the first flight out from CLT to ERI the next morning at 11:30am. As I had arranged hotel accommodations in Charlotte, I inquired as to how I could retrieve my bags upon arrival in CLT. She told me to simply contact the gate agent upon arrival and my bags would be retrieved for me to take to the hotel. This is NOT what happened! Upon arriving at CLT, I did contact the gate agent about my bags and was instructed to go to the baggage claim area and speak to the agent in the baggage office. I did so. There were a few people in line ahead of me inquiring about the location of their missing bags and I could quickly see how one agent was doing everything in her power to locate them, while my agent seemed to feel that the passengers (including myself) were simply a nuisance to her existence. Without effort in actually locating my bags, she informed me that she had no idea where my bags might be and did little to attempt to locate them. A baggage handler in the office was looking over her shoulder at the computer screen, asked me if my flight had landed yet! then shrugged his shoulders like, “Oh well” When I told her that I had hotel accommodations and simply needed my bags retrieved from the plane I just de-boarded so that I had clean clothing and toiletries, she handed me a complimentary American Airlines toiletry bag (which is its own review). The following morning, I arrived at the airport at 9am, passed through TSA screening and arrived at my gate with time to spare. Our plane was boarded and all passengers and crew quickly assessed that the air conditioning wasn’t quite up to par. We were de-planed and told that the air conditioning would be fixed, or another plane would be provided. Our flight was now delayed. Approximately 2 hours later, we were again seated on the plane only to be told that, again, the air conditioning was not functioning correctly and the crew was “timed out”. Our flight was now cancelled. There was one more flight to ERI from CLT that day, but it was full. I was able to arrange for a seat on the next flight to Cleveland. This meant that I had to impose upon a relative to drive 2 hours to Cleveland and another 2 hours home. Upon arrival at the terminal for the flight to Cleveland, I quickly noticed the difference in accommodations for passenger travelling to Cleveland versus those for passengers travelling to Erie. The seats in the waiting area were more comfortable and were equipped with charging stations for personal electronics, while Erie passengers were seated in worn, cramped, and uncomfortable seats with smaller charging stations (with access for 6 devices) in the waiting area. "
430,"Not Verified |  New York to Pittsburgh. Being a nervous flyer already, our Pilot was exceptional at LGA airport flight 4600 on July 21st. He cracked jokes as he prepared us to be sitting on the runway for quite some time, he updated us as status changed and throughout the flight. He was so down to earth and keeping us in the know helped calm my nerves very much !! He was the best pilot I've ever had. The seats were great and comfortable, I was overall very pleased."
431,"  Norfolk to Phoenix via Charlotte. Check in at Norfolk was easy. Staff were helpful. We do not usually expect much. Flights loaded easily and departed on time. Service on board was efficient. We did order a sandwich and it was not very good. Seems like that shouldn't be that hard to do as the prepackaged foods in the airport can be quite good. Overall, everything was very smooth. The worst part was that we actually arrived in Phoenix early (!) but could not get to the gate because it was blocked by equipment."
432,"  Weather delays, cancellations with no assistance with rebooking, cost more to book new flights, wasted food and beverage coupons, no concern with my safety or well-being by stranding me in the airport over night by myself, then more delays, missed flights, and total inconvenience of 14 hours and hundreds of dollars. Just in case you were wondering what American Airlines response to their terrible customer service on July 18 -19th. Please free the read and share. Be cautious when using them in the future ladies and gentlemen, they don't care about you. You are just another number."
433,"  Los Angeles to Kona. American Airlines has horrible service! My family and I flew to Kona Hawaii (flights 59, and 58). On the way there we were told that the flight had limited food items, and it would not be a sufficient amount to serve everyone. This was proven, as every item on the menu was not available. Also the flight attendants seemed bothered when asked for service/assistance. Once we arrived to Kona, we discovered that all of our new luggage was damaged (deep scrapes and scratches, and a thick black tar substance that would not wipe off). I was told that I would need to file a claim, which I did (including photos). I spoke to a supervisor in the baggage department of customer service. He asked that I reply to his email with photos for a second time. He stated that he would review the information and contact me with a resolution, of which he never did. I called to follow up with him, and was told that he was on another call and he'd call me right back. As of the writing of this review, he still has not followed up with me. On the flight home, it was the same issue, not enough food for everyone. They did not have any of the requested items on their menu. Furthermore, the plane was nasty and it appeared that they did not clean trash left from several previous customers. I would not recommend AA."
434,"  New York to Atlanta via Washington. I was flying from NYC with 2 children, one of whom has severe eczema and mild allergies, and whose meds wasn't allowed in the carry on and thrown in to the trash by TSA. Our nightmare had began. So, I was on a deadline to get home in Atlanta. Then, the gate attendant informed us that there is no more space in the overhead bin that we have to check in our carry on. We touched down in DC under sunny skies with 40 minutes to make our connection flight and immediately the pilot announced that all outbound flights are grounded due to incoming inclement weather but no to worry about connections since everything is grounded. Meanwhile I have not any updates from AA trough text, Although we signed up for it. The nightmare got worse when a dozen passengers or so going to Atlanta were prevented from boarding the shuttle (a 2 minute bus ride) to the next concourse, where our flight was still waiting, due to adverse weather conditions. We were directed to customer service desk. What occurred there is a classic example of how AA employees treat customers with disdain and condescension. I was informed that I would be put on a flight for the next morning although my flight still on the ground. When I asked her if she could find alternate route for me to get home the same night, she sighed, rolled her eyes, and told me step aside since I didn't want to be helped. I was also informed that the airlines will not help with hotel or meals and that I and the kids were on our own. This is the 3rd time AA has done this me and one of those times I was in a foreign country. I've come to believe that these aren't isolated incidents but inherent to the way AA does business. As much as it is under my power, I will not fly with American Airlines."
435,"  Richmond to Salt Lake City via Chicago. I was to leave RIC at 0740 EST and arrive in ORD at 0853 CDT. Then from ORD at 1030 CDT with an arrival at 1223 MDT in SLC. Because of weather my flight to ORD was delayed. They automatically rebooked me because the delay was until 1228 EST. Which would have caused me to miss my original connection flight in ORD to SLC. They booked me to go to DFW. But, I wasn’t given a seat. I was told to talk to someone in ORD to get my seat. Then from DFW I was connecting there to finish up in SLC at 0032 MDT. Which was 12 hours later than the original final destination arrival time. Well I got to ORD to find out they canceled my flight to DFW. They rebooked me from ORD to SLC at 2045 CDT. With an arrival of 2230 MDT. I was delayed again. I finally left ORD at 2130 CDT and arrived in SLC at 0002 MDT. Just to find out my luggage was missing. Didn’t know where. They said they would call me when it is found. I understand weather is uncontrollable. However, American Airlines didn’t try to make me comfortable. I sat in the airport for over 12 hours not even knowing if I was going to get home. The gates kept changing. The flights kept changing. And, I was so lost. I was scared and upset. There was no communication except through email. Customer service was definitely not around. And, on flights pretzels and soft drinks are not acceptable as the only option. Especially when you know people have been shuffling around with no direction. Also, my seats were bad, the air didn’t flow, and it was extremely tight quarters. Old plane. Not fun!! Let’s just say, I did not enjoy my trip with American Airlines."
436," New York to Cincinnati. All the time this airline has delays, today is 2 hours, I swear that this is the last time I use this garbage of airline. And the customer service is the worst - nobody knows anything."
437,"  Salt Lake City to Oklahoma City via Dallas. In Dallas / Fort Worth airport: I had to check in my carry on because I was told there was no room in the overhead storage bins (they were all full). As the flight was preparing for take off, I noticed that four storage bins were completely empty. I was not happy. On my return trip, I had another layover at the Dallas/ Fort Worth airport. There was a problem with my ticket as I was trying to make my connecting flight. I told the person at the information booth upon leaving the airplane about my problem. She was impatient with me and told me to go to the boarding gate. I went to the gate as instructed with 36 minutes before boarding. There was no one at the booth. When I went to board with my problem ticket, the person checking tickets was irritated with me telling me I should have talked to someone before boarding. I was tired from the previous flight. I did not need to be treated this way."
438,  Greenville to San Diego via Dallas. Worst experiences with this airline and i’m done with them if I can ever get off this tarmac. On my flight out here i had a one hour layover that turned into a 4hr layover. I didn’t end up to my hotel until close to 1am and had to get up for work 4hrs later. Now on my way back to San Diego I had a one hour layover again and i’ve been stuck on the plane on the tarmac for 2hrs with no end in sight. They told us at first we didn’t have pilots and then that we had a bad tire. They also oversold every plane I was getting on both ways and EVERY trip was delayed at least 30 mins just trying to get people to sell their seats. They offer a voucher for about $450 and just wait. If people don’t take it after 10-15mins they up they voucher offer. I seen this go on for 45mins. Did I talk about how I got my luggage back minus the handle i gave it to them with?
439,"  
Salt Lake City to Orlando. I fly once a month or more for work. Occasional plans change and I change or cancel my reservation. I’ve never had a problem canceling and receiving a refund if I cancel it within 24 hours of when it was booked. I needed to cancel an American flight within 5 hours of booking they cancelled if just fine but then refused to process my refund. I was stunned I spent 2 hours trying to get ahold of someone but they refused to help me and best they were willing to do was rebook it. I’ve canceled well over 10 flights within the 24 hour window and this is the first time I’ve been given grief. Very frustrating. I would like to say I’ll never fly American again however sometimes it’s my only option. But I will say this they will be the last option for the indefinite future I’d even choose frontier and spirit over them. "
440,"  On July 15th, flight #1835 C17 from Dallas to Las Vegas has been cancelled after delaying for 2 hours. We got passes for waiting list for gate C29 where all the unprofessional behavior started. The supervisor started yelling to us why we went there and we have to remain quiet without asking questions! Of course we have not been in the second flight and when we asked what is the next step, the supervisor of AA said that she will call the police! She said that she’s working for 12 years at the AA and no one will touch her for her behavior! Finally we left unhelpful from C29 and went back to C17 where an agent gave us new boarding pass for another flight after 3 hours. Total delay 6 hours. But the point is the unprofessional and unacceptable behavior of the supervisor who believes that she owns the company. I have never dealt with a worse customer service and worse employee in my life. What a disgrace for the company keeping people like her dealing with customers. Never again with AA we are family of 4. "
441,"  Pittsburgh to Montego Bay via Charlotte. Cancelled , delayed flights rebooked not till days later return flight worse delays circling airport flew to Raleigh for fuel back to Charlotte to circle more landed sat for 20 minutes till gate disembark no food available, no customer service. We flew out of Jamaica at 12:30 pm arrived at Charlotte 8:00pm ( that’s 7 1/2 hours it’s a 3 1/2 hour flight) left Charlotte 10:00 pm arrived in Pittsburgh at 12:00 am . no customer service no food given to us the entire trip This trip took longer than it should have we traveled with a child. No excuses would not recommend American Airlines"
442,"  Across 6 flights I had an issue every time! 1st flight: seat didn’t recline and tray table didn’t stay up 2nd flight: was charged for baggage twice and never refunded, was told the matter was closed and I would not be compensated 3rd flight: i booked these flights for someone else and they had to be changed. 36 hours, 4 phone calls and a visit to the help desk at the airport (was told to do that) saw me having to forfeit the total cost of the flights. Not one person wanted to help, they kept pointing me in another direction until it was impossible to change anything due to the time. 4th flight: what was meant to be a 90 minute flight was a delayed flight that had me sitting in the aircraft for 8hours! No food was available due to it being a ‘short haul’ flight. 5th flight: my partner had a direct flight from NY to Miami at 7:30 am, with no notice they changed it to a connecting flight to Atlanta at 2:30pm, this flight kept getting delayed and no one wanted to help him get to his destination without being stuck in Atlanta. He eventually got on a 7:30pm flight! 6th flight: the power point in my seat didn’t work. The response from ‘customer service’ is appalling! I was overcharged and treated badly."
443," Washington to Charlotte. The customer service was disappointing. The customer rep from DCA to CLT was more interested in others conversation than to me, who was in front of her, talking to her. In addition, the look she gave me, was like I was bothering her, although I was paying for an upgraded seat."
444,"  Boston to Cancun via Philadelphia. American Airlines sent me a text at 5:45 pm on Saturday July 6th telling me my flight at 5:15 Boston to Philly was cancelled but the flight Philly to Cancun was not. They put me on hold for hours, missed my friend's wedding reception. We left from Boston and flew 6:30 and we would leave Miami at 3:15. That also got cancelled. We had an 11 hr lay over and not slept so we got a hotel to sleep for a while. We spoke with a pilot who was called in to fly another flight to Cancun and he looked into it and told us it was a crew issue. He said they did not have a crew to fly the plane. We got to the resort at 10:00pm and lost a whole day. American Airlines Customer service are telling me it was weather related and will not compensate us. I will never fly American again."
445,"  Manchester to Quito via Philadelphia / Miami. A 3-leg journey supposed to take 18 hours. First flight (MAN-PHL) ended up delayed by 2 hours as we had to return to gate to rearrange the luggage due to an issue with ""centre of gravity"". This meant I missed my connection in Philadelphia (and consequently all of my subsequent connections!). Airline staff were pleasant and organised me a hotel for the evening and replacement flights for the following day. PHL to MIA was very successful with the flight fulfilling my very basic requirement of travelling from one place to another relatively on time. Miami to Quito however was not so successful. It was announced 10 minutes prior to departure that there was going to be at least a 2 hour delay due to waiting for a replacement pilot! This time got gradually later and later. Finally arrived in Quito however at this point had missed my ongoing flight. As this had been booked separately from AA they offered no help for me to rearrange. Only positive about this airline is the really helpful flight attendants who I would commend. Nearly every review talks about delayed and cancelled flights - really take this into account, especially if you have transfers! Definitely worth paying a bit more to go with a more reliable airline in future."
446,"Not Verified |  Atlanta to Dallas via Corpus Christi. The staff refused to help my partner and I with Hotel accommodations that ATL promised us to due to our delayed flight caused by mechanical errors. Told us we could camp out in the terminal until the next day and mentioned we could go online to find hotels without means of transportation. Finally spoke to someone from AA Customer Service who did, in fact, confirm that mechanical errors automatically provide paying customers with hotel accommodations. By the time we reached the phone agent, the staff literally left the premises and did not return to us and left two of her desk agents to help us out. What a sorry excuse of a Supervisor."
447,"Not Verified |  We booked flights in January 2019 to Fairbanks for June 23 and a return flight from Vancouver for July 7. In late January or early February 2019 the return flights were cancelled, likely due to the grounding of the 737 MAX planes. We got those flights re-booked and about three days later the departing flights were cancelled and also had to be re-booked. This made us very nervous. The new flight times, the connections and layovers were much worse than the originals but the seats were good. Very few options were offered so we took what we could get. A delay was encountered on June 23 in Chicago. No food was on board and our Seattle flight was delayed for an hour. Thanks to a Seattle layover this did not cause us to miss a flight. When we showed up at the gate in Vancouver on July 7 we were directed to a gate agent who offered another change to Greenville with connections through DFW that they said would be great and save us a connection, a long layover and nine hours. We jumped at the chance to get home early with the understanding that the flight was not overbooked. We were then directed to get seat assignment at the gate. The Vancouver to DFW seating was terrible (last row, 30 A/B). The Greenville seats had me in 30F and my wife in 21 F. Those were great seats. Not. We were deceived at the gate by a the agent and his supervisor. The Vancouver to Dallas AA 979 leg on the return of this flight boarded and was ready to take off when the flight crew again announced that they did not have enough food (best guess soft drinks) on-board. The flight was delayed for over one hour while the crew waited for the caterer. This delay almost made me miss my connection to Greenville SC. The flight attendants handed out soft drinks like candy. The rest room lines were long and disruptive. We have never been so glad to get off of a flight in our lives. After being asked the flight attendants reluctantly asked passengers whose destination was DFW to stay seated so those with tight connections could disembark. Some complied, others did not. WHAT is going on at American? They seem to have cheap flights but not much else. They claim to be the largest carrier in the world. They need to concentrate on customer service and satisfaction."
448,"  San Antonio to Dallas via Indianapolis. I don't like American Airlines. I have always found them to be rude and unhelpful. Checked in online before I got to the airport. Went to the rude ticked counter agent who told me I had to check in again. She refused to print a boarding pass. So I asked her what she was there to do. Apparently it was to put my bag on a conveyor belt. So whatever on that. Can't fix rude customer service people. I feel it in my heart that she had something to do with my bag getting lost. She had a spiteful attitude about her - if I pay 30.00 for my luggage I expect it to arrive with me intact. I left from San Antonio to Dallas. The gate where we landed was C11 and I was flying out of C10 to Indianapolis. 30+ minutes in between flights. I get to Indianapolis, no bag. I did receive a text from American saying that the bag was lost. I was not able to talk to a lost bag clerk because I had a shuttle waiting for me. I then go to the link in the text and start to fill out a claim-  link is not working. I call 30 minute wait time. I guess this is how American airlines likes to operate. I only flew them because the company I work for bought the tickets."
449," We booked our honeymoon flight to Orlando with American Airlines and we were truly disappointed. The flight itself was not bad. However, seats are not assigned but rather purchased at ridiculous prices at check in. We forgot to check in 24 hours before our flight home and almost every seat was taken by the time we realized we hadn't checked in. Our only option to sit next to each other was in the emergency exit row and pay $81 each! If we didn't want to sit next to each other, we would have to pay $78. Why are we paying for a seat? Isn't that what the ticket was for? Checking in early allows you to pick a seat at $15-$20 but why were we ""punished""? We will not be flying AA anytime soon."
450,"Not Verified |  Do not fly American Airlines! Our trip to and from Myrtle Beach was a disaster! They cancelled our flight home, we ended up having to spend the night in a hotel ($160 which we had to pay for) and flying to an airport two hours away from home. We then had to rent a car (another $165) and drive home. The AA representatives are extremely unhelpful and rude. I have flown other airlines and have never had an issue."
451,  Kansas City to Charlotte. The flight was on time and soon as we are supposed to be boarding they pushed the boarding back 15 minutes talking about its a storm so they will let up know something at 5pm then text messages come to my phone saying departure is at 515 and then another came through shortly after with a departure time of 530. Once again shortly after that another message comes through saying that departure at 8pm then someone comes over the speaker stating that know there is maintenance issues and the flight is cancelled and we need to make are way to the outside counter to reschedule the flight because they was closing their counter. Rescheduled my flight for 12hrs later and they did not provide hotel or anything for the inconvenience if it was a maintenance issues as they stated. Definitely will not fly with them if i can help it.
452,"  Philadelphia to Chicago. Never again will this airline get my business. Delayed 3x and then cancelled with NO help for accommodations from the very airline who caused the problem. NO weather problems. The return flight was delayed, bumped, and finally my seats were given to standby with the call center saying we were checked in and ready, and the counter agent saying another. Absolutely zero help in any way. Their solution? Sleep in the airport. With my kids?! I found another airline with the route we needed standing right there at the American check in counter. Will I see a penny of these cancelled and delayed flights? I doubt it, so as far as I'm concerned, this airline is run by thieves."
453,"  Houston to Los Angeles. In Houston airport for 25 hours, they keep changing the depart time and no explanation. Not even once they explained whats going on, not even one of them asked if we need anything, its 10 of us and they keep delaying our flight."
454,"  London to Columbus via New York. I landed into JFK on time. While waiting for my connecting flight to CMH, it was delayed twice, then cancelled. I was rebooked the following day and had to pay for my own hotel since it was claimed to be 'weather' despite the fact that other airlines did not cancel the same route. I woke at 3 AM for my rebooked 5:45 AM flight to find that it was cancelled as well and rebooked for 2 days after the original flight. I was forced to rent a car and drive 9 hours to Columbus, OH in order to make a very important appointment on Tuesday, July 9th when my flight was originally scheduled for Saturday, July 6th. I am ashamed that in the future, I will have to fly a foreign airline in order to ensure that I get where I need to go. I will not risk flying with American again. This event overshadowed the fact that the seat was uncomfortable, the cabin staff rude and the food disappointing. This was a truly horrible experience."
455,"  I will never buy a ticket again with AA! I don't care if I pay more but I will book with an airline that really cares for people. My husband (in the navy) made it to the USA for his birthday, but thank you to American Airlines we could not be together, my flight was cancelled. It is not just today! In the last 2 months, my flight was cancelled twice. Last time it was cancelled in Boston. I missed two days at work (but AA seems does not care )."
456,"  Left Jackson, MS at 4.30pm and was scheduled to land at DFW with connecting flight to Burbank, CA. We got about 175 miles out of Dallas and were told there was a big thunder storm and we would have to circle. All departing flights were cancelled. After about 30 minutes, we were diverted to San Antonio for refueling. We sat on the tarmac for almost 2 hrs, were not allowed to deplane. The crew provided little or no information about other connections, but they were very clear that American Airlines would not cover overnight stay. We finally reached Dallas at 9.30pm. There was no one to help us reschedule our flights or help with hotel rooms and the ticketing counters were all closed. Passengers who checked their bags in the jetway (for no cost) were able to retrieve them. Those of us dummies who played by the rules and paid $30 to check a bag were told our luggage had to go all the way to the destination. I argued with an AA ""Customer Service"" agent in baggage that I needed the cpap machine in my bag, but she just quoted airline policy. I made my own hotel reservation, paid $50 for a taxi, repeated that the next morning, and flew back to Jackson, a flight I arranged on my own from my hotel room. No one from American Airlines tried to be helpful or provide any information, even to the poor young woman whose 1yr old baby was crying from hunger. Never again."
457,"❎ Not Verified | Myrtle Beach to Charlotte, via San Francisco, was delayed due to weather for about an hour and a half. So some genius decided to keep the connecting flight from Charlotte to San Fransisco in regular schedule despite connecting flight from Myrtle Beach to Charlotte was delayed. Instead of delaying the flight from Charlotte to San Fransisco to allow passengers to get to San Fransisco the same night, we were scheduled to catch the flight going out the next day. Now that's flight management."
458,"  Flight from Charlottesville to New York. Starts with 2hrs delay, at the airport they notified other 2 hrs, 10 minutes before boarding time they canceled the flight! I lost my connection to Europe putting me in a lot of troubles and they didn't care at all. Staff rude and incompetent. They usually cancel flights without any notification. I will never fly with them again!"
459,"Not Verified |  On the morning of June 21st, I booked 2 tickets on my computer. I choose the date of June 23rd as our travel date. I clearly saw June 23rd on my screen. I checked my email inbox for ticket confirmation directly following and for the next 10 or 15 minutes. I did not have time to keep checking as I had to leave for a funeral. The tickets were $385.20 total, $192.60 each. We arrived at the airport at 5am for our 6:08am flight on June 23rd only to be told we had no flight scheduled that day and that the flight was scheduled for July 14th! We were in total shock! We explained to the counter woman that there must have been a computer clitch and that we would not just show up for a flight three weeks early. To our additional shock, she did not care whatsoever, told us it was our fault, that our ticket was non refundable, and that it would now be an additional $501.60 each to fly. With the long line and having to be on that flight for a business meeting, we gave her our credit cards. As a flier of AA for 35-40 years we were shocked and upset to be treated this way. We explained to multiple people at the airport and on the phone trying to get help and no one would help us. It's been weeks since we emailed customer relations with no acceptable response. We are now at a point where we believe AA has created a system to intentionally lock out customers from getting timely help and a way to steal money from its customers. AA does not care about us as people or future customers. It's hard to believe AA would be ok with its good customers paying $694.20 each for a ticket that should have been $192.60 each for a computer clitch. If at all possible, do not fly American Airlines!"
460,"  Phoenix to Philadelphia. My son and I were scheduled to fly to Philadelphia in May, 2019. The night before, my son came down with severe stomach flu, throwing up a dozen times in just a few hours. Our flight was booked to leave at 6 am the next morning and there was no way my son would be able to make it. I called AA and was told that unless his illness was critical, I would have to make the flight or lose my $800 air fare. I stated that I was uncomfortable subjecting my son and the passengers to this flight. I was then told that I could take my son to the gate and have him evaluated. I couldn't believe it. Their solution was to have me get my sick son up at 4am, go to the airport, go through checkin and TSA, and finally get to the gate and have airline employees evaluate whether my son was too sick to fly. I was shocked. I chose not to subject my son to the flight, and the passengers to the stomach flu and I lost over $800 in airfare. I'm an Advantage member and I sent an email to AA about this situation. I received an automated email stating that I would get a response back from AA within 10 days. At the time of this review, it has been over 3 weeks, and no response. "
461," Chicago to Sacramento. We had 3 delays and once the plane arrived and de-boarded we were told a half hour later there were no pilots. We then had to wait an additional hour and by the time we actually took off we were stuck on the runway for another hour. We had a ride in Sacramento that had to wait until 11 pm to pick us up. No voucher or anything for constant delays. We fly out of Dubuque to Chicago and its constant delays or cancellations, passengers are often bumped for more important John Deere executives. This flight we had to either choose a 1hr layover (which would never happen) or a 5hr layover which turned into an 8 hr layover. Profits over people seem to be the norm. A little pre-planning and routing logistics could solve that problem, it's just you don't care and there is no governing body that cares. Were hoping the possible Amtrack that is in the future will eliminate the use of flights, at least there on time. That or drive to Madison and take Frontier, they are always on time."
462,  Springfield to Dallas via Phoenix. This airline is consistently behind and what's worse is how little they seem to care about how they drastically affect people's travel plans. There announcements lack clarity or empathy. We waited for 2 hours 10 min. and 1 hour was simply because they did not plan adequately for a pilot. Similar scenarios have happened to my wife and I often. We have flown Delta with far fewer issues. It really seems like AA is a minor league team trying to play in the big leagues. They could learn a few things about customer relations and service from Delta and Southwest.
463,"  
Dallas to Vancouver. They cancelled my flight 6 hours before departure, rebooked for 4 days later nothing they could do about early flight. We end up going home one day after with another company paid for a last minute one-way ticket way more expensive than our original tickets. So after a month fight with American Airlines they finally approved a partial refund for the service they never realized. The only problem they did a partial refund to a Mastercard. I do not have, never had a MasterCard. Even so, I already told them 9 times I do not have a MasterCard they keep telling me there is nothing they can do because by regulation they must refund the money to the same method of payment. I paid with the only credit card I have, a Visa, but no one in America Airlines can understand they have a problem on their file."
464,  Changed Flights multiple times then at last minute they send text that we will not have time to make the connecting flight to Tennessee. Rescheduled flight to Tennessee and instead of originally flying right out of Charlotte we had a 4.50 hr layover. Had to change our rental car pickup multiple times and it ended up costing extra due to all the changes. Now flying home they give us 30 min to try and get from terminal 5 to the Commuter terminal at LAX and if you have tried that it’s very unlikely. Will not change flight to something with a reasonable connecting flight unless we pay 50000 air miles each. Worst customer service I have ever had with an airline! Will get rid of the air miles AA Advantage Card and card and stick with our other airline! Called multiple times to try and resolve this issue and like I said before they wanted 50000 more air miles to change flight or a lot of money! I would love to see them consistently make the transfer from terminal 5 to the Commuter terminal and to deal with all the flight change BS and extra costs to the consumer! Unacceptable
465,❎ Not Verified | Dallas to Fayetteville via Charlotte. A warning to soldiers and their families transferring to Ft Bragg. Do not rely on American Eagle between Charlotte and Fayetteville. They are consistently inadequate and they lack accountability. I recommend using another airline to travel to Raleigh Durham and driving in.
466,"Not Verified |  Greenville to Phoenix via Dallas. I have flown throughout Europe, the United States, and South America, and they are by far the worst airline ever.  I have never seen such rude, incompetent staff in my life and you cannot trust anything they tell you. I opened a credit card and paid $2000 for a discount credit and bonus miles. But if I'd known I'd be spending the credit on a hotel due to my second canceled flight with American, I never would have opened it. On top of this, they did not give me my bonus miles for spending the $2000 and gave us no compensation for hotel or food when our flight was canceled. They misplaced our luggage on both legs of the trip, and due to maintenance issues on our first plane, we missed our connecting flight. They rerouted us to the smallest airport imaginable in Durango, CO for an extra 3 hours while we tried to make it to Phoenix, although we were promised a direct flight when arriving in DFW. Another AA staff member told us her boss would hang her if she messed up at her job (when trying to book us new tickets for our canceled flight - this also took 40+ minutes). If that is how they treat their own workers, it is no wonder the customers receive such horrible service as well. Every  one of our flights was delayed, and when one of our flights was canceled, they redirected us to an entirely new destination airport 3 hours away from where we live, yet managed to send our luggage to another airport! In addition, their planes are uncomfortable with no entertainment or power cords for phones. There is so much more to tell, but just thinking about the incompetency of this airline makes my brain hurt. I just want others to know how horrible they are so they will not make the same mistake. If you want to spend the majority of your vacation in an airport/on a plane, book American. "
467," Albuquerque to Charlotte via Dallas. On the flight from Albuquerque to Dallas, we got notification from the app the connecting flight from Dallas to Charlotte was canceled for operation reason and only available options were in next day. AA simply cancel people's flight as soon as they want for no reason! And they are not responsible for any accommodation, simply ask you to take care of yourself with your own cost."
468,"  Ft Myers to Charlotte. Very disappointed with the service I received. I will never fly this airline again and will tell others to avoid this airline.  After upgrading my seats online to ensure my travel companion and I were seated together, only the second half of the connecting flight was assigned but I was still charged a full amount for preferred seating options on both flights. After waiting half an hour on the phone I was told to come in early to address it at check in. After coming to the airport 4 hours early, we were told it would have to be addressed at the gate. An attendant didn't arrive until 1.5 hours before the flight. When I kindly asked for assistance, he informed me the flight was completely full and said ""Oh well, you have a window seat, use that as a bargaining chip."""
469,"  Issues on outbound as well as return flights - lesson learned. Unfortunately AA is not the caliber of airline it probably was in years past. I typically fly Delta with great success however on certain flights I’ve used US Air (now AA) but this last experience was such a cluster that I felt it warranted a review. On our outbound flight from DFW to Colorado Springs our flight was continually delayed as well as with each delay the gates seemed to move as well - at one point it got so ridiculous it became comical. Our departure out of DFW had officially past our originally arrival time in COS. Regardless we rolled with it because hey we’re on vacay and not worth letting it impact our mood. (Keep in mind this delay was not impacted by weather - not sure what the issue was here and they didn’t seem to want to explain) On our return flight out of COS to DFW the flight was cancelled around 3pm for a 4:38 departure. But it gets better from here. We just happened to be first in line to check our bag when the cancellation announcement was made...we thought ok at least were in line already. We step up to the counter and tell the young lady we realize she’s not responsible and we appreciate anything she can do to help us. First offer was best they could do was get us out on. Monday flight (it was Saturday) bc all their flights on Sunday we’re booked. After several concerning questions I got her to agree to explore putting us on another carrier - our options United or Delta. We asked for Delta based on their hub locations and our final destination. Then we were told nothing available. We thought we had seats on a United flight out the next day but still exploring same day departure options we stopped at the Delta counter to see what flights they had - they had options out that evening as well as next day. We went back to American counter spoke to supervisor (with flight info from the Delta rep) and he said he could get us on that flight - he assured us all was good and cancelled our “seat” on United. This is where it got ridiculous - we took our voucher to Delta only to find AA rep never fully finished the booking and we in fact weren’t confirmed and now the seats in United were gone as well. We went back and forth between counters - each only to find the AA reps were not completing the process to truly get their client booked on another carrier and the other carrier flights were now selling out. One AA passenger ended up going to Delta and paying a higher rate to hurry and guarantee her a seat in hopes AA would make it right. This went on and on and on with multiple passengers. Hours later now all flights out of COS Saturday and Sunday were gone and we were then told our only option was to shuttle from COS to Denver at $50 per person, rent a hotel room and get to airport Sunday morning (unconfirmed seats on Delta) and pray we make it home. Thankfully the ticket and gate agents with Delta were empathetic and worked hard to make sure they got us on. I was told at the airport they couldn’t compensate us for any of our out of picket expenses we wouldn’t have to call AA - which I did only for the guy on the other end to be completely rude and inform me I should had taken that up with the folks at the airport and if they told me to call them they then lied. Save your money, time and energy and pick another airline."
470,"Not Verified |  American Airlines is an absolutely terrible airline. We have had trouble with them on past flights and gave them another chance but nothing like this. In one single day we had both of our flights delayed, one of which was a simple flight from new Philadelphia to Pittsburgh and it was delayed 5 times for a total time of 7 hrs. Every time they delayed it they never updated their monitors. They told us two completely different gates for boarding. The attitude from some of the workers was terrible. And last but certainly not least they lost our luggage (never even put it on the plane) I was told I would be having it delivered to my house first thing in the morning and it is now 3pm and have no call from their driver. We will never fly your airline again nor will I ever recommend your airline to anyone. Thank you for a completely stressful flight home from what should have been the end of a relaxing honeymoon."
471,"  Phoenix to Denver. American Airlines is the worst airline I’ve ever flown. My boyfriend and I are on the same itinerary, and instead of seating us together have to upgrade to be able to select our seats. Customer service sucks. On the way to Denver, we arrived at least 20 minutes prior to cutoff time for bag drop off. The attendant told us to wait for her. We waited almost over 10 minutes as she was the only attendant and she literally did nothing. At that point when we were tended to, she told us that the bags couldn’t be loaded and she would have to rebook us on July 4, where there were practically no seats on standby. In comparison to other companies like Jetblue and Southwest, American is not very savvy to the customer experience. It almost seems like their planes - outdated and too tired to care. Big doesn’t necessarily mean better. Amenities are meager. No internet (jetblue and southwest offer). Stupid snacks. Please give fresher, more updated and less monopolizing airlines a chance."
472,"  American Airlines is a total joke. My flight, flight 251, from Miami to New York (JFK) was cancelled on Sunday, July 7th, 2019. Because of their incompetence, I had to spend an extra day in Miami in the hotel at my own expense and then spend $1,500 to purchase a ticket to New York on Delta Airlines on Monday, July 8th. I was put in on standby to La Guardia airport and that is where my bag currently is and I have to waste my time now and go to La Guardia airport in order to pick up my luggage. If I were to stay with what you were offering me in terms of re-booking, I would not get into New York until Tuesday, July 9th and I had to fly through Norfolk. Then one of the customer service agents at Miami offered to fly on Monday, July 8th from Miami to Key West, from Key West to Charlotte and then from Charlotte to La Guardia. I have never seen anything as ridiculous as this and AA customer service employees at Miami are terrible and no help at all. There were about 180 people placed on standby to New York, there was no chance that any of us would make it to New York on Sunday. I will never in my life fly with American Airlines again unless they compensate me back my $1,500 back which I had to spend because of their incompetence and inability to run the airline efficiently."
473," Dallas Ft Worth to Detroit. I will do my best to avoid flying them again. We were forced to sit on the plane at the gate for over an hour in the Texas heat. The plane was hot to say the least. The flight attendant started serving drinks in 1st class (alcohol). After she made her round through 1st class, I hit the call button. Flight attendant came over. I asked her for a drink (included in my upgraded seat). She responds, I can't because we would run out. I asked to purchase 1 & was also refused. (I'm 100% sober). Fast forward to us finally in the air. 1st class had snacks, towels, earphones & 2nd round of drinks. Hit the call button & here comes the flight attendant. I asked for a drink & was told I had to wait another 10-15 minutes. At this point it had been almost 2.5 hours on the plane. We ended up over a hour late to our destination. I missed my ride & had to get an uber. Which took forever! Which only made me get checked into my hotel at 3:00am. This is causing me to miss work!"
474,"❎ Not Verified | Miami to Tampa. I was cancelled by these jerks on Sunday and had to drive home from Charlotte (10 hours). I am now stuck in Miami because their plane is not working. This used to be the best airline. Now they are the worst. Two days, one cancel and a possible second cancel. Do not fly American. They are overpriced and their equipment apparently is old and needs to be replaced. One more example of corporate greed and poor management."
475,Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Philadelphia. I have never had a more upsetting experience with an airline. First we were all sent for a gate change to international terminal. Long walk. Then we received text to go back to original gate. Time changed at least 3 times. Agents were rude and no help. Finally text came flight was postponed until next day. Only no agents informed is. Again no help and poor attitudes. We were told we could get our bags if we waited but only some of us got them. I waited 3 hours. Finally told it might be on flight tomorrow which was then also cancelled. They could not find my bag so I went home empty handed. If bag does not come I am faced with a vacation with no clothes or anything. Could I be more upset or disappointed in an airline? No. It has ruined my vacation and left me horribly stressed and upset. I strongly recommend you think twice before you consider flying on this airline. I will not.
476," I bought 4 round trip tickets from Greenville to Phoenix two months early. After two overbooked flights left us standing in the airport with hotel accommodations reserved, the desensitized AA employees would not book us on other routes to our destination. The next disappointment was the flight cancelled with no explanation. I refused to be rebooked, requested a refund, then bought Delta tickets out of Atlanta and drove there to start my vacation with three wasted days. I don't understand why selling seats you don't have is not false advertising and the airline is not responsible to reimburse you for lost time and reservation accommodations. I never intend to fly AA again! I would rate them negatively but don't see that on the scoring."
477,"  Purchase tickets through Expedia 60 days in advance, showed up to American Airlines terminal kiosk, printed two tickets but did not print tickets for the baggage, therefore we were sent to the line and we missed our flight. Was told we could fly standby to Phoenix which we did. The plane left late from LAX therefore we missed our connecting flight in Phoenix, stranded for the night, told later on in the evening that there was no available flights. The following day had to purchase tickets direct from Phoenix to Cabo. We lost a day of our vacation we had to pay for a hotel and food we were all-inclusive in Mexico and now nobody wants to help us with the refund."
478,"  Miami to Washington. This is by far the worst airline that anyone can take. As someone who travels and consistently flies 3-5 times a month, I try to avoid American Airlines at all costs. They are delayed, cancelled, unprepared, unorganized, and extremely disrespectful. The last flight I took, American didn’t even schedule a pilot for their aircraft. Today, we had a 25 minute delay because the flight attendants and crew did not arrive on time. Also as a bystander, I am absolutely disappointed and appalled at the way American Airlines employees talk to their customers. I saw a customer get yelled at and was asked to return when he was “ready to listen”, and then the American Airlines employee stormed off. They are extremely rude, they could care less about their customers, and they do the very bare minimum. I would not recommend this airline to anybody, and it’s unfortunate that they are even still in business. Save your money and spend it on a more informed airline that actually cares about its passengers, it really does not get worse than this."
479," Portland to Dallas with American Airlines. So first they offered vouchers for volunteers to take a different flight which I wish I would’ve taken cause that group ended up leaving before us. We boarded the plane on time then there was a maintenance issue which I understand. However, they kept us on that plane for almost 2 hours, also not really telling us anything that’s going on besides one or two times, by this time the other plane was boarding and I would’ve had a $1000 voucher which I honestly believe I now deserve! After finally getting us a new plane they kick everyone off and I am now 3 hours late to where I’m supposed to be. I’ve never dealt with so much chaos and I’m utterly disappointed with this experience so far. I would really appreciate being compensated for the voucher I missed out on at least, since this was a terrible mistake made by your airline."
480,"Not Verified |  San Diego to Dallas. Literally cancelled my flight 1 day ago and now today American Airlines have cancelled again, get another flight booked today when I'm supposed to have been home since Saturday. Rate them no star, luckily I have a friend here who can provide me a stay."
481,"  Orange County to Dallas via San Antonio. Abusive and endless fees and an insulting even cynical frequent flyer/customer appreciation plan where they try to get you to pay extra (mileage multiplier) to actually earn any meaningful miles or credit, they are supposed to be showing appreciation for your business not insulting you. American stuck us on the tarmac in Dallas for three hours knowing full well there was no chance of departure - when asked they said ""maybe they needed the gate"" - hot, stuffy and never bothered to ask if we wanted anything to drink. Just another day at American Airlines."
482," Horrible customer service. Our flight from Amsterdam to Dallas was delayed by 3 hours due to maintenance issues (this seems to be a recurring theme on recent AA flights I’ve flown!). We missed our connection from DFW to Sacramento so they rebooked us on a later flight which got canceled due to weather. I understand it’s impossible to give everyone their most desired flight alternative but the agents were not helpful! They made us beg for a hotel voucher. They claim it’s weather-related issue but we wouldn’t have been booked on the canceled flight had it not been for a maintenance issue on our original flight! Also, other airlines rebook customers to other airlines if need be. AA just flat out said they don’t have any partner airlines. I don’t think that’s true because they have code share flights. From now on AA will be our last option when flying!"
483,"Not Verified |  Charlotte, NC to Boston, MA with American Airlines. Terrible customer service. Cancelled flight and then booked me on another flight 46 hours later after I had already completed the first leg of my trip. My husband had the same issue 1 week earlier, so this is a recurring problem for them. Inability to rebook you on a convenient flight. If you call, you are directed to gate agents, which are not at the gate. Gate agents tell you to call the airline. No one else you solve the problem of the flight they cancelled."
484,"❎ Not Verified | Disappointed but not surprised. Flight scheduled at 1 pm gets cancelled 20 mins before take off and our rebook was scheduled for 3, it was then delayed two hours and then eventually also cancelled. Stranded at the airport for 48-hours, they did not compensate for our flight or for our hotel. Never flying American again, will fly Delta."
485,"  Our initial flight was a short flight from buffalo to Philadelphia, this flight was also delayed while sitting on air craft for hour and a half waiting to leave, finally it takes off, they didn’t offer anyone food or beverage, they said because of possible turbulence. I understand that but while we were sitting in ground, I feel they could have went around asking if anyone needed water or snack, nope they did not. My family and I had 3 delayed flights in 1 day after that with this American airline, the company had us running to all different gates with promises that we would be flying out. We would arrive to the gate hopeful, and in massive line, to find out that flight that will be departing is to Phoenix, then to Charlotte, I would go to desk, no one knew about my flight? How is it they can keep canceling my flight and not have any information when I could get my family home? American kept stringing us along, after sitting in Philadelphia airport from 2:30 till 10:30pm with 2 children, they ended up canceling last flight knowing there was a storm, that I think they knew about for hours, lady at desk said we are gonna board sooner to try and get everyone out before, they knew this flight was constantly delayed, you would think they would have been more organized to try and figure a solution for all of their customers. Others planes were flying out at this point, So then they told us to go by customer service with a huge line? So what I’m supposed to stand in this line for hours with 2 kids? After already traveling at this point since 10 am, Terrible, we couldn’t even get a opportunity to speak to someone about when can we go home. If you called on line it said a 2 hr wait for that. Then we get an email stated we would get another flight Monday evening at 7:30pm - are you kidding me? Mind you, we were at airport Saturday, who has 2 days just to sit in Philadelphia?  Then I wish it could end there - attempting to get my baggage was a joke, again we sat in line for an hour to speak to someone at the baggage claim desk, they were rude and letting everyone know that it’s been a nightmare for them for the last 3 days, and no one could get there luggage that night, maybe tomorrow?? The customer service people behind desk were more interested talking about their 50 th bday that was coming up, and days that she was scheduled but she was switching with another employee so she could be off or he?? As there is a huge line of people waiting, she said a couple of times we all are lucky that she cares to be there so much, because she wants to help, otherwise she normally already would of left for evening, up there yawning, saying how tired she was - are you serious? My family and I attempted to get a hotel /car rental.. on our own dime, could not find anywhere, everywhere was booked up."
486,❎ Not Verified | Phoenix to Portland. I guess we never learn our lesson. Last 3 times we have flown with them and every time the fight has been delayed or changed. They are never on time. And not accommodating to help you change.
487,"  Phoenix to Redmond. All those bad reviews, true. Very poor airline, trying to get to a loved one before she passes, they wouldn’t help me get an earlier flight and then the one I did have was delayed."
488,"  Grand Rapids to London via Chicago. American Airlines is the worst airline I have ever flown. Never have I been treated this badly before. It was just terrible customer service from the beginning to the end. I had three flights with AA. The first one from Grand Rapids to Chicago was delayed due to weather issues therefore I just made it to my second one which was also 30 min delayed. While I was trying to get the second plane AA rebooked me without my knowledge to a different flight ( Grand Rapids - Charlotte - Frankfurt). Had I not checked my emails would I not have known that they have done that. First off: as I had already left Grand Rapids and landed in Chicago this connection did not make any sense nor was it possible for me to take these flights. Second: they did not want to let me on my plane to London, which was the flight I had booked. It seemed that they did overbook the flight and therefore had problems getting everybody on the plane. Others who were rebooked on the flight I had booked originally were allowed to go whereas I was not. The crew was very rude to me and would just ignore me. They were unfriendly and just told me it was not their fault. They did not care about my case nor did they want to help. I had to beg them to help me. They ended up allowing me to go on the plane to London. They did not assure me a seat on my third flight the plane to Frankfurt although I had already checked in to this flight. In addition to that since I did make it on the plane to London I would have definitely made it to my last flight too. I also had a valid boarding pass for this flight. When I said I needed to get to Frankfurt they just said it was not their problem and they would get me to London but not any further. To “comfort” me (and I do not want to say this word as they did not show any emotion nor empathy towards me or any of the passengers) they said London was closer to Frankfurt than Chicago. While this might be true this is a sign of a big lack of customer service. Employees at AA do not seem to have been given ANY training on how to behave towards customers. I ended up crying because I just got so upset and they did tell me I might as well stay in Chicago and fly out tomorrow. Well thank you for being so compassionate. Never again will I fly with American Airlines again. To me it seems that they cannot handle the simplest problems or even normal situations related to flight delays and connections. You can definitely not expect anything in return from this airline. Stay away from them."
489,"Not Verified |  San Francisco to Charlotte. Worst customer service I've experienced with an airline. I get sick and claustrophobic in middle seats, and despite my obvious distress and discomfort, the crew refused to allow me to move to the open aisle or window seats because they are only available by charge, even though they are empty. A terrible policy, and awful management that they would make their crew feel they have no choice to move someone's seat even though they are visibly sick. Awful people, awful airline. This will be the last time I ever fly with American. Now I remember why I usually choose Delta for domestic flights. Unbelievably discourteous. Wish I could rate them at zero stars."
490,"  Denver to Charlotte. Absolutely awful experience. Rude, terrible service from the first class flight attendant. To make this a worse experience, this was followed by zero customer service after multiple emails contacting the customer service department. I would highly recommend another airline if given any other choice."
491,"  Chicago to Salt Lake City. I'm not surprised seeing that I'm not the only one who is disappointed with American Airlines. Whoever is in charge of customer service is doing a very poor job. My flight was delayed several times due to weather in Chicago. I get that, it happens. My disappointment begins when American refused to compensate me for my hotel room because I had to stay overnight in Chicago. I missed my connecting flight because they didn't get to Chicago in time, and they didn't have another flight departing for Utah after 9:30pm. The soonest they could do was 1:30pm the following day, so it's not like I could hang out at the airport for 15 hours. Then big surprise, I got another notification that my 1:30pm flight is now delayed enough to miss my other connecting flight! I called them and suggested the solution of putting me on a Delta flight at 7:50am. Why am I the one to figure out the solutions? I forward the complaint to Customer service; I ask them to compensate me for my hotel room ($129) and I may travel with American again. They tell me no. I explained that I travel every month for my job and they won't invest $129 to keep a customer. Obviously the return of investment is there for American airlines, but they couldn't see it. I've let my colleagues know (of whom also travel monthly) that I don't recommend flying with American. I already have another business trip planned for next week to Missouri and I booked Delta! Keep up the poor work American airlines, you'll have empty seats on your flights."
492,"  Phoenix to San Jose. At issue is American Airlines decision to reassigning my window seat 30A to a middle seat without my consent or any mention of this, later forcing me to change seat inside the plane. Upon entering the plane, my phone notified me that my seat had changed. I asked two cabin crew members where I should sit. They replied I should sit on my original seat, by the window, because it was less demanding on my foot. After having settled on my window seat and stored my bags in the top compartment, a family of 4 appears claiming they had the entire row assigned to them, seats 30A/B/C. The family appeared to consist of a small child, his parents and his grandmother. Another crew member told me that my seat was 12E and that I should move. I refused to do so since this was the seat I had purchased at least a couple months back and because I was told by the other crew members that I should sit there. A few moments after, the attendant came back and said that the captain had said that I can “either choose to change my seat or not board at all on the plane”. Intimidated by this and considering the fact that the plane was delayed and this family wanted to sit down and that I was extremely tired from the long trip, I moved my bags, changed my seat and apologized for the family since this was not their problem, but American Airlines. I will no longer fly with or recommend American Airlines."
493,  Bags were tagged with correct tags Charlotte to Dublin to Lyon but American Airlines sent one bag to Tampa. Bag found 2 days later but 4 days later still haven't even begun to forward them to me. No communication from American whatsoever. All info from call center in another country where they keep calling me to tell me that they have found my bag and they'll let me know as soon as they arrange to send it to me. Why are they holding the bag? They say they cant tell me. Dont fly American if you want your bags to go where you are going. They don't seem to care at all. Vacation is ruined because I'm spending all my time on phone and internet trying to get my bag. I go on vacation to get away from my computer and phone Thanks American Airlines for not caring!
494,"Not Verified |  Salt Lake City to Charlotte via Phoenix . Plane was late getting into Salt Lake City so we were late into Phoenix.. Was told that the connecting flight knows were are coming, so run. I’m a 60 year old Uterine cancer survivor of 2 months and I ran like a crazy woman! I ran past younger people that were on my flight (there was 14 of us) when I reached the gate they let a guy that I was on the plane with on but then closed the door! I said please I was on his plane and they said y’all are waiting on us. She said there are no more seats left that the plane was over sold. What? That is a connection flight for me. Not my flight of origin!? I asked at the customer service counter when they were booking my for another flight for 8 hours later how much did people get compensation for giving up their seat on my sold out flight and I was told nothing the 10 seats that weren’t filled by us passengers from my flight were given to people on standby! So I was bold face lied to by the attendant at the gate! Then the plane I was on after all the 8 hour of waiting barely got down the run way and we had to go back for engine issues. So an original flight time of 5 hours for me turned into a 21 hour circus and a missed day of work at $180 for the day. If I could give this airline zero stars I would! And a zero rating I would."
495,"Not Verified |  We were scheduled to fly from San Antonio to Chicago to Dublin. As we boarded the aircraft, we were told the plane was broken and we needed to wait for another plane to arrive from Dallas. 2 hours later, we boarded another aircraft. After we boarded it, we were told it was also broken. At this point, we were at risk for missing our connection. I spoke to the pilot and desk clerk who both assured me that the plane will be fixed very quickly and we will not miss our connection from Chicago to Dublin. In fact, they didn't want to rebook us on another flight at that time, as they were certain we would make our connection. 4 hours later, it was announced the plane was permanently grounded and there was no other plane they could put us on. Our connection was missed. We were rebooked on another flight out to Dallas now, with our international connection through now two different cities, getting us to Dublin 3 days after originally planned arrival. The next day, when we arrived at the airport and boarded the aircraft, we were once again told that the plane was broken and they would fix it shortly. At that point, we left the aircraft as everyone was screaming at us, asked a crew member to get our bags (airport crew, who was very helpful) and drove to Dallas where we got British Airways to get us to Europe. American refused to reimburse us in any way for this. They took no responsibility. We lost 3 days in our vacation time and expenses. All gate agents and customer service we spoke to was extremely rude and even yelled at us."
496,  Philadelphia  to Austin. American Airlines changed my departure time from 9AM to 4PM without any notice. They also changed my flight home from 1PM to 11 AM without notice. Im going to a convention so this time limitation creates unneeded stress. I will never be flying American Airlines again.
497,"Not Verified |  Flight was delayed but not announced until passengers were on board. This delay was over 1.5 hours causing us to miss our connection requiring an unplanned overnight stay in Philadelphia with a new flight the next day in the afternoon. LAX gate staff was rude and unhelpful. Customer service staff at LAX told us we could book on another airline, but we were on our own to contact, book and pay. In Philadelphia we were directed to the 50 person line at customer service where we were told our flight for the next day and we would be better off getting our own hotel. We were given a $12 voucher for each of us for food. We were not allowed access to our bags for medication for our 3 year old requiring. Fortunately, Marriott was able to find a 24 hour pharmacy once we checked in and paid on our own for rooms there. As of today, American has offered no assistance nor responded to us online or on the phone. We arrived home 24 hours later than scheduled."
498,"  Washington to Quito via Miami. My wife and I took a trip of lifetime to the Galapagos Islands this month and it was wonderful - except for our treatment by American Airlines. We booked first class tickets 9 months in advance and on half our flights, we were downgraded to coach because they oversold the tickets. I have spoken to six customer service representatives (you can never speak to the same one) and have yet to receive a refund for the difference in cost of first class and coach tickets (which amounts to thousands of dollars). And by the way, you cannot speak to anyone in the refund department. So if you still choose to fly American Airlines, don't expect to sit in first or business class even if you buy those tickets and good luck getting any money back once they downgrade you."
499," This has got to be the worst experience I ever had. Started out in Memphis our flight was supposed to leave at 7.35am, however there was something wrong with our plane and it took maintenance over 30 minutes to show up to fix the problem. By the time maintenance did show up thunderstorms rolled in (had maintenance been on time we would have left before the storms rolled in). Ended up leaving Memphis at 12pm and by that time had missed my connecting flight in Dallas at 12.35pm so they routed us from Dallas to Chicago. Nightmare gets worse, our gate and time changed 4-5 times sometimes without notification. Finally leaving for our final destination Sioux City IA at 10.26pm. Mind you my mother’s funeral was scheduled for the next day at 11am and there are not many flights in and out of Sioux City. Get to Sioux City, no luggage! Therefore no clothes or toiletries to shower before the funeral. We were told the earliest our luggage would be there is noon the day of the funeral, hence we had to purchase something to wear. Lucky enough we had money to buy clothes and toiletries. My last time flying American! Staff not friendly or empathetic and could have cared less what I was going through."
500,"Not Verified |  AA Advantage, not on this planet! After sitting on the runway for over an hour due to incompetent staff at O'Hare Airport (they couldn't get the crew the paperwork they needed to take off), I'm now reduced to sitting on the runway for another hour because of storms in the region. And the best part, American hasn't even updated my app to show the flight as delayed. Can't wait to tear my AA Card to pieces later this evening. And a bit of advice to American (even though they clearly don't seem to be able to either listen or take advice) just be honest and update the app. I know they can't do anything about the weather, but it was totally their fault they couldn't find their paperwork."
501,"  London to New York JFK. This was my first experience traveling on a basic economy fare. For the money I paid, it would be churlish for me to find any fault. I was assigned my seat when checking into a self service automatic machine. It was an exit row seat on the left third of the 3x4x3 configuration. When the doors closed and no passenger came to claim the window seat, I moved over to it. Lots of leg space, of course, but a toilet is in front which could be a nuisance. Blanket and pillow on the seats. Ear phones provided free. A dinner with choice of pasta or meat balls served soon after takeoff. I would have liked if they had a beverage service before the dinner. Wine and beer were complimentary. Before landing, a snack was offered - I chose the cheese rather than the pepperoni roll. Storage space overhead was not as spacious. For the fare, you could carry a regular cabin sized suitcase and another personal bag. Flight attendants were friendly. The selection of movies on offer was very small - I passed on them. Bathrooms had become untidy and had ran out of toilet paper. Plane landed on time but it was at least 25 minutes before we docked at a gate. It was the hot hot day in London when we started. A cold towel on boarding would have been a welcome relief. But overall, it was a very positive experience. And I received some frequent flyer miles too!"
502,"  American has started flying direct Munich to Dallas Ft Worth this month. I booked myself on one of the first flights. I picked a seat 1L, because I have already flown on AA 787-8 few times before. It is in a good area and it seems to have few extra advantages, one of which is not to have to face another person in awkward biz class configuration. American since left these seats and uses different manufacturer on 787-9 series. Munich airport terminal one is old and it is more than showing its age. I often fly out of PRG, which is much better and has better lounge. Onboard, the service was rather underwhelming, but definitely better than the next day connection from DFW to PSP on 737. (I will not even bother reviewing this, because AA has evidently given up on their domestic product - no drinks served, no food choice, rude service - .no point in a review as I mentioned). 787 is a great aircraft and after the take off came a quick meal service. When I say quick, I mean about 60 mins into the flight all of the meal service was served and the purser and flight attendants happily seated and chatting in front cabin. I have gone to the bathroom in front by the pilot's door at one point, only to be rudely ""thrown out"" by a blond flight attendent telling me the curtain was closed and to use other bathrooms. I quickly realized the reason for this. They were eating, drinking, playing their iPad games and I saw it all. I am not an arguing type, so I simply left, only to be called back by a somewhat nicer flight attendant, who ended up having an argument with the other over which bathroom I could use. Mortified, I proceeded to the bathroom, only to leave it few moments later with a deadly look by the blond flight attendant, who then went onto serving me my pre-arrival snack, by slamming it onto my table and giving me the evil eye. Oh American...it is HUGE understatment to say that as an Executive Platinum, who used to like the new AA is overall discouraged. I fly every month for business. Mainly LAX-LHR or SYD, I have seen the service to go steeply downhill in the past year and half, but nothing prepared me for this. Should I mention the horrible defrosted cold lamb offered submerged in what seemed like pieces of ice mixed with water and what remotely resembled potato puree? Or should I mention the red wine, which evidently could not beat $3 bottle of Chuck Shaw at Trader Joes? Amazingly upset stomach, horrible headache and 10 hours later, I finally reached my point of taking my business elsewhere. I also heard, AA is changing their frequent flyer award redemption, following DL nad UA (how about being a leader AA and being loyal to your customer base and keeping the current FF system, afterall you slashed 80% of the value only 2 years ago, do you need to screw us even further with your 5 billion dollar net profit?) to ""dynamic"" awards. I have left DL and UA for this very reason, and avoid flying them. I guess now it will be AA, unless they make radical changes to their service and treatment of the loyal frequent fliers. There are so many options out there from EU or Asian carriers. AA, don't underestimate word of mouth."
503,  Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. Flight was delayed two times back to back to the point that I won’t have missed my connecting flight to Pittsburgh because of ac issues!! Lost a day of work/ pay! Not offered to discount my ticket or anything.. Finally made it Philadelphia boarded plane only to be taken back off the plane on flight 901 again because of Ac issues again! Theres a reason why this airline gets a 3 out of 10 stars! Completely unreliable with customer experience left at the bottom of their to not do list.. sad sad airline
504,"  Buffalo to Washington. My flight was cancelled 5 hours before takeoff for alleged weather issues. There were no weather issues going on. We lost an entire day outfit our vacation. American Airlines changed our gates multiple times delayed our flight home, and we almost missed our flight."
505,"Not Verified |  
Los Angeles to Palm Beach via Charlotte. Terrible flight. Very little leg room. Internet didn't work. No TV. Flight arrived late to connecting flight in Charlotte. We only had 20 minutes to run across the terminal. I was out of breath. My son had to beg them to wait for me. After we arrived in PBI 6/27, late, our luggage was lost. It took 1.5 hours with baggage claim to locate it back in Charlotte. It never made it on the flight. We had to return to PBI the next morning, $30 Uber each way. It killed our day. That's the 2nd American Airlines flight in a row that was bad, never again. Delta or JetBlue for now on."
506,"  Honolulu to Phoenix. Worst service I think I’ve had while traveling. The security check point was a two hour long line or more. I had been standing in like for an hour my flight was going to board in 15 minutes and so I asked one of the crew members at the desk if they could do anything for me to avoid missing my flight. All they had to say was “sorry you will just have to try to make it in line or leave but that’s on you.” The crew member was pretty young, but regardless please be a bit more professional and do your job and at least try to service your customers. Meanwhile, the Alaskan Airline crew members were pulling people out of line so they didn’t miss their flight. I asked if I could join and told them my situation and they said I had to ask the airline I was traveling with, which I respected."
507,"  Philadelphia to Chattanooga. We were bumped off our flight Saturday morning (6am flight) from New Haven, 5 hours before it was due to depart. Re-seated on a 12:30pm flight. Which we made.. And flew to Philly.. Landed at Philly 1:15pm.. Sat around waiting for our 6pm flight to Chattanooga. 4pm announcement made ""all flights cancelled"" we were then sent e mail to say next flight we were booked on was 1pm following day. AA wont pay hotels etc..turns out so many flights cancelled that there wasnt a free hotel room for 30 miles from airport. We decided to drive 750 miles home instead. It took them 2 hours to find our bags before we could even start the 13 hour drive. We cancelled our flighys and are now awaiting refunds for the flights. We did however get an e mail 11am the next morning to say our 1pm flight was cancelled.. So next flight was 7pm It took us 16 hours to drive 750 miles home.. (Including stopping for food and gas) but we were still home before the 1pm scheduled flight. If we had stayed at the Philly airport we may still be there now.. AA are useless.. There were elderly people and young families stranded at the airport and no one cared. I will never.. Ever.. Flight AA ever again! Always flown Delta and never been bumped.. Let almone a flight cancelled with 2 hours notice. Avoid AA.. You'll regret it."
508,"Not Verified |  Dallas to New York. American Airlines is the worst. Flew a flight to NYC Friday, there were no seats left in business class so I had to fly economy. Went out of my way to pack a carry on, because AA lost my bag 2 weeks ago. I'm boarding and they seize my bag claiming there was no space in cabin, and when I tried to object they shamed me for booking boarding zone 7 (like I said there just weren't any seats left in business) I go to my seat and there are tons of cabin spaces available. So on the way home there did happen to be business seats available so I book those. "
509,"  Paid First from Austin to Atlanta via Charlotte. Both flights on refurbished A319 aircraft. Seats actually provide really decent legroom. No seat back IFE is a let down. Pre departure beverages on both flights, really nice lunch to CLT, Cheese Enchiladas and a decent red wine to go with it. Flight attendant did her job and did provide solid service, albeit, with out much personality. Connection to ATL a short 50 minutes in the air. Beverages and snacks were fine with a much friendlier flight attendant this time. Over all a solid trip with AA. If I have a complaint its the boarding and gate area chaos. AA consistently spills its passengers well into the terminals. Something needs to be done. I was in first, so priority security and boarding was enjoyed. I just felt bad for everyone else. I've been loyal to AA for decades now and have been lucky, as most of my trips are on time and I have always experience a fairly consistent level of service from them. Again though, I usually pay to fly up front."
510,"  New York to Charlotte. Flight was supposed to leave LGA at 7:59 am. First delay was until 10:00 am, second was until 2:00 pm. Then it was canceled at about 12:30 pm. By 10:00 am I knew it would be canceled because I ran into the AA maintenance crew chief at the food court and he told me that there was no way it was going back out today. Still AA jerked everyone around until 12:30 pm. Got a standby flight that was not nonstop but went to Atlanta and then to Charlotte. Didn’t leave NY until 2:30 pm. Got to Atlanta and the connecting flight to Charlotte was delayed for maintenance. How many maintenance issues does AA have? Sat in Atlanta through 3 delays. Finally left at 8:00 pm. Over 2 hours later than the flight was scheduled to leave. On top of everything else, in NY the guy made me check my bag at the last minute. No real reason other than that the plane was full. It was the same bag I flew to NY with as a carry on. That plane was full too. Have no idea if my bag will be in Charlotte when I arrive. I doubt it. All AA employees seem completely useless and they all have terrible attitudes. I’ll never fly American Airlines again. Their fleet is in poor repair and their employees are rude and incompetent."
511,"  Las Vegas to Charlotte. Not only did American Airlines change our flight three hours before leaving LV, they refuse to pay any of the room fees we incurred, they sent us to the wrong airport in NY and are refusing to help get us to the correct airport. Never again. "
512,"❎ Not Verified | Atlanta to Miami. Worse service ever. We got delayed because of bad weather in Miami. Landed into Fort Myers to get fuel. Upon inspection, there was a bulge in the tire. Tried to get our bags because we had a cruise to make by 7. The crew would not give to use because they “hoped” to have the tire fixed by then. 4 hours later not tire fixed try to get our bags again. Still a no. Finally by the 5th-hour tire not fixed and flight cancelled. Meaning we missed our cruise. No one could help us with vouchers or anything. I would not recommend them for anything!"
513,"❎ Not Verified | Dallas to Washington. Do not ever fly American Airlines at all, they are the worst airline, they cancel their flights last min and they are so rude that they won’t compensate you according to your convenience. It has been the fourth time within a month that they cancelled on me. They should stay outta business if they can’t provide good business."
514," Dallas to Houston. Airlines do not assign seating to allow you to sit next to the person you purchased the tickets with. If you buy two tickets, you will not sit next to that person unless you spend even more money than the ticket price you paid. Ridiculous. I will not fly with American Airlines again. To top that off the flight wasn't full at time of boarding the plane. The flight crew informed me that it was so they were unable to seat us together. That was a lie. They then started to fill those seats with people from a different flight since their flight was cancelled. The flight attendant told me a flight was cancelled and they needed to be on this flight. That's great they are doing that for another flight, but the customer already on the flight deserved precedence. They should have given priority to those already on the plane and filled the seats after. Not happy with this company and the way they care for their customers is lacking. They have a lot of work to do to be a better company."
515,"❎ Not Verified | Washington to Charlotte. I’ve flown with American 3 times in the past month and I can honestly say, worst airlines ever. I am a frequent traveler and they have to be the absolute worst. The flights are always delayed and they leave us on the plane without any information. I once had to wait 4 hours on a plane from Miami to Charlotte. Terrible inflight service. They truly do not care about their customers. I am currently on their aircraft waiting for my flight to take off, which is delayed yet again. I have been on this flight for an hour now just waiting to take off. Never fly American. You’ll waste your money and your time."
516, Columbia to Wichita Falls via Charlotte. We had a 2.5-hour layover in Charlotte. Then our plane was 2 hours late. They told me because my husband was 85 and had a stroke three months ago we would get a hotel. They lied. The ticket agent also told me to get my bag at Dallas. So I left my disable husband inside as I went to check on our bag. No bag to get. He's misinformed us and now I am stuck outside in baggage and my husband is inside. He needs me to talk for him and help him. So this is what America Airlines has gone to.
517," I spent an extended time away from my family for military training. My flight left at 3pm from Wisconsin and was expected to be home in Tennessee around 11pm. I got to the airport excited to go home and see my wife and kids, but my flight was delayed. And delayed again and again, until it finally left at 8pm. When I arrived at Chicago, I had missed my next flight and they would not help me in any way to find a place to sleep. I had been up since 3am and they said since it was due to weather it was not their problem. They rescheduled my flight to arrive home at 7pm the next day and refused to transfer me to another airline. To fix the situation, they gave me a $12 meal voucher. That was the value of the extra time I spent away from my family. Over a hundred Soldiers who left training with me got the same run around, but those who were able to hustle their way on to another airline arrived home way before the rest of us. I am still stuck over a thousand miles away from home and had to listen to my son cry on the phone because he wanted me home that day. American Airlines doesn't care about getting me home to my family faster, and they didn't care about the majority of Soldiers trying to do the same. If you can help it, don't use AA and stay out of Chicago airport, so you don't end up exhausted away from your family for double the amount of time with a $12 meal voucher."
518,"  I was scheduled to fly from Philly to Detroit on 6/28/2019 leaving at 3:15 pm and the flight was cancelled, and American lied to everyone why. First, were at the gate and the pilot announces there was 6,000 pounds too much fuel, and we needed to remove that excess fuel. That took a couple hours. We then head to the taxiway and sit for over an hour with no information from the pilot beyond we're waiting to learn where in line we were. Next thing is pilot announces he's ""timed out"" for the day, so we have to return to the gate, which we did. We deplane and they tell us new departure times for over an hour, saying they're looking for a new crew to fly the plane. Never once did anyone mention weather as an issue. Next we hear the flight is cancelled, there's no other flights to Detroit that night, and now they claim it's cancelled due to weather, so they won't cover anyone's hotel expense. They will refund the price of the ticket, but they won't cover the cost of a ticket on a different airline to get to Detroit. Ignoring the fact they never once mentioned weather as an issue, the Flightview.com website showed every other flight from Philly and other east coast cities heading to Detroit during the same period of time did not get cancelled or delayed due to weather. "
519,"Not Verified | Dallas to Honolulu. Horrible service. Third time I have flown with American Airlines, yet it's the second time my flight was delayed. The flight attendants don't tell you about the problem. After three hours they offer your cheap snacks and tap water!"
520," Tulsa to Grand Rapids via Dallas. Absolutely terrible airline. They delayed one of my flights, which put me in Dallas with very little time. Luckily, my connection was also delayed 30 minutes, so I arrived at the gate 10 minutes prior to the original time and 45 minutes prior to taking off. The flight attendant was incredibly rude and told me she couldn't let me on when though they were still loading passengers. I talked with her manager who said the same thing. They said I had already been bumped for a standby passenger, even though the flight want taking off for 45 minutes. If you want to be treated like garbage, fly American. If you want to be treated like a human, fly with anyone else."
521,"  Chicago to London. Most appalling experience, most of the staff is very uncordial, and least helpful. Both my flights from Detroit and to London got delayed, causing me to lose connection in London.  The flight from ORD to LHR got delayed more than 2 hrs due to technical Issues. On an long haul international flight these checks should have been done way ahead of time. Very bad experience."
522,"  La Guardia to Dallas Ft Worth. America Airlines customer service has been the rudest people I’ve ever encountered when flying. I know there is a lot of stress with flying and traveling and I believe that there needs to be people working at airlines to be polite. I flew from LGA and there is no help from the customer service desk especially when trying to check in a bag. The kiosks are mostly all self service, but there was not many people to help with checking in. They don’t have friendly smiling faces to help ease the stress of being at airports and flying. Being one of the biggest airlines in the world, their change flight fee is very expensive, the cost of checking in baggage and the size of overhead cabin space is small for a carryon. I’ve used a backpack to carryon before and they told me I had to check my bag even though the size of the backpack could fit the overhead cabin space. I have told myself that I would never fly with American again before since I had prior issues with this airline. I should have listened to myself."
523,"Not Verified |  First off, I would like to say that I never write reviews; however, American Airlines deserves something to be said about how awful they are. We travel very often as my husband is Australian. I have flown with over 10 airlines in the last 2 years. Since I am a one world partner, my preferred airline partner in the US is American Airlines. They are absolutely horrible. At least 50% of our flights are delayed and have mechanical issues affecting all of our connecting flights which obviously then have to be rescheduled. AA is completely unreliable. This is absolutely ridiculous and never happens to us on other airlines in our experience. American Airlines needs to get their act together!"
524,"  This was my first time flying American Airlines and it will probably be my last. The experience was beyond horrible & I'm truly in shock that this airline gets business. I flew from San Diego to Mississippi in the course of this travel I was stuck in two different cities, in total I flew on 8 airplanes. Too many mechanical issues on their planes and constant delays. My connected flight left me & I was stuck in Dallas overnight due to a plane delay in San Diego. I wasn’t rebooked until the next day for a flight that went to New Orleans instead, but AA sent my luggage to Mississippi. However my trip was worst coming home, I received a text about a two hour delay in Mississippi at the airport, yet again I had to miss my connector flight. Another night stranded with no luggage, and a flight that didn’t leave until the day after in the afternoon. I had missed work. My flight that was rebooked went from Charlotte to Dallas in which we had another delay at the Dallas airport. I made it home a day after my original travel schedule with multiple delays & being stranded in two cities. I have never in my life dealt with such a complicated travel experience. Worst airline I’ve ever flown in my entire life"
525,"  Pensacola to Detroit via Charlotte. Literally the worst experience I’ve ever had, my family of three was given delay after delay after delay, only to have our flight canceled at 2am (was supposed to be home at 7pm) because they couldn’t find the pilot. What should have been a 5 hour trip turned into 48 hours and getting home by car. Cost of round trip ticket was $429, refund for cancelled flight $104. This was after having to pay for a hotel and renting a car. We could submit a receipt if we had kept them in our exhausted brain fog. They then gave us issues with getting our luggage because we didn’t wait in Charlotte for another day to pick it up there. If they would have cancelled our flight right away due to the weather, I could have respected that, instead it was a big confused mess of nobody knowing what was going on and staff disappearing and timing out. We watched multiple fights being told their crew was on its way, their crew was there, time to board, and then sorry, never mind, your flight is canceled. I took out a AA advantage card to start getting points and had planned to make them my airline of choice. On second thought, I will not be flying with them again."
526,"Not Verified |  Des Moines to Tucson. First, our flight was cancelled. We had already checked out of our hotel and had to cancel an Uber. So we had to check back into the hotel. In order to get a seat on a new flight the next day, we had to pay extra (the only seats were first class), then once we checked into the airport the next day we were moved back down to Economy. I had called the customer service and confirmed it will take forever and a day to get our refund on the upgraded tickets but they refuse to give a credit voucher for having to pay for an additional day due to the cancelled flight. They had no problem putting others into hotels due to the inconvenience but my request for a credit voucher was ""separate"" somehow."
527,"Not Verified |  The flight to Charlotte was fine. But the last leg to Knoxville was cancelled due to weather. The next plane was cancelled and the one after that was two hours late and full. The customer service in this situation was woefully inadequate. “ phone the number on this blue slip and they’ll sort a hotel for you “ they said. Nope. Google it yourself and sort out your own hotel is the reality. 19 calls later I found a hotel at $200 at 2am. It’s not “customer service”, it’s customer indifference. I have to fly back to the UK soon and I am dreading it, given what happened to me."
528,"Absolute worst airline I have ever flown with. Was supposed to fly out of Columbia on 6/24 with a layover in Washington, flight got delayed and would cause me to miss connecting in Washington. Got rebooked on a flight to Chicago which also got delayed causing me to miss the connecting. Flew out at 6am of Columbia to Washington the on 6/5, got on to plane to head to Boston and we all had to deplane that flight was then cancelled and delayed until 10am, then 2:05pm, then 4:36 pm. Would give 0 stars if possible."
529,"  Providenciales to Chicago via Charlotte. This is the first review I have ever written. We had a girls trip planned to Barcelona for 5 days, for our direct flight, without much explanation, our flight was delayed 5 hours and cancelled. American offered us ""food vouchers"" if we went online, had no options to rebook us that weren't 4 days away ( thats the whole trip), and were extremely rude in the process. We made lemons into lemonade, cancelled our trip, and went to the only place we could go last minute through American for 6 people, Turks and Caicos. On our flight back out of Charlotte, we were delayed 5 hours and the flight was cancelled. Zero Reimbursements. Zero Help. They wont help with hotels, food, or rebooking. We got ourselves on now a connecting flight tomorrow and have to sit up all night at the airport waiting. Everyone has been rude, no vouchers, no reimbursements. Luckily I have all night to write reviews ( go big or go home once you start I suppose). I would NOT fly American, I have been a loyal customer for years, and this treatment has been appalling. Fly United or Southwest."
530,"  Our flight was from Ottawa to Miami with one stop at Philadelphia. This one stop was nightmare! It is unacceptable the way my sister and I were treated by AA staff at the Philadelphia airport. Our flight was delayed 45 min from Ottawa to Philadelphia. when we arrive to Philadelphia AA staff send us from one customer service office to another one, refusing to help us. Then from one gate to another one... needless to say the airport is huge and we walk the Whole thing hoping to get some assistance... At one gate a customer service rep told us, ""you have your seats on the next flight to Miami, I want to print it but my printer is not working... please go to gate XX the flight will be leaving soon"" What a big lie! when we finally arrived to the gate where the flight was leaving, we found out we didn't have seats! I explain to the customer rep that our flight with AA was delayed 45 min, so we lost our connection flight from Philadelphia to Miami (with AA), we need to be in Miami today. Could you please put us on the next flight to Miami? if AA does not have flights going, could you please put us on a flight with another company. She answers  the next flight its tomorrow at 3:00 pm."
531,"  Dallas to Oklahoma City. American Airlines is the absolute worst airline I have ever flown. They canceled all flights to our city for weather when there was no weather in either the destination, the departure or in between. They did not have any flights the next day. he previous week, after they changed our flight with no explanation and bumped us from the first class seats we paid for, they refused to offer any help or refund our money. As a result of the vast quantity of cancellations from AA the car rental places in DFW no longer offer one way rentals because it is too expensive to get the cars back from the destinations. The only response I have received on any of these issues is that they can’t do anything because it’s out of their hands. They do not care about customer service in anyway. Every staff member was so rude, not helpful and just had zero interest in doing their job. I will go out of my way to never fly American Airlines ever again. They get a 1 because you can’t even give them a zero rating."
532,  Charlotte to Lynchburg. We were on our way home to VA from CA. When we were waiting to take off from CA the pilot came across the intercom and said that we were going to be late because we were waiting on some other folks who were late to the gate to board. Because that family was late the whole plane was late to get to NC. And myself and several other passengers missed our flights. I just don't understand what was so special about this family you can hold a whole plane and ruin everyone else's flights. Now we have to sleep on the floor of the airport. We won't be able to go back to our jobs tomorrow and missing a whole day of work is a big chunk of change. I don't understand is why were we set up on a flight that was scheduled to land at 940 and have a connecting flight that also starts boarding at 940. This same thing happened to me last year at the same time. I'm fed up with American Airlines.
533,"  Memphis to Cancun via Charlotte. American Airlines is awful! This is 2nd year in a row had major issues. Last year computer system went down. This year we boarded , sat down and told to get back off because damage to plane. They knew this before we boarded! No connections to destination left. Customer service agents for American were rude and did not care. Didn’t even bring snack, waters until 2 hours later. Over a hundred passengers stood in line for over 2 hours and then they moved us again to different gate twice to go nowhere. Long story short ruined a family vacation and most people could not get where they were going unless 2 days late. We had to get refund for our family trip! Makes you wonder how well they maintain their planes. If I can avoid will never fly them again. I’d give them a 0/10 but must pick 1/10!"
534,"Not Verified | Our flight was originally from Tulsa to Dallas to Ft Myers, 12 hours prior they cancelled Tulsa to Dallas flight with no explanation. We call, set on hold from 9:00 pm to 12:00am only to be hung up on 3 times. They finally call back at 3am after we had come to the conclusion we would have to drive 5 hours to catch connecting flight in Dallas. Their solution was to move us from Monday to Wednesday flight. What! So we just miss two days of our trip? We tell them no we will just drive to Dallas and that we want compensation. They tell us to complete travel and then they would. Lie! We call them back again and find a flight out of Oklahoma to Dallas to Ft Myers which is two hours away. So we start our trip with no sleep, two tired kids, and driving two hours away to catch a flight. They could care less. Then 12 hours before our flight home the cancel flights and we have to drag two kids through 4 connections to get home. Then drive two hours in. They will not compensate. They say it was weather but nowhere in our path was there bad weather. However all over the news it was announced they downed hundreds of flights due to mechanical issues. I will not fly with them again!"
535,"  My flight Chicago to Newarkwas delayed for more than 2 hours. After take off for 10 minutes, the captain announced that the plane had a fuel leakage and we were turning back to ORD. We had to deplane for an inspection. As a replacement aircraft needed to be located, the flight was delayed for another 3 hours. We boarded the replacement plane. After the boarding procedure was complete, the captain announced the right front tire needed to be replaced and we needed to deplane again. After we go off, the flight got delayed for another 3 hours to 9pm. At this point, I have had enough with this ridiculous nonsense, so I rebooked my flight to AA 1652. AA 1652 delayed to 7:25pm. It was originally scheduled for 6:30pm. The ground staff at the gate said she would inform me if my checked baggage made it onto this flight after everyone had boarded, but she NEVER got back to me. Very irresponsible. When I got to LGA, the ground staff first told me my bag was on the plane, but later on said it was still on AA 1834 to Newark as my bag never appeared on the baggage belt. They informed me that the baggage could be delivered throughout the night, so I provided them with my hotel address. After AA 1834 landed, I called the AA baggage hotline and they told me the complete opposite. They said the baggage will have to be delivered the next day. I have had enough of this nonsense and I needed my suitcase the next day for an important meeting, so I took an UBER to pick up the baggage myself. When I picked up my baggage, the zipper was open and taped together loosely with AA tape. I've been using this suitcase for more than 3 years and this is the FIRST TIME it has popped open with the zipper head still locked. I wonder how in the world AA handled my baggage. I sent a complaint to AA to be compensated for my two UBER rides. The first one to my hotel (as I assumed my baggage would be delivered to me) and the UBER round-trip to pick up my luggage. I also asked to be compensated for the 10 hour delay. I was originally suppose to be in Newark by 3:14pm, but I ended up getting to New York at 10:56pm and having to pick up my luggage at 1:39am in the morning. I did not sleep till 4am. AA is a stingy airline and only compensated me with a $100 transportation voucher. I have had the worst ever possible experience on AA."
536,"  Miami to Pensacola. Flight was canceled due to weather. They made us wait more than 20 hours for the next flight (originally was going to be about 26 hours) and they did not provide us any type of accommodation. We had to sleep in the airport floor. When it was finally time to leave we had issues yet again. They almost did not let us board and they ended up taking people out of the plane to let us in. (We had priority since we had reserved our seats and they were stand by). Horrible experience. I understand it's not the airline fault that the weather was bad, but the least they can do its provide us with a place to sleep since we had to wait a while day to be able to leave. Also the people that were stand by had been in the same flight at us and have been waiting the same amount of time and they made them leave the plane after seating them down."
537," The seats were comfy, the cabins were cool temp and the inflight entertainment was very good. That's about all the positive things I can say about American Airlines. We had 4 flights throughout our vacation and every one was over booked by a least 5 people delaying the on boarding time 30 minutes at a minimum. You purchase a specific seat on American! How can you over book! Then after we boarded our 7.05am flight from Dallas to St. Louis we sat on the plane for 3 hours because of some instruments misreading numbers. They informed us there was a problem and that we would leave in about 30 min almost immediately after boarding. Great, except 2 hours later we were still sitting there an no one would give us any information and they we not letting us off. Finally left the airport at 10.00am. Lastly, we were not offered food on the 6 hour flight from LAX to Hawaii, and the food we were offered on our 7 hour flight from Hawaii to Dallas was slimy and not even remotely appetizing."
538," San Jose Cabo to Tampa via Dallas with American Airlines. My wife and I spent two days waiting to get out of Mexico and was told the day of cancelation that the plane had mechanical issues and was told a new plane would come in the following day which never happened. Put on stand by and did not get out until the following day, my wife and I both missed 2 days of work and lost 50 pounds of fish. When I call American I was told it was weather which was not a true statement, the rep could not care less and when I asked to speak to her supervisor she stated she did not have one."
539,Not Verified |  Was on a 12.20 flight from Philadelphia to Phoenix. It’s almost 5 pm now and I am still sitting in PHL. Finally changed planes after 3 plus hours of “evaluating” the engine problem. Airlines need to be quicker to react. Now we might see further delays due to weather. What a nightmare American Airlines!
540,"  Miami to New York. Most Horrible experience ever. More than 4 hour delay because you loss your flight crew is unacceptable. First you keep us almost two hours on flight waiting, then you take us out, tell us you lost the pilot and we need to wait, the you say you found pilot but lost flight attendants. Can you people get it together. To be such a big airline, you do provide the least reliable service. AA also refused to compensate you for anything."
541,"Not Verified |  I have flown with all the major airlines since 1958 and I must say that without a doubt I must rank American Airlines in the top 3. This was demonstrated on a recent flight to Florida, I required wheelchair assistance and the service was provided with a spirit of excellence. During the flight I had a stroke and the cabin attendant found a nurse that came and gave the medication to aid in a speedy recovery. Your team insured that my medical problem was handled in the manner possible. I know that airlines have had a ot of negative comments about service, but you have proved them wrong. Thank you for great service and I will seeing you again next flying to Chicago."
542,"Not Verified |  American Airlines is horrible, both the trip out to the west coast and the trip back had problems. On our 5+ hour flight from O’Hare to California we had paid extra money for more legroom and complimentary drinks, our flight from Moline to O’Hare was changed and so we were given alternate tickets for the O’Hare-San Diego leg which didn’t include what we paid for. On the way home AA changed our gate multiple times in O’Hare making us move from G gates to K gates and by the time we arrived at the K gate they had switched us back to a G gate. I will never fly American Airlines again."
543,"  Nashville to Bismarck via Dallas Ft Worth. Easily the worst airline experience I’ve had. On my flight out, I was delayed for unknown reasons so much that I missed my connection and was stranded overnight in Dallas. The airline refused to help me reroute despite my best attempts. I know things happen and I was put up in a hotel so I wasn’t too upset about it. However, 2 days later on my return flight, it was again delayed so much that I missed my connection and was forced to stay overnight in Dallas again. Once again, no assistance or attempt to make the situation right. This time, I wasn’t even offered a hotel. I’m not sure how this joke of a company still has any customers but I’m sure they won’t last much longer if they continue to treat passengers this way."
544,"  I am flying from Jackson to El Paso. I got fly connection in Fort Worth I suppose to get to El Paso at 11:49 and I still waiting at 7:25 they make everybody wait all this time “over 9 hours with out telling us that the fly will be canceled. We went to costumer service “about 150 people “ to see what’s next and they offer us a fly until Tuesday “today it’s Sunday"". Now the best they can do is putting all that people on stand by expecting some other people don’t show up so they can send us to El Paso.  I am so disappointed, I just remember they offer to pay just a half of the hotel “but is not our fault “."
545,"Not Verified |  Decent experience. Three of the four flights were on time. Most of the cabin crew were friendly. Ground staff in EWR and LAS were friendly as well, although some of the staff in CLT are a bit dismissive. One of the engines on the plane from CLT to EWR failed to start, but the airline was quick and efficient in finding a plane to fly the route. This did result in an hour delay, but the efficiency of the crew was admirable. Seats on the B737 are a bit cramped, but the A321 is spacious and comfortable. Unfortunately no seatback entertainment, which is odd considering most other airlines have it, although you can download the American app and watch free movies and TV inflight on a smart device. No real choice in snacks, but a decent drink menu. I would personally recommend American over Delta or United, although my opinion may be unpopular."
546," The recent change to not being able to select your seat (without an up charge of at least $10) was pretty frustrating that flying cheap means you will be forced to sit in the middle seat every time. What is not acceptable are the advertisements that are now played on the TV headrest while you are waiting to exit the plane. If you are using the entertainment system to watch a show, advertisements are to be expected. However while everyone is sitting there in gridlock to play advertisements on every TV and removing our ability to skip it or turn the TV is unacceptable. I refuse to be forcibly subjected to content I consider abhorrent. I will not be watching these ever again."
547,"Not Verified |  American Airlines has successfully ruined our first family gathering in Boston at our daughter's home. We arrived early at LAX to avoid rushing through the TSA section. Well that plan immediately fell apart when the flight was delayed around 2 hours. We ended up sitting at the airport for around 4 hours and getting to Boston after midnight, missing the late night festivities. To make matters worse, my son's flight today from LAX to Boston has been delayed by 5 hours. I suggested to my son that it will be perfectly all right if he just canceled his trip. This may not sound as bad as others who I am sure have encountered 24 hour delays but the airline industry should be more prepared to ensure family's get for they paid for. My family will go out of our way to avoid using American Airlines."
548,"  Cleveland to Dallas. The last three times I flew, my baggage was check in for free because of my wife being in the military. She FaceTimed me and spoke to two of the attendance at the airport. However, this last time, my bags were not able to be checked in for free because I was told she has to be here. The agent, was extremely rude and disrespectful towards be and proceed to tell me that there was no way he could help me. I then, showed him my previous baggage tickets that I had before that were checked in for free. He then told me there’s nothing I can do. “American is sometimes discombobulated” in his words. I was so upset, I had to throw out half of my luggage even the items I brought to take to my wife for her surprise 25th birthday. American is horrible. The customer service is extremely unprofessional. I am a general manager and I have never given such careless service before in my life. In a job, you are to make sure things are taken care of, and this time they werent by far. American will never receive another dollar from my wife or myself, because of the terrible service, and even after I walked away, he started to laugh which made me more confused and frustrated that I wasn’t able to receive help, but I could receive ignorance? Great job, American."
549,  Austin to Nashville via Dallas. I will never be flying through this airline company again. They change gates at the last minute (multiple times in our case). They cancelled our first flight and we had to continue to try for oversold standby flights throughout the day. Customer service and gate agents don’t care to communicate properly with their customers that are stuck in flight limbo. I would leave a 0 if I could.
550,"  Orlando to LaGuardia. This was the absolute worst, most chaotic experience flying of my life. After being delayed 8 times and cancelled 4 I finally got on another flight via JetBlue that I had to pay for out of my own pocket since AA is a joke. My flight was due to depart at 8:27 pm yesterday and I wasn’t on an aircraft until 6:30 am today. Customer service is useless and to be frank, they’re straight up rude. I basically threw away money, potentially risked my job as I’m missing work today and lost 12 hours of my life on a “2-hour” flight. You’re the worst AA, I wouldn’t fly again if it were free, it’s like asking for a 12-hour migraine."
551,"Not Verified |  Was putting my son on the plane by himself, which means he has a flight attendant helping him until his final destination. He had put my wallet in his backpack (carryon) and I didn't realize until he was already on the plane. I rushed back to the terminal and even though the gates were closed they had an American Airlines attendant go retrieve it for me! Wendy and Jennifer were their names in SLC Airport I am so grateful! My ID and credit cards were in there! Lol"
552,"Not Verified |  This was the worst experience with American Airlines. Our flight in SLC was delayed because of “staffing issues” in Dallas. This made us miss our connecting flight, which mind you left 5 minutes early. No one was willing to help us in Dallas and we had a very hard time getting accommodations as it was almost midnight. Everyone was rude and not helpful. By our own means we found a hotel and got a way to get there. They then promised a seat and a standby spot for a flight the next day, but the seat promised was an empty promise. Who knows if we will ever get to our destination. Worst airline ever!"
553," London Heathrow to Dallas Fort-Worth with American Airlines. Last year I have flown Business Class with the same airline, same route, same plane and I was impressed. This time I have decided to opt for Premium Economy instead. The product is solid. I was on the first row which has a leg rest and it surely makes a difference. But the crew were friendly and professional. Toilets were clean. The food was really delicious. I was impressed."
554,"❎ Not Verified | Philadelphia to Orlando. Never, ever, fly this airline. I wish I could say I'd never fly them again, except they've essentially taken over Philadelphia International and it's hard to find other airlines to fly somewhere. On June 7th I had an 11:00 a.m. flight that was cancelled for ""technical difficulties"". No notice, and all the passengers had to scramble to find other flights. American didn't offer to put us on another airline, they put us on a flight at 7:45 p.m., which meant I would miss the first night of a two day meeting I was headed to. After a day waiting at the airport I got on my plane, which had a malfunctioning nose gear, which forced it back to the terminal. After being told it had been repaired, we left again only for it to malfunction again. The flight was then cancelled. I don't know how a large airline like American doesn't have contingency plans for these eventualities. Between parking and lost hotel fees I lost over $300, not to mention lost PTO and just a general loss of my day. American offered me nothing for this, nor did it offer something as simple as a meal voucher for hanging at the airport all day. When I wrote to complain they gave me 7500 frequent flyer miles, which is fairly insulting. To make it worse, a friend flying to the same meeting was given 10,000 miles. When I wrote to ask why they said that complaints were handled on an individual basis and they wouldn't match the 10,000 my friend received. Bottom line, American Airlines has terrible service and if they screw you, your only recourse is to say ""Thank you sir may I have another!"" Don't fly them if you can avoid it!"
555,Not Verified |  AA would not assign a seat prior to flight because they only had exit row seats available and stated they would be assigned at check in with gate agent. These were the only seats available and cost extra and they wanted people to buy them. Arrived at airport to about 80 people in line with American Airlines trying to get seats assigned. Was assigned a seat through the app with 20 min prior to flight leaving and had to race through TSA and was last person on and gate agent told me I was late and I needed to hurry up when they had just issued me a pass when I checked in the day before.
556," Dallas to Morelia. One of the worst experiences with this airline, I had several experiences but this was the worst. American Airlines canceled our flight from Sunday, in a different country and all they said was that it was due to air traffic. The worst thing was that they didn’t even bother to accommodate transportation to nearby airport and the next flight was not until Tuesday loosing two days of work. They treat customers poorly and don’t care about anything, only money."
557,"  Salt lake City to Dallas Fort Worth. Worst trip. Every time I have flown, there has been a delay with little to no communication. My most recent flight was delayed several times and then cancelled. They did nothing to accommodate and then I booked another flight with them the next day that was delayed by four hours inclusive of sitting in a parked plane for over an hour both before take off and after landing."
558,"  Manchester to Philadelphia. This was the worst flight i have ever taken in my life. The airplane was awful no plugs to charge the phone, no TVs ear plugs did not work. Hostesses were very rude. Seats very very small and crowded. The bathroom did not have toilet paper or paper towel. I would never in my life recommend American airlines to anyone ."
559," Reno to Huntsville AL via Dallas. Before leaving RNO the next flight was cancelled. When I arrived at DFW I was told I’d be on standby for next flight. That flight was cancelled as well as the next 4, each time a different excuse for the flight being cancelled. Never was it weather related. I left Reno 37 hrs ago and I’m still at DFW, booked on a 6:34 pm flight again! The agents are rude and obviously don’t care about customer relations. Never again American! The worst trip I’ve ever taken and it’s not over yet."
560,"Not Verified |  This flight was made round trip from Lawton to Abe and back again. Literally just about every leg of the journey was grossly late. The best and most entertaining part of the journey was in Dallas when the terminal was changed about three times and the gate changed again after the final terminal change. This caused me to have the wonderful opportunity of running all over the Dallas Airport which is massive. Luckily, since the fight was going to be quite late again I had the time to do this. I got my cardio in for the day because of this so it wasn't too bad I suppose. I will never give these people my money again and next time will suck it up and make the extra drive to Oklahoma City to fly Delta like I usually choose to do."
561,  Dallas to Asheville. The worst experience I’ve ever had flying. No help from anyone. Stayed here for two days. No one wanting to help or understand. I’ll never fly American again. This is a joke.
562,"  New York to Columbus via Dallas Ft Worth. My son was stranded for over 12 hours in Cincinnati Ohio June 9th. His connecting flight got postponed 3 times then cancelled and was given no plan or solution. I waited on hold for w hours yes 2 hours (only a mother could understand) to speak to a supervisor from American airlines when the agent  finally got on phone she was as helpful as the representative at the airport. I explained my sons situation and told it appeared that their was another flight leaving with a connection in Charlotte now that the 3 others had been cancelled could we please see about booking him on any of these 2 flights she continued to tell me they were booked and my sons only options was Tuesday morning ""what kind of option was that"" I told her he could not afford to stay in Ohio but she gave me no answer just she could book him on flight Tuesday morning cause she could not over book lady please I have flown many times with American airlines and have been at airport when they offer money for people to stay for next flight cause they over booked. I told her Tuesday was not an option that he would need to return to NYC she now said he would have to use is returning ticket to fly back. Thanks again for all your not help. He got on plane back to NYC Monday and guess what we got - nothing. You won't be doing business with me or anyone I can talk out of doing business with you. No service and for no efforts in trying to help a customer out."
563,"Not Verified |  I booked and confirmed a flight from Philadelphia, PA to Denver, CO for a family reunion, even printed the boarding passes. At 3am. I got a text message indicating my 8am flight was cancelled due a crew-related problem. American Airlines could not find a crew to fly my plane, imagine that. No crew to fly my plane, I hope they have a a sufficient number of qualified mechanics to maintain the plane. I have been a faithful customer for more than 30 years and this is the way they treat their long-term customers. No offer of a voucher, booking on other airlines, nothing! I would like to rate the other services such as cabin service, seat comfort, etc but I never got on the plane"
564,"  Boston to Columbia via Charlotte. Super delayed flight. It’s a small flight with flight hour of just 25 mins but, the taxi apparently takes more than 1hr. They have been super bad every-time. Either delayed flights or canceled flights they always have a reason to make sure they get the worst reviews."
565,"Not Verified |  Philadelphia to Jacksonville. On June 3, 2019 Flight 4547 I was accommodated by an employee at Gate C21 by Miss Snyder just before boarding. She ordered me a wheelchair on the spot as I had much difficulty with my luggage because of a health issue. She also moved my seat up to 8A which was very comfortable and made arrangements for a wheelchair at JAX airport when I arrived. I found her professional, caring and a credit to the airline. She suggested that under my circumstances, I should ask for this accommodation when I book online since I had such difficulty."
566,"Not Verified |  San Antonio to Chicago via Syracuse. Arrived an hour early for my flight.. All I needed to do was check in my bag. Where I stood in line for curb bag check in. Waited 10mins and was told I had regular bag check-in and I had to go inside. There was no big line to get my boarding pass thru the kiosk screen. A rep from AA pointed me to one and told me to scan my online boarding. She did not let me know that I need to print my baggage slip. So I got my boarding pass and proceeded to clerk to check my bag in. At that time it was 7:25 am and that I needed to print one slip thru the kiosk system.. I fiddle with the screen and tried to print one out. By that time it was 7:30am. Another lady fro AA came up and said that I would need to change my flight. And made me get on a big line. Which made me lose my flight. TSA security was not busy at all at this time. Instead of this lady saying let check this in for you and you can board. Bags Will arrive to your destination later. I waited and to my luck they had no more available flights till tomorrow. The guy who changed my flight said I didnt have to check it in at the terminal. That I could of gone in and at the gate they would check it in. I spoke with the manager but he was no help at all just had a wise remark of ""bags need to be check in before boarding time."" He didnt bother even looking to assist with trying to help. I would never spend my money on anything American Airlines."
567,"  Destin-Fort Walton to Charlotte via Richmond. Flight AA2926 from CLT to RIC on Jun9 at 11:45AM has been canceled. We're working to rebook you and will send an update soon. Flight AA5623 from VPS to CLT on Jun9 at 6:18AM has been canceled. We're working to rebook you and will send an update soon. 6:15 am flight, be at airport 2 hrs early, traveling with 2- 6 year old children. While standing in line 4:52 am to check luggage I received a text that flight had been cancelled. No one offered to reschedule our flights nor did anyone apologize for our inconvenience. We were given a phone number to call and rebook our flights. Next flight 9 hours later. Wasted day. Expensive changing transportation. My time has value. Why does anyone work for this company? I had the same thing happen on my flight coming out to Florida now I’m trying to get home to va with 2 grandchildren. Traumatic for all of us. No one from that company said sorry or tried to help. Never again will I fly this airline. The only positive thing I can say is the flight attendants on the plane were awesome flying to Florida."
568,"Not Verified |  Terrible airline. They go out of their way to show that they do not value customer loyalty, convenience or comfort - they only view customers as 'little bags of money' for them fleece in the name of profits. This company has lost its morality in its relentless pursuit of customer misery. Seats are too narrow and leg room is terrible. Food is not great. Ground staff are so rude it's perplexing and cabin crew are so thoughtless, rude and resigned to a rubbish product that they don't even try to make it better for customers. I fly foreign carriers overseas whenever I can to avoid American Airlines."
569,"  Avoid American codeshare partners if you expect any customer from American. Booked this flight as American 8294, knowing it was operated by code share partner, but thought that meant as a Platinum AA member that I'd at least have an advocate in the case of problems. NOPE! Flight into MEX was delayed as plane had to divert to Acapulco to refuel and missed our connection. Took 4 hours for AA codeshare (Interjet) to get us boarding passes for flight the next day and they never told us where our luggage was. Thanks to kind and trusting security agent we did get luggage retrieved. Had to overnight in airport hotel @$275. Applied to travel insurer for compensation, not to AA codeshare. All I need from AA codeshareis confirmation that flight was delayed 2 hours. It has been 8 weeks and they won't even respond. Emails say ""we are glad to help you, under review"". Phone is never answered. AA told me they can't help me as it was an AA codeshareflight. They take no responsibility for their code share partner, even to communicate with them. Don't fly Interjet and don't think booking with a code share partner will get you any service from American."
570,"Not Verified |  Newark to Austin via Dallas fort worth. I had the worst airline experience today. First my flight from Newark to Dallas was delayed 1 hour 30 minutes because the pilot was a no show. This caused us (traveling with family) to miss out connecting flight to Austin. To make matters worse my baggage was delayed as well. When I was finally able to track it down. The ppl in customer service were so nasty, rude and unaccommodating to the point that I had to go back to the airport 9 PM to retrieve my luggage. This is by far the worst experience I've ever had while traveling. I will certainly not use this airline again, nor will I recommend."
571,  Liberia to Dallas Ft Worth. This is by far the worst airline when handling delays and cancellations. The entire airport was closed however every other airline managed to take care of their passengers and did not have 2 hour line the following day. They are unhelpful and rude and then on the rebooked flight the steward continued to repeat that this was pretty much our rescue flight! Are you kidding me! Are you doing me a favor I don’t think so. I will never fly this airline again.
572,"  Phoenix to Boise. The kiosk Check In is slow and asks to many questions to get you to pay more. Which takes several minutes instead of asking it all on one screen. If you have a problem the front can’t help you and refer you back to an assistant which takes more waiting. Then I arrived to my gate 8 mins before my flight was to leave and the attendant was very slow wasting time Loking for a number to call. Insisted she go to the door and check she barely moved down the aisle and then said it’s too late. Customer service wasn’t much better, she found me a flight but said I was on my own for finding a hotel"
573,Not Verified |  New York to London. The seats are fantastically uncomfortable. They fit 10 seats across in a Boeing 777. No leg room. The food was inedible. Miserable flight. Would not recommend going across the ocean on American.
574,"  Miami to Bogota. I have been sending mail, e-mail through contact, claim through BBB since May 19th and I have not gotten any answer from American just the automatic reply email. SO, I would like to express my disappointment and dissatisfaction with the service I received recently from American Airlines.  I had a trip scheduled for 05/05/2019 Miami to Bogotá leaving at 9:40 pm. that was canceled at 11:00 pm. This caused me expenses, American reassigned me to flight AA-915, leaving Tues. 7 at 5:35 pm. I could not lose two days of work, so I had to rebook for Sunday 05/12/19 AA-915. On 05/12/19 the flight was delayed again several times from 5:30 p.m. We board at 9:00 p.m, but at 11:30 p.m. we were informed that flight would leave the next day at 11:15 a.m. Again, expenses for no show Hotel in Bogota. I had to pay for hotel on 05/12 at Miami and taxi to the hotel shuttle was not working. Vouchers I received from American staff at 12:30 am, were wrong. The name was different that my name. I made the claim about what happened to American before leaving for Bogota on May 13th, by phone at 6:00 am, and through passenger service staff at gate 14 at Miami airport. In both cases I was kindly treated and informed that I have to make the claim through customer relation “aa.com/refunds” attaching the receipts and any relevant document. As I mentioned, all this situation has caused me significant losses that I asked them to be compensated by you as soon as possible but still nothing."
575,"Not Verified |  I have had awful experiences with this airline and will most likely never travel with them again. Back in April 2019 I was traveling to see my family up in Boston. I was 28 weeks pregnant at the time. I was in the airport for 7 hours! My first flight was delayed due to wind (which was understandable). The second flight, everyone had gotten on the plane and after we were all boarded was told that we had to deplane due to the toilet not flushing. So then the third time around we got fully boarded again and then was told they had to inspect the plane(which took 45 min). After that, once again, we had to deplane and were also told that they had to find a plane and weren’t sure we were going to get one. We were told we were going to be fed but never were given anything. Then on the final flight we had to wait 25 min before we could takeoff waiting on other planes to take-off. I wish this was the end of my awful experience with this airline but it isn’t. Now, my sister had booked a flight for July , paid $60 per ticket for ticket changes and $40 for insurance for her and my moms flight in case I went into labor early and they had to change flights. Well, I ended up being diagnosed with icp and need to be induced June 17th. So, since my sister paid for ticket changes she called them to try and change the flight but was told that the $120 that she paid for was “just to skip the line and get on the flight quicker” and because I “wasn’t in the hospital right then they couldn’t make any exceptions.” If I were you I would pick a different airline, they are the cheapest airline around for a reason with no courtesy for any of their customers."
576,  Philadelphia to San Diego. I always forget how much I hate flying American Airlines. They separate you from people you book your flight with on purpose so that their customers have to pay to switch their seats. Then they make me check my bag when there is all this extra cabin space. I’m just annoyed and frustrated at this whole experience. This is why Southwest Airlines is taking over.
577,"  Los Angeles to Buffalo via Chicago. What a terrible treatment of passengers. The flight attendant yelled at me for drawing her attention when I asked her a question and she passed me by for water/snack. This is the only airline that has their crews completely ignore the passengers when during leaving the plane. Customer treatment by the flight attendants is ZERO. American Airlines treat passengers like trash. I will not fly American Airlines again.  The Aircraft got delayed, at 1AM departure time, by 30 minutes apparently because it changed to a different runway. At 1AM! Is the Airport busier at 1Am than during the daytime? Because of this 30min delay, we are waiting 7 hours for the next flight home. We are even lucky to have this flight. Another lady has no flight today, and tomorrow she has only one flight where she can do standby. What a terrible airline. "
578,"  Los Angeles to Buffalo via Chicago. I will never buy another American Airlines ticket. If there is only AA available for my schedule, then I will change my schedule to find another airline. If the price of ticket of another airline is $200 more each way, I will gladly pay extra to avoid American Airlines. This trip, I and my wife are spending the whole day in the airport because the pilot wanted to use another runway to take off from LAX. That delayed the arrival by 30 minutes which made us miss the connecting flight by 10 minutes. The next flight was full, so they put us on standby and there is only one seat available. SO we need to wait another 3 hours. The flight attendants treat the passengers like trash. Thy yell at you. My dog will be staying the whole day alone -- we were supposed to take care of her in the morning. We can not find another dog sitter until we get home ourselves. So, folks, if you purchase American Airline ticket, factor in another full day from point-A to point-B in your itinerary because American Airlines will have delay or cancellation or something, always."
579,"  Thank goodness for a short flight from Nashville to Chicago. We were initially sat next to each other, but then on check-in at the gate, the agent asked if we would volunteer to take the next flight an hour later, for $$$ compensation. We agreed, but then on boarding, they announced that they did not need volunteers after all. However, they separated us in different rows, and I was given a middle seat in the last row near the toilets. Thanks for nothing American Airlines, and their attitude was tough luck. There is surely a lesson here. Never volunteer for anything from an airline that charges you for everything. Also, the economy seats on the B737-800 have to be some of the most uncomfortable in the airline industry."
580," I'm writing this scathing review after 3 back and forth emails with AA's customer disservice team. When your flight matters, when you have a vacation on the line or a critical meeting, and something goes wrong - don't expect AA to lift a finger to make it right. The policy they have shared with me is ""If we make an exception for you, we have to make an exception for everyone"" - Well that's the point! You should be making things right for every passenger you screwed over on this flight. My flight was AA515 Cancun to Phoenix, final destination Orange County CA. That's ONE connecting flight. Our flight was turned around mid-flight - the captain came on and explained we had mechanical issues. This is terrifying to hear. There was no mention of ""this is a minor issue and we are not going to crash and die"". People were panicking, praying, crying with stress and panic. We were told we would not receive an alternate flight that day and we would be sent to a hotel and be given dinner and breakfast. Bottom line, the transportation from/to the airport, the hotel, and the food was all unacceptable. We were herded around like cattle with no explanation of what was going on. When we were bussed back to the airport we encountered AA employees who had no idea what our situation was, and when we explained things they didn't care at all. ""Next!"" So instead of getting another flight set up to handle a full flight of people whose flight was cancelled, they just tried to put everyone wherever they could to fly out of Cancun. We ended up forced into a flight plan that didn't even get us home until the next day! After already missing a day of work over this, and begging our dog sitter to stay another day, we HAD to get home Friday. Their suggested route was Miami/Orlando/Phoenix/Orange County (Saturday). At the ticket counter in Miami, we spoke with the dumbest customer service employee I've ever spoken to, who spoke to himself instead of speaking to us, and he couldn't produce any flight solution that got us within 50 miles of home (that's 4 airports) on Friday. After we worked on our phones for a few minutes we found a flight that he missed and were able to convince him to get us on it. That's literally the rebooking agent's job - and he couldn't do it. Fast forward to Phoenix customer service desk and we realized the whole trip we hadn't sat next to each other - we went to the clerk and asked her if she could help us, after the day we have had, and waive a seat change fee (~$12). NO, she said plainly. This small gesture of courtesy was not even considered. This would have gone a long way in simply showing they care. But they 100% do not care about any of us. When we finally arrive in OC, surprise, or baggage was lost. Speaking to customer support we were told AA was not responsible for any of our $200+ in incidental unexpected charges (receipts provided) for the extra day of travel. They still wouldn't budge on the seat change fees, and now a random unexplained $12.87 charge is on my card that they won't address. They force you into an email only conversations - they claim their structure prevents the need for a supervisor to be involved. That their email team is the highest escalation possible. Speaking to someone in person is not allowed. You will take what they give you and you will like it! Genuinely disgusted by their service and handling of a tough situation that they could have easily rectified."
581,"  Savannah to Frankfurt via Charlotte. It has been a week and I am still missing my luggage! Luggage agents stating that there is no communication between the baggage claims at the airports? Switched luggage tags, not booked through destination - too much to all write down! However, sorry to say, incapable personnel, no real communication with the customer. Return calls are under a private number, emails are from unmonitored mailboxes. Sorry AA you need to do better. I am outraged! "
582,"  Las Vegas to Lafayette. Terrible customer service. Rude, cold agent who refuse to help after flight was cancelled. Sat around the Dallas airport waiting for twelve hours. Had to pay $400 for a hotel. They don't care about anyone. Cold and rude agents that just act like they are Superior to everyone."
583,"  Austin to London via Dallas Ft Worth. I have been a very long American Airlines (AA) flyer (since 1993), an American AAdvantage member since 2001, and an AAdvantage credit card holder since 2011. I just went through the worst flying experience I’ve ever had and as a result I’m going to try as hard as I can to avoid AA in the future. This all started with a canceled flight (AA1373) due to weather that actually didn’t impact the flight path at the time. I understand safety concerns, but canceling a flight that’s part of a larger booking literally hours before without a better solution than moving to next day is just not acceptable, and having some of the most incompetent customer support didn’t help our overall situation either. It was a flight from Austin to Dallas as part of another booking to Europe. The reason I know the weather didn’t impact the flight is because I wound up getting a rental car last minute instead and drove the 3 hours to Dallas to make the connecting flight. The communication of the canceled flight was literally hours before the takeoff. My wife and I were lucky enough to find a rental car in time, and after 2-3 hours on the phone making sure we could fly from Dallas (our connecting airport), AA decided to cancel and rebook the flight for the next day mid-drive! Thankfully we were able to get the issue resolved during our drive and at the airport. So, $140 later for the rental car, around 3-4 hours on the phone, and a 3 hour drive later, we made our connecting flight (operated by British Airways). We thought we were done with the horror of this, but on the return flight AA incompetence struck again. We had to wait at the customer assistance desk for BA (who were very helpful) while their ticketing support was on the line with AA for over 45 minutes. AA noted that I had already flown the flight we were at the airport checking-in to. Apparently I am now a time-traveler. We were at the airport over two hours before our flight. However, we didn’t get checked in until 15 minutes before boarding at LHR which is one of the largest airports. We managed to drop off our luggage under 5 minutes before cut-off time, and we made barely made it to our gate despite going through security after our boarding already started. This was all due to our persistence and BA customer service help. The entire trip was stressful, hectic, and AA left us with a horrible taste for their service. We received no refunds for the cancelled flight, no upgrades for having to rent a car and drive instead of flying our initial leg of the journey, nothing for having to be on the phone literally for hours trying to make sure we can fly and fixing the rebooked cancellation, nothing for messing up our bookings while on the phone trying to fix their mistake, nothing for stressing and spending a lot of time at service desks at airports, nothing for running through airports instead of spending quality time and enjoying our trip, no apology, nothing at all. The only silver lining is that we actually made it to where we should eventually and with our luggage, but that was only due to our persistence and BA customer service and help. Since all the years of flying with AA I have seen service degrade while other airlines have only improved theirs. I feel really bad for countless other people who didn’t have the know-how and persistence that we did to fix AA’ mistakes. I hope this review at least shines some light on the incompetence, and hopefully helps others in to make a decision when flying."
584,"Not Verified |  Killeen to Dallas. Worse experience of my life and will never use them again customer service was no help at all they had me stranded in Dallas tx due to their flight delays and would not help me with a hotel. I had to sleep on the sidewalk due to them not helping me get a hotel. I'll never fly with them ever again, and no one on customer service would help me or give me any answer. I asked to speak to a supervisor multiple time which they refused. I paid over 400 for this plane ticket just for them to have me sleep on a side walk."
585,  San Francisco to Los Angeles. The worst airline ever. Our flight was delayed because they couldn’t find a flight attendant! Horrible. On top of that they were extremely rude! People were asking politely and they were so rude. All they were repeating was “We cannot find our flight attendant” like what? We were waiting hours without any information. People were shocked by the behaviour! 
586,"Not Verified |  Dallas to Chicago. Worst experience in my life. They have delayed both of my flights and canceled one of them. I had to rebook a flight with a stop even though when I bought my tickets I made sure that both of the tickets are nonstop. Since they cancelled one of my flights I had to rebook another one which I could have gotten for cheaper. I will never use American Airlines again, because you can’t be sure if you are going to get to your destination on time."
587,"  Indianapolis to Washington Reagan. Everything went wrong during our team travel to the 2019 NCAA Rowing championships. Half of the group did not have tickets upon checking in, and we were held at check in until 20 minutes before boarding. The group of 30 had to run through TSA, and barely made it to the gate in time. However 3 individuals, the head coach, athletic director and an athlete were not allowed to board the plane, and were left standing at the gate while we sat for 10 minutes. We were told nothing could be done, and that it was the American Airlines way. The next flight to LGA was overbooked by over 10 seats. Overall the customer service has been horrible, with no consideration of keeping a group of 30 student athletes together or even having tickets to board the next flight."
588," Wichita to Knoxville with American Airlines. This airline is terrible! Flight delayed at midnight due to something with crew. Of course would never make connection. Wife called and was told nothing they could do. I called back irate and finally the got me on a flight. Upon arriving to Dallas they changed gates 3 times! Was supposed to take off now and they say they need to do maintenance will know more later. No one seems to care, just deal with it. Never flying American again! Flight 5848."
589,"Not Verified |  Chicago to Los Angeles. I know that inconveniences happen and I try to be patient. However, the lack of service or genuine care from American Airlines is ridiculous. After being delayed from my first flight (due to a mechanical issue) I arrived in Chicago to try to book a flight to LAX. I discovered that they never have enough people to assist passengers in rebooking (the one lady was too busy talking and laughing with a friend), American Airlines had cancelled yet another flight so all their flights to LAX were full and standby was packed, and when I told the customer service agent my issue she rolled her eyes and repeated what she had just said in a demeaning tone as if I was a child. The icing on the cake was when I asked where to go to receive a travel voucher for the two delayed/cancelled flights and the inconvenience of having to arrive at my destination 12 hours later...they looked at me as if I was crazy. I calmly explained that other airlines at least try to compensate you for the inconvenience. Instead they gave me a number to call (wrong number) and that lady said I would have to request compensation through their website after my trip. Of course the likelihood of receiving anything from the incompetent airline post travel will be next to nothing! And now that I think about it I want to avoid them at all costs in the future! Save yourself the headache and fly Southwest! At least they are kind and compensate you for inconveniences! With Southwest anytime a flight is delayed they pass out travel vouchers like candy, they care about their passengers unlike American Airlines!"
590," This travel day started fine, but our flight was delayed over 10 times. It resulted in over 24 hours of delayed time. The flight attendants were rude and quoted over the speaker that they had worked a long day too so please don’t be upset. We tried multiple times to refly into Dallas, and eventually ended in Austin. Once there, we were given no guidance to our flight, and the lady at the front desk was stressed and complained to us that they didn’t know what was going on either. Overall, American Airlines has been extremely unprofessional and unreliable, and I will never willingly choose this airline again."
591,  Salt Lake City to Nashville via Dallas. Got up at 0330 to make our 0600 flight. Our first flight was delayed over two hours because some of the flight attendants stayed overnight at a hotel that lost power (um ok). We missed our connecting flight due to this delay. The connection we ended up getting on was cancelled (right after we boarded in the last group) due to some mechanical issue. We somehow managed to get onto a third aircraft that actually got us to our destination. Do you think our checked luggage made it? Nope. Still waiting to have our bags delivered. Fun day all around.
592,"  Lihui to Los Angeles. The title pretty much says it all. My husband and I went on a honeymoon to Hawaii. Of course, we were so excited but on the way there, our first flight was delayed, and we missed our connecting flight by less than 5 minutes. As in the plane was still there but they couldn’t let us on. Can they not hold the plane for 5 minutes to let their passengers make their connections? Very frustrating. Then we were told that we couldn’t possibly get to Hawaii for 2 additional days. Luckily, one customer service agent pitied us and managed to get us there late that night (the only nice thing I will have to say about American). Fast forward to the return trip. The same thing happened. In fact, we arrived to LAX with plenty of time to make our connecting flight. However, we were stuck in the plane on the tarmac for an additional 30 minutes and then finally arrived at the gate to find that they had just closed the doors to our connecting flight. So here we are, stuck in LAX all day, and I’m sure it will end with us being screwed yet again by them. Pick another airline, especially if it’s a special trip. Because they will ruin it."
593,"  I travelled from Memphis Airport on May 03, 2019. American Airlines prepone my flight from Memphis to Chicago. I missed my flight but staff cooperation was very poor for alloting me new flight tickets. I have noticed that there was no coordination between American Airlines and Qatar Airways with whom I was travelling from Chicago to Delhi. I will never recommend to travel with American Airlines."
594,"  Philadelphia to Cancun. Horrible experience. The airline had serviced the plane prior to boarding, then had everyone wait on the plane 2 hours before taking off. No food beverage or ability to get up and stretch was offered. With the competitive prices and horrible planning/service I would not recommend this airline to anyone."
595,"  . I was originally supposed to fly from the BWI to STX with connecting flights in between. I showed up at the airport super early because I’m a very punctual person. They cancelled my first flight with no explanation whatsoever and my only option was to find someone to drive me 50 minutes from Baltimore MD to Virginia (DCA airport) to catch a flight from there to MIA (Miami) and from Miami to St. Croix Arriving STX, they didn’t have my bag. The American airline people said it was still in DCA but will arrive the next day. At 3:51pm they called it had arrived. I don’t have a car here and had to wait for a ride. We get there at 6, they people left. Nobody to open the door for me to get my bags and they won’t even answer the phone. What stopped these people when they called to say “your bags are here but we leave at this time”. Now I have to wait till next day again. I literally have nothing to wear. I had a backpack with me with there’s nothing in there to wear outside the house.  I cant even go out. I’m basically stuck inside the house. I paid for my ticket way ahead of time and I paid for my bags. I shouldn’t have to drive an additional 50 minutes to a different airport. I shouldn’t have to wait days for my bags. The last time I fly American is when I return to the states."
596,"  Palm Springs to Austin via Phoenix. Every time I fly with any version of this airline there is always a major issue. Sitting on the tarmac for hours and told we have to pay for food and that it’s only free after sitting on the plane for 2 hours. People needed food. It was a 6 hour flight. Right now I’m at the airport and a bunch of us missed our connecting flight by 3 minutes because their first flight was delayed by almost 2 hours. In addition, they wouldn’t take us to the next flight at the other end of the airport. Yet, others were cruising around on the carts in the airport from the same airline. Why? To get them to their flights. I asked. So, when we got to the gate we were told “sorry” and proceeded to watch the plane sit there for another 15 minutes while they booked everyone on another flight. I’m just praying that this next flight which is 4 hours later is on time and not as filthy as the last one. First Class with them is a joke. Greedy, filthy, and lots of untruths."
597,"  London to Los Angeles. Unless you overpay for your flight, they assign you the worst seat available such as a middle seat between two vacant aisle & window seats. If you ask for a better seat, they want $55. IFE was out on my May 8th trip and twice before on other flights. At LAX they park their a/c at Terminal 4 and then expect you to walk a mile through a tunnel to the International terminal for customs inspection. In my judgment, if they are going to land at terminal 4 they'd better hire immigration officials to process their planefuls of passengers. Staff are hostile and discourteous. My last three flights on a 777 were less than 1/2-full. They will realise when it's too late that if you do not treat the traveling public with courtesy and respect they will no longer have a public to serve."
598,"  Tampa to Santiago via Miami. I had been a loyal AA client for decades but rethinking my plans now. Booked a trip of a lifetime to Chile, business class all the way so we wouldn't arrive ""broken"" for our hiking adventure. The shortest flight (tampa to miami) was delayed 3X the actual length of the flight. Promised a cart to take us to gate in Miami, even though we were already doomed for connection. Wheelchairs showed up! We could run faster. Missed connection and with standby, stuck in middle seats in economy bulkhead for next flight. Luggage lost for 3 days, including hiking clothes. In spite of this, accidents happen, .but was shocked at refund for change in class of service! I cannot get an AA human being to explain rationale for paltry refund. Would prefer future upgrades on a flight but no one will discuss with us - not in customer service, not in support line, not through credit card! frustration level is through the roof. friends flew on same days, bought tickets at same time, flew economy down/business back and spent $3000 less! We got 10% of that back. a planned do-loop to make sure i go away without any answers. so much for spending the big bucks on a great flight. promised calls back and received 0. will look at other airlines in the future that treat customers right."
599,"  I just experienced a recent American ""Trip from Hades"" leaving the Rapid City Airport (RAP) to fly back to RDU via ORD. We were scheduled to leave on Monday 05/27 after 11:00 AM - the flight got delayed so many times I quit counting. We did get on the plane in the afternoon and sat on the tarmac for 2 hours (the 1st hour was spent without air conditioning or water) only to have to return to the gate (the excuse was related to weather but we are thinking it had something to do with the flight crew exceeding their time limits). The flight finally got canceled after we spent the entire day at RAP. The funny thing was there was no communication from the American gate during this time while the other airlines were constantly keeping their customers up-to-date via the airport's intercom (this is a regional airport so you could hear all the gate communications). We ended up spending the night at the airport since the flight was rescheduled for early the next morning (no vouchers for hotels offered of course!). When we called American customer service early the next day, there was no confirmation that Flight 3098 was scheduled to leave at 7:00 AM on 05/28 so we decided to get rebooked thru DFW. This was working great until the agent at the gate announced that American was offering $600 vouchers for people to take a later flight (they overbooked the DFW flight, of course!). We got a call on the intercom to come to the gate. The gate attendant basically moved us back to the ORD flight without our agreement (we had assigned seats BTW), lied about the weather at ORD and refused to honor the $600 voucher. After 32 hours, we finally made it back to North Carolina. Lessons learned: 1) Avoid flying American at all costs. 2) Stick to major airports so you have options. 3) Avoid holiday travel on airlines. 4) Consider driving an RV to see all the US parks."
600,"Not Verified |  Washington to Dallas Ft Worth. We originally selected Main Cabin Extra seats, as our flights weren't long flights. After our first flight, IAD to DFW, we realized that the extra money we paid for those seats was ridiculous. They were just as tight and uncomfortable as coach/economy. We tried to upgrade to business class only to be told that it would be an additional $645.00 each for a 2:45 minute flight. Even after paying a great amount extra for main cabin extra seats, all you're entitled to is a drink and tiny bag of pretzels. There is no seat back monitor/tv and it made for a boring/uncomfortable flight. Also the attendants were not very friendly and although I go out of my way to be be a polite/friendly person, it seemed to make no difference. "
601,"  Lexington to St Thomas via Atlanta. Stranded in STT airport for 48 hours by American Airlines due to hydraulic leak, and passengers left to their own devices to find a way home. Detailed version: AA flight 1195 on 5/22/19 had a mechanical problem we were told should take an hour to fix. After a couple of hours, we were told to board the plane. The pilot said there was a hydraulic leak, and a patch had been made. I could see the copilot standing in front of the wing watching as the pilot tested out the patch while we were all seated on the plane. Suddenly, the copilot made a frantic gesture moving his hands across his throat (""cut it"" signal) to tell the pilot to stop testing. The pilot said the patch had blown, and hydraulic fluid was all over the ground. It seems unsafe that passengers were on board the plane while this hydraulic patch was being tested. The AA staff held us at the airport until 9pm when they finally started distributing vouchers to a musty, dirty hotel. We finished eating our voucher dinner at 11pm. Before leaving the airport, AA staff told us to come back for an 8am flight the next day, 5/23. At dinner we were told our flight had been delayed until 2pm on 5/23. Before we checked out of the hotel, we found out the flight was delayed again until 6pm. I immediately called the AA booking hotline to get another flight. I spoke over an hour with a manager who said there were no seats on any flights from STT that day, even on other airlines. So we were stuck waiting to see if our AA plane had actually been fixed. On 5/23, we sat in the airport all day, watching other AA passengers arrive on a different working plane and fly off to Charlotte, which was our destination. They would not allow us to board the working plane, though we had been waiting 24 hours. We were stranded since we were ""assigned to"" the broken plane. The gate agents told us they had no info about when the plane would be fixed. They were waiting for information ""from above"". Many people asked to speak with the AA manager for STT airport. The AA clerks radioed him over and over, but he stayed outside on the tarmac so that no one could speak to him. Some people had run out of medication, and others with special diets like myself (Celiac disease) were feeling faint from a lack of gluten free food. At 7pm they began handing out hotel vouchers again, and released us from the airport with no information about when our flight was rescheduled. We spent another night in the hotel. We called the AA booking phone number for 3 hours talking to various agents, who said they could not transfer us to a Delta flight that showed seats available online since it was overbooked. Finally, we were passed to a manager who said he found two ""reserved operations"" seats on an AA flight to Philadelphia used for situations like this. I asked why I wasn't offered these seats earlier that morning when I was on the phone with a booking manager since it could have saved me 24 hours of delay! We went to the airport for a 3rd day in a row on 5/24. We finally made it home at midnight on 5/24/19, which is 48 hours after our original scheduled arrival time. Due to the 48 hour delay, our pets were held at the kennel 2 days past when we were supposed to pick them up. We incurred extra fees for the kennel, as well as airport parking, and my husband wasted 2 extra ""vacation"" days spent all day in an airport. I will never fly with AA again."
602,"  My husband and I departed from Cincinnati for our honeymoon in Cancun, Mexico and we had a connection in Charlotte. Every flight was delayed - without notice, as per usual. We arrived at CVG before 7AM for our 9:30AM flight... only to be moved from one gate, to the next, back to the original, and THEN find out the flight is going to be delayed for minimum 40 minutes because they oversold it & no one was budging. Next, we arrive in Charlotte, and another delay. Once we finally arrive in Mexico, we are scouring baggage claim for our luggage, only to find out it did not leave Cincinnati. It took them over 12 hours to get the bags to us and they gave us no update about the progress. Each time we called the 1-800 number for an update, we were placed on hold for over an hour, and then were told basically ""the bags will get there when they get there."" Needless to say, we ended up spending basically our entire honeymoon budget on clothing just so we could enjoy our first day.  Finally, around midnight, the bags show up. Unfortunately, my bag was soaked. Thank goodness our resort credits covered laundry services. The flight out of Cancun was delayed, with no notice. Then, on board the flight someone had a medical emergency - nurses & a doctor on board the plane recommended landing for patient treatment & the pilots kept on.  Finally, we make it to Charlotte, and are delayed. There is no update to when we would possibly take off, there never is. After waiting over 2 hours, and too many gate changes to count, we finally took off. I have already cancelled the credit card we earned points with. Flyer beware, if you want to have a miserable time, by all means book with American Airlines. If you want to actually enjoy your trip, choose any other airline."
603,"Not Verified |  I started off Kansas City to Stuttgart via Chicago O‘hare and London Heathrow. The plane from Chicago was delayed due to Maintenance work on The plane and i Missed my flight To Stuttgart after Plane landed in London. American Airlines issued me a Ticket from London to Frankfurt than Frankfurt to Stuttgart, I have been awake for over 27 Hours Running from Terminal to Terminal. Never American Airlines again!"
604,"  American Airline standard? I've bought first class ticket to flight with American airline from Fort Walton Beach (FL) to Santa Ana (CA) at May 18th, 2019 for me and my wife. American airline downgrade us to economy grad without any warning, nor explanation. When I made complain to American airline Customer service, that don't answer after 3 work days, until Skytrax pubished my case. But when American airline response me, they wrote me that, their downgrades are automated by their system and happen for a number of different reasons. And Customer Relations of American Airlines wrote: ""Unfortunately, there is not a specific reason I can provide to you regarding your downgrade"". There is no any explanation, nor apologize. Is it the American airline standard? I have a right to know, why American downgrade us. And American airline must apologize to us for their downgrading. In the other side, American airline must also pay back money when they didn't serve us as first class, as they provided us ticket."
605,"  Chicago to Columbus. It is not the first time I travel this airline and it always has delays, I do not recommend it. This time it was a delay of 7 hours, not even credit for food, they only offer you junk food, during the 7 hours of waiting I changed the gate more than 5 times. On other trips I have lost my suitcase twice. Really lousy service. No es la primera vez que viajo por esta linea y siempre tiene retrasos, no la recomiendo, esta vez fue un retraso de 7 horas, ni siquiera crédito dan para comida, solo te ofrecen comida chatarra, durante las 7 horas de espera me cambiaron el gate mas de 5 veces. En otros viajes me han perdido la maleta dos veces. Realmente pésimo servicio."
606,"Not Verified |  Be advised if you have never booked code share, do not ever do it. We booked on AA (million mile + traveler) code share with Iberia. Miserable experience on the behalf of Iberia, which makes it an AA problem. There is no accountability between the airlines. We booked business class tickets and Iberia changed our flight from to go via Delta through Atlanta with no notice and no reason. We got bumped for Iberia frequent fliers not AA status fliers. Return trip, same! Iberia put us on standby for business class from MAD to ORD. We paid for these tix last January! Iberia has no accountability to American and American can enforce nothing with Iberia. Code share = broker. Book your flights direct. I will be moving to Delta and or United, whomever will match my status."
607,"  The trip out to my destination was an absolute nightmare. My first flight (which I was up at 6 for) was cancelled on short term notice. The flight I booked after that was delayed by 2 hours. Wound up sitting on the plane at the terminal when it landed for another 2 hours because none of the terminals were open. My layover flight was continuously delayed in 30 minute increments (at 1 am mind you). The plane was even there and ready for boarding. Flight was finally cancelled. The staff there wouldn't even keep us notified on why it was delayed or the progress on leaving. There was another 2 hour wait in line to rebook. This was on a Saturday and they said there were no seats available until Monday or Tuesday. I went to check for myself and there were a couple of flights for the following day. Overall, this airline was completely unprofessional and seemed to care little for their customers. I won't be booking with them again if I can help it. I'd give them a zero rating if I could."
608,"  I traveled with American Airline from Fort Walton Beach (FL) to Santa Ana (CA). I’ve bought for me and my wife first class ticket for flight AA 1538 from Fort Walton Beach airport (FL) to Dallas FT Worth (TX), and AA 1524 from Dallas FT Worth (TX) to Santa Ana (CA). When I’ve checked in at Fort Walton Beach airport, the staff arranged me and my wife to economy seats on the flight 1538 without any explanation, neither warning. Weve expected it only when we’ve got in flight. I’ve ask 2 stewardess, why I’ve bought first class, but now I have to sit in economy class. They were vexed, and indicated me to talk to a man, who seemed be a chief of crew. When I told to that man, the man said, that he doesn’t know it, that I can complain to American Airline. That time was very close to flight time, so I had to flight with economy class. I think, what happen with me and my wife on flight AA 1538, shows, that American airline disregards customers. Or American Airline discriminates me and my wife, the foreigners, even we pay for first class ticket. In the other side, American Airline staff are not well educated, neither in customer service, nor in attitude. I think American Airline deserves 1 point in your scoring"
609,"Not Verified |  Tried to do an online check in for myself and my travel companion and my locator was not available and hers was, but we were unable to complete the check in just kept indicating an error. Called reservations and they were able to get my reservation reactivated, but my travel companion they said the only thing we could do was to check in at the gate. Every time I have had to fly American there is always issues with them for reservations and most of the gate agents and flight attendants have a less than helpful attitude. I have never had these issues with Southwest or Delta. I try to avoid American Airlines when possible, they make the travel experience unpleasant and frustrating."
610,"  I had a reservation to fly into Yuma from Charlotte with a layover in Phoenix. I arrived on time to [email protected] 9:30. Once we arrived there was a plain stationed in our bay so we were told it would be a delay. The American Airline passengers did not bother to contact the connecting flight to Yuma and tell them we were in phoenix. So once we got off of the flight and were going to B5 to catch the connecting flight it was closed and we were advised to go to customer service. Once we got to customer service the line was so long, it took an hour to get to the counter only to be told that the customer service closed at 11:00 and we needed to go to another customer service Kiosk on the other side of the airport. by this time, I was tired, had been up since 5:00 in the morning east coast time. I called customer service and was asked if I wanted to be reimbursed. I explained to the agent that this wasn't a pleasure trip, I had flown here for a funeral. she then said, well I can send you back to Charlotte and give you a full refund. I just hung up. Once it was my turn in the customer service line. I was told that i had to spend the night at the airport and the next flight was full so I would have to take the next flight at 10:52. I then became loud and explained to her that thus was of no fault of mine and I should not have to be inconvenienced because of a mistake made by the airline. She then offered me a night at the double tree hotel and a food voucher for a 12.00 meal. Needless to say, I am very disappointed in the customer service received on this trip and not only that the huge inconvenience it caused. I plan to contact US airways next week and if they are not willing to offer me a refund. I will never use them again. There is no such thing as customer service anymore."
611,"  Dallas to Seoul. The first leg of this trip back to the States was good. The last leg returning to Seoul was horrible. The gate attendant was rude. The seat space was made for a shorter person. I asked to be moved to a different seat prior to the flight and the gate attendant was less than professional. He was more concerned about the revenue of the seat rather than my comfort. Furthermore, my seat was already a preferred seat. It would have been a one for one swap. This airline should treat military members better. "
612,"  Chicago to Miami. When American Airlines says “tickets assigned at check-in” it means “members of the same family unit buying in a single transaction will be randomly assigned seats in plane without regard to being a family unit in order to generate artificial demand at the airport for purchasing seats.” But that they do not disclose when selling you the ticket. Not even in the fine print. In addition, their systems are unable to deal with Latino hyphenated last names and you will not be able to do online check in with one of those but will have to do it at the airport if using your passport as you will be told there is no identity match (there is no culturally competent IT provider to prevent them to get rid of hyphenation) so again you must end at the gate to solve it. As for the rest, same mediocrity as always."
613,"Not Verified |  I will never fly AA again. Staff at Abilene unfairly confiscated my roll-aboard, which I have ramp-checked with them 5 times in the past 30 days. This time, they insisted I check it and charged me $30. Now I'm stuck transiting DFW with a heavy carry-on and no wheels. I am rebooking my next flights on Southwest into Dallas Love and I'll drive 2.5 hours to Abilene and back rather than ever set foot on another American flight again."
614,"  Chicago to Punta Cana. I just want to say that American Airlines on two separate occasions has earned back my loyalty. The first time was on a trip from Chicago to the Dominican Republic. My husband had his wallet in a backpack stowed under the seat in front of him. During the trip, it must have popped out. We exited the plane, made it through customs with his passport that was in his pocket and only realized upon exiting the airport and meeting our driver that his wallet was missing. We had no idea if it was stolen, lost, where it was, etc. The driver immediately encouraged us to go back to the American Airlines office in the airport which was quite a feat given the language barrier. By the time my husband got upstairs to AA, his wallet had already been turned in and was waiting for him there with nothing missing. You can imagine the heart-pounding anxiety of losing your wallet, which basically contains your life, in a foreign country. A real vacation killer. So thank you for whoever was involved in returning the wallet. You have no idea how grateful I am. Second, my daughter, a med student in the Chicago area, recently flew to Cameroon, Africa on a trip to bring medical supplies to a surgeon and work with him in the small towns and villages. As part of the trip, she was bringing a large duffle bag filled with prescription meds, surgical gear, etc. at her own expense. The baggage person at American at O'Hare grew very quiet and had to enter every item in the bag onto a form. She was very concerned about not being allowed to bring the items, as this was a requirement of the trip. She was amazed and surprised when the $360 baggage fee was waived by American Airlines because they had a heart and recognized the humanitarian mission in the trip."
615,"Not Verified |  Newark to Ontario via Phoenix. Never flying this airline again, not only did it take a ridiculous amount of time to get in the air due to unorganized staff, half the people on my flight missed their connection flights. I almost missed mine due to a last second gate change, ran across the airport thinking I had 5 minutes to get on my plane like the first attendant told me, then get to the new gate to be told we’ll be having another hour wait because they are having a maintenance problem. Horrible!"
616,  Chicago to Orlando. Thought I’d write a good review. American Airlines I believe is the best at CS and accommodating there passengers. It’s a very challenging business to keep everyone happy. More people should stop and think before they write bad reviews? It still beats driving! Give them a break.
617,  San Francisco to Charlotte via To Orlando. Plane was delayed due to “uncontrollable circumstances” so we missed our next flight and it couldn’t be rescheduled til the next day 7 hours later. They gave us a new flight “for free” and a “discount coupon” to a hotel for 120$ per night plus we had to pay 25$ taxi fares each trip. About 50+ people or more seemed to have the same problem. They told us and everyone else it wasn’t their fault and that there would be no compensation for our lost time or our troubles nor would they pay for a hotel for us. What terrible customer service. 
618,"  I bought 2 tickets 02/02/19 for non stop flight from New York to Las Vegas at 05/04/19 and back 05/09/19. Approx 2 weeks prior depature, I got a notice my flights canceled by email. As a result, I and my wife had 1 stop flights in both directions. It was my Birthday, and I was very upset. Never use American Airlines!"
619,  Flight 2616 from Oklahoma City to Dallas late on 5/17/19 - can't make connecting flight and no additional connectors available that day. Either rebook for next day or stay the night at DFW at our expense as per AA customer representative. So we rebook for same flight 5/18/19. Flight is subsequently cancelled the eve of flight. At this point I've given up on AA to get a plane in the air. Paid significant money to get a one way flight on Southwest Airlines and made it home only a day late. I would still be in OKC or DFW as of 5/20/19 if I stuck with AA as their 5/19/19 rebook was also too late to make connecting flight. Very poor service - at least between OKC & DFW. Can't recommend AA for getting to and from OKC.
620,"  Birmingham to Lubbock via Dallas. I had a flight at 5:40 AM, I was contacted the night before and told my flight had been cancelled. I did not receive a explanation as to why. Weather was beautiful all day! They rescheduled it for 5:40PM, the flight was then delayed because American airlines did not have enough ground men to bring the arriving plane in. The plane sat there well over 45 minutes until finally assisted. Not to mention those passengers had to sit on that plane with no AC. So when we get on the AC is still out so we have to bring a mechanic and it delays it by another 20-30 minutes. I miss my connecting flight and try standing in line to reschedule another flight, we stood there around 30 minutes before anyone ever assisted us. Finally someone assisted the lady in front of me, when it was my turn he walked away. I asked where he was going, which I had about 10 people behind me, and he said I gotta go! No explanation, so I waited about another 30 minutes before I was finally helped, and when I was helped they acted like I was the one causing the problems. It’s just all around an awful experience! Wouldn’t recommend it for anyone! Customer service is the worst of any airline i’ve ever been on!"
621,"  Barcelona to Washington via Miami. I will avoid flying American Airlines. May 19th, my wife and I arrived at the Miami from Barcelona, Spain in route to our final destination of Washington,DC. In Barcelona, we were asked to check our Carry On baggage due to the expectation that the overhead storage was already full. Upon arrival in Miami, our connecting flight to Washington was delayed from 3:53 pm to 5:20 due to issues with the two bathrooms on the plane. The pilot gave everyone the opportunity to step off the plane until the problem was resolved my maintenance. One of the AA gate attendance began arguing with customers for leaving the plane even though we explained to him that this was something approved by the captain. We arrived in Washington, DC to be told that our carry on bags did not arrive with our plane. Even after over an hour delay, the bags didn’t get placed on the plane. This is unacceptable. On May 20th we were contacted by American Airlines that so far they only have 1 of the missing bags in Washington, DC even though the bag tracker shows they both did in fact arrive in DC. We were also told that it would be as late as 4pm today (the next day) that we would receive the 1 bag. I am currently on hold right now with American Airlines after waiting over an hour to speak with a representative to find out the status of my 2nd bag. This is by far one of the worse flight experiences for my wife and I. I will add that much of this is also due to the overall poor customer service given throughout the entire Miami, FL airport. But, unfortunately American Airlines is a Primary flight provider there. I will go with other options going forward. This is a poorly run organization and it continued all the way to Washington, DC"
622,"  Nashville to Charlotte. Only fly American if you don’t mind not making it to your final destination on time. I had a flight out it STL that was cancelled, they couldn’t get me on another plan until a day later very late at night. I stood in line to talk with the attendants for over an hour only to be talked two for 2 minutes and basically forced out of line after being told “I was lucky I even got the (rebooked) flight I did get.” The attendant was beyond rude for someone who is just trying to reach their destination after their flight being cancelled due to an unknown delay."
623,"  I purchased an upgraded, more expensive round trip ticket from American Airlines to Yuma, from Phoenix AZ. When I arrived at Phoenix/Mesa I was shocked to find myself at the wrong airport. My flight to Yuma would be leaving from Sky Harbor, 35 min away. Luckily, with the help of an amazing security guard at Mesa, who helped me find the app and get a Lyft ride, I made my connection. However, my return flight schedules would not allow for that 35 min ride between flights. So I went to the desk at Sky Harbor and asked for help. They told me, no problem, I should be able to fly standby on the 6:30 am flight in Yuma so I could make my connection. They said it would cost an extra $75. Not so bad. Three days later I arrived before the Yuma AA agent and asked to fly standby on the 6:30 am flight. The agent and supervisor said, ""No"" I did not purchase an upgraded ticket and ""No"", I could not fly standby, I would have to purchase another ticket for $230. They were flat out unconcerned, bordering on rude, and unwilling to find a solution for me. I was absolutely stuck and had to purchase the ticket. The worst part of this is that everyone I spoke to from the security guards to desk agents, said of the airport confusion, ""This always happens,"" and from a relative of an American Airlines family member, ""American Airlines is in trouble for the terrible customer service."" It does seem that it's all about money. I will never fly American again, and it's unfortunate because they are the only airline in Yuma, I will never fly through Yuma airport either."
624,"❎ Not Verified | Toronto to Baton Rouge via Dallas. This airline is so poor. They have cancelled my flight at the last minute which has made me miss my meeting in Baton Rouge, and when I tried to call customer service, the wait was more than 3 hours. What kind of service is this? Definitely would not recommend this to anyone. Avoid this at all cost. Zero stars is all the deserve."
625," Gulfport to Orlando via Charlotte. The worst experience with this company, I have flown many time with American as well as with Delta and United but I have had the worst experience with American. Customer service reps don't care, they don't sympathize and it seems like they don't want to help. I asked a desk lady why my flight was delayed 3 times and she said that she just got to the job and she didn't know. My best bet was to go to AA.COM and find out. I did so but there is no info about why my flight is delayed. The time was 10:30 pm changed to 11:00, 11:30, now is at 2:30am. No apologies for no info just a yes it's delayed. The flight from Gulfport to Charlotte had wifi but you couldn't even watch a movie because it's very slow. Never again."
626,  Phoenix to Santa Rosa. Last time I flew my plane was delayed until 2 in the morning. I didn’t have high hopes for this flight and it has now been delayed twice (2 hours each.) I wouldn’t be surprised if I wait until boarding time and they cancel the flight. This is the worst airline ever! Don’t count on being reassured that you will depart on time or at all with this airline.
627," Nashville to Chicago. No customer service at the airport. AA employees are always frustrated and have no intention to help you. They toss you around 3 or 4 different queues. Different ones of kiosk, baggage, service. You have to go to all those queues in mysterious sequence. Staff wont really help neither there are any signs. Missed or delayed flights every single time I boarded American. Best of luck. I am never taking AA ever again."
628,  Montego Bay to Fort Wayne via Charlotte. I have flown with American airlines 4 times and this was the worst. Got notification that our flight from Jamaica to Charlotte was delayed by an hour. Once we got to the airport it was an hour and a half and we miss our connection in Charlotte by 5min. Couldn't just let me stay in Jamaica another day. Need to give more notice for this. I had to spend the night in Charlotte. Not happy at all. Couldn't hold that flight to Fort Wayne being it was their fault or book another one. I know they got enough planes. Had to wait until 1130 the next morning and of course it was over booked they said. But once on the plane there where open seats. I paid in advance for upgrade seating and of course with this flight my husband and i didn't even get to sit together. Don't think I will be flying with them any more.
629," Hong Kong to Portland via Dallas. American Airlines should be embarrassed with their International First Class product. I flew on their longest nonstop flight from Hong Kong to Dallas and the experience was mediocre at best. The few positives were a friendly cabin crew and the actual seat itself, which has a lot of room and adjustments. But these good points are overshadowed by miserable selection of food and drink. Upon boarding, we were brought cold, stale almonds and cheap champagne that cost maybe ten bucks a bottle. After takeoff, we were rushed thru our meal because of ""upcoming turbulence."" My beef filet was an inedible mass of gristle and the ice cream sundae was completely melted. The promised ""Open Snack Bar"" was nothing but a bag of chips and disgusting cold sandwiches. The breakfast served before landing was OK. The Purser on the flight actually apologized to the eight passengers in First Class for the sorry food and drink stating that ""There have been some unfortunate cutbacks."" The wifi did not work and the entertainment system was so slow that I gave up and just used the map. I will be cutting back my business with AA after this terrible experience."
630,  Miami to Los Angeles. My original flight from CUN to connect in MIA for LAX was delayed 3+ hours and I was offered several alternate options. Once I arrived in MIA there was confusion amongst the staff with some telling us we missed our flight when it was actually delayed. Not one person empathized with my situation. I was repeatedly told there is nothing I can do because of the ticket type purchased. I was given a boarding pass for the following morning at 9am but was never told it was a standby until I realized at boarding time I had no assigned seat. Well didn’t make that flight either and still no one empathetic. No offers for options of which there were plenty just the same flight 2nd flt on stand by AGAIN was delayed from 1230 to 2pm. And then no on board amenities ie. charging station
631," Denver to Dallas. Worst experience ever - arrived 55 min before the flight and since we needed seat assignments the agent at the kiosks directed us to get in line for the main ticket counter. There were a couple of people ahead of us and the agent came out from behind the desk and started asking everyone why they were in line. I told her the window was closing for us to check in, but she continued to go person by person to see why they were in line, rudely asking why they were in line and condescendingly telling them to use the kiosk or that she couldn’t help them, instead of just taking customers in the order they were in line. She completely ignored us and the fact that the minimum 45 minutes was ending. She went back behind the counter and after a bit called someone from the priority line (they had a dedicated rep handling their line) she was incredibly rude and intentionally delaying helping us. When we finally were called up, she very coldly told us we were too late and that we should have used the kiosk. We told her that we were told to get in the line- were actually escorted there and she said, well I will have a talk with that agent. She put us on another flight leaving 2 hours later but did not tell us that we were on standby. We found out when we trying to get seat assignments. No go. Talked to a supervisor - no help. Told this is what you get with economy tickets - ridiculous how we were treated. Never experienced this with Delta or United. Finally got on a flight and were told as we were walking on that there was no overhead bin space left and would have to check bags-even made a lady get off the plane to check hers - when we got on the plane there were tons of open bins- some completely empty! Unbelievable- and so rude and the flight attendant said that’s what you get with an economy ticket- which is not true - carry ons are included. Will never get my business again - rather pay triple to another airline that treats all of their passengers like human beings."
632,  New York to Washington. American Airlines used to be one of the better American (USA) companies. Now it is trash. They are absolutely incompetent. I was waiting for the screen to show the flight was boarding. Then a notice came up saying the flight was delayed 15 minutes. I happened to walk over to the counter anyways. If I had not I would have missed my flight! They never showed boarding. And the flight left on time. No explanation; only the typical American Airlines shoulder shrug.  You’re better off flying a budget airline in Europe than you are flying any American airline.
633,Not Verified |  Rochester to Orlando. Worst airline. We had multiple planes “break down” with mechanical issues which resulted in multiple delays. We watched as tons of people missed there connecting flights. The staff was incredibly rude and not helpful. We will never fly with American Airlines again.
634,"  Albuquerque to Redmond via Phoenix/Los Angeles with Skywest Airlines as American Eagle and Compass Airlines as American Eagle. The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced. Thank you SW and Alaskan airlines for  incredible and helpful customer service, I will always fly with you, never American Airlines again!"
635,  LaGuardia to Pittsburgh. The employees of this airline are so bitter and angry. Their customers are a nuisance to them. They can often be overheard complaining about the customers and/or their schedules. On May 15 there was a customer who was made to check a bag when there was clearly space for her to bring it on. The flight attendant in first class referred to this customer as a bitch to her fellow flight attendant. Unacceptable. 
636,"  Miami to Rio de Janeiro. If there’s an award for least child friendly airline, American Airlines wins by a landslide. Their website claims they have bassinets on long haul flights which are first come first serve at the gate. Correction; only if you want to pay an extra $120 for it or pay even more to upgrade your seats. When I asked if the bassinet was available, the answer was “oh, people are already sitting in those seats and they aren’t going to want to ask them to move”. Great customer service. I was then lied to at the gate and told the bassinet was already claimed, but when I looked on the kiosk at the gate, those seats were available for a paid upgrade. Really helpful for me on an overnight 8 hour flight with an 8 month old baby. The icing on the cake is that they don’t even have priority boarding for families with small children. Holding my crying infant, they told me I had to “wait for my boarding group”. By the time we got to our seats, the overhead compartment was full above us, where we needed to access bottles, formula, and toys. I can deal with my crying child because your agents clearly have no empathy for an exhausted mother and baby, but who really paid the price is the rest of your passengers who got to listen to it all night. Nice to know you care more about the money for the upgrade of the bassinet over every passenger in economy class. I didn’t choose  to fly your airline, I had to because of sick in-laws and getting to Rio in time. Emirates Airline offers 2  bassinets in every section of 777 economy class, 6 in total, for no extra cost. They will switch adults without kids seats to accommodate families with babies and have priority boarding. A little empathy goes a long way, because traveling with a baby is stressful enough already. All I received from your desk agents and staff was a quick “no” without any effort to try and help. If avoidable I’ll never choose your airline again."
637,"  Columbus to Phoenix . I understand delays. I especially want the airline to make sure the aircraft is safe. However, when I got to Phoenix they had already delayed the flight to Honolulu from 1130am to 2pm. They said it was maintenance. After sitting for hours they said the plane left Dallas but had to return there for some reason. So at this point they have moved departure time to 3.30pm. This is a special trip for me. I dont have the extra money for this kind of trip. I saved for months so I could fly out and see my son who is serving in the army. I havent seen him in over a year! At this point I have already lost 5 hours with him. I'm pretty sure there will be no compensation."
638,"Not Verified | San Francisco to Dallas. Yikes, 2091 bad reviews?! Well, here goes 2092. American Airlines is the single worst airline I have ever flown. I bought an itinerary to fly down to DFW from SFO on Friday to Sunday of this past weekend. I then had to be down there on Thursday night, I called American to see if they could help me switch my flight, they told me it would be cheaper to just buy another flight. So I bought the second flight (also through American mind you) on Thursday night. While this was frustrating, I understood that I bought an Economy ticket and they would not roll out the red carpet for me, so I am not mad about that. I took my Thursday night flight, actual flight itself wasn't terrible. $9 cocktails is a bit high but nothing too ridiculous. After I thoroughly enjoyed most of weekend in Dallas, I tried checking into my Sunday flight on Saturday night. It said the system was down and I would have to check-in in the morning, which happened to be the morning of my nephew and Godson's baptism. I tried checking in before the service, same issue. So I called American. They cancelled my itinerary. They cancelled my itinerary because I was a ""no-show on my initial flight to Dallas."" So I was stranded after I had flown to Dallas via American because American didn't know I was in Dallas - starting to see why I am so angry? Anyway, I was forced to miss the baptism party to make sure I could get back to SFO the same night and had to be on the phone with AA customer service. The AA customer service line had zero empathy for my situation and functionally told me to ""we cant help you."" So I decided to go to the airport and try to explain myself. I have never been treated like less of a human. It seems as if American has a training to make their customer service people as cold and heartless as physically possible to the economy passengers. I was forced to buy an additional $600 ticket to get home. Then, when my co-rider had the audacity to try to get on my flight as a standby passenger they told her that she would need to buy a new ticket as well. I would rather drive than ever fly American again. Terrible people working at a terrible, unethical company."
639," Denver to Phoenix. Considering all of these poor reviews, American very clearly does not care about their customers. My experience was awful. I missed a very important meeting because of a delay for who knows what reason and all I was met with was a condescending Supervisor. Save your money and fly a different airline. This one is truly terrible and will only look at you as money, not a person with very real life obligations and schedules. Their schedule is the only one that matters, not yours."
640,Not Verified |  Chicago to Tampa. Fly this airline at your own risk of financial loss. I was stranded in Chicago due to random flight cancellation due to the Boeing 737 max planes being grounded. I was not offered a return flight until the following day so I arranged a different airline to get home same day and American would not issue a refund. This is quite unbelievable and unacceptable. I would not fly this airline when you risk financial loss due to circumstances beyond your control
641," After boarding, a flight attendant went around with less than ten earphones for the entire plane. Then he told a few seated people that he ran out of headphones before getting on his phone. We were then told by the captain that he was waiting for permission to get cargo tape on a pipe, which he assured us would not heavily impact the safety of the flight. We waited nearly two hours before they got permission to put cargo tape on a pipe (which for some reason, they couldn't resolve before we boarded). After an additional half hour, the airplane pipe was taped and we finally took off. The attendants were on their phone for most of this time. So, no earphones for more than half the plane's passengers for any way to pass the time and take our minds off the fact that most of us were getting dangerously close to miss our connecting flights (we were in Costa Rica, traveling to Miami on our way to our final destination). When we landed, no one from AA helped those with connecting flights get through the lines quickly or showed any concern or support for their customer's schedules. After waiting in long, stressful lines where all my family and I could do was watch precious minutes slip away (and watch other fellow passengers of our flight stress in line after also being abandoned by AA), we ran to our flight and arrived 5 min before departure time only to be told that the plane had left (we could see it from the window) and that we should go to customer service. 10 min later, I watched the plane carrying our checked luggage (and our clothes and toiletries) take flight. At AA's customer service, we were subjected to a 4 hour wait despite the numerous reps behind the counter (only one was receiving customers). Finally, at midnight, we were told that the next available flight wasn't until the next evening. 3 out of 4 of us had to call out an extra day of work because of this. When we bought a travel package through an independent company and saw that they had booked us with AA, I had misgivings. After my experience with them, I am regretful that I didn't listen to my own misgivings, the news, and the hundreds of voices against AA."
642,Not Verified |  Phoenix to Las Vegas. The gate agents are horrible. They asked for volunteers to get on a later flight and I was the second one to volunteer and they chose the others before me. I already had delayed flights and cancelled flights and the gate agent was knew I had volunteered. Why not give the vouchers to those by order of who was there first instead of whether you like the person or not. I’ll never fly with them again.
643,"  
Phoenix to Salt Lake City. American Airlines sucks. They delayed our flight by four hours and since we were “group 9” we were forced to check our bags. They let so many people go on standby who used our compartment there wasn’t room for our bags. Only fly this airline if you want to feel like a second class citizen, like your money wasn’t good enough for them!"
644,  Memphis to Philadelphia. I was able to get on an earlier flight because I made it to the airport on time. Except they wouldn't let me switch because I wasn't economy. It's mother's day and now I'll miss the first mother's day with my wife after having our first child. Thanks American Airlines.
645,"  Phoenix to Sacramento. I do not recommend this airline. If you like unhappy and unhelpful crew,  then this is your airline. If not then please make your life easy and choose another. I felt sick on the flight and the crew member did not allow me to walk up to her to ask for water she just told me to wait. Anyway they are absolutely disrespectful and rude. Our next flight apparently my luggage was to big and she made a whole scene. How in the world?"
646,"Not Verified |  Our flight was scheduled to depart at 12:15 am. We didn’t board the plan until 12:45 am, but after being on the plane we were told the flight was canceled due to missing pilot. We were given papers with a number to call and told they could help us reschedule our flight and set up hotel commendations. I called the number and they moved my flight to 7am flying into Orlando, but they told me I would have to talk to someone at the gate desk to secure a hotel. I am now waiting in a line of 40 other passengers not happy about this service."
647,"  London to Los Angeles. First time flyer with American Airlines so was unsure what to expect. Aircraft was quite new so was spacious, clean and bright. Booked exit seats which was a really good decision. No one seated in front and as much leg room as required, more than in PE. Crew very professional, helpful and attentive. The only thing that prevents me giving 10/10 was the food which was average at best. Would have no hesitation in booking again."
648,  Boston to La Guardia. Worst airline. Bad customer service. La Guardia gate staff is the rudest of all the airports I’ve been too ( I travel weekly). Planes are always late. Plane has not once been on time to La Guardia. Delays to and from there constantly. Planes are old and need more time for maintenance. 
649,"  Worst around trip I have ever taken. Went from Tallahassee  to Newport News VA for my daughter’s graduation. First flight got delayed for maintenance issues, so they said. Lost my connection and since it was the last flight of the night had to flight the next day. We were given an voucher and taken to hotel( more like a motel) and also given food vouchers to use at the airport that by the way we could not use since it was late and all food places at the airport were close. In the return flight we asked about seat changes since AA wants to charge for that. If you have a reservation you would expect for the seats to be together. But not AA randomly pick your seats to force to pay for that option. Met three couples and every single of them had the same problem. But asked again and there was plenty of unassigned seats but they were not available unless you pay for them, to late give them to standby passengers. Lucky we found people that change seats with us. Not thanks to AA. Return flight was delayed again! Customer service and attendants were rude and not willing to help anyone. But if you show some character here you go out of the plane. AA is there because Is a service needed, not because the good service provided."
650,"  Boston to Washington. This is the worst airline ever. Our flight has been canceled all day (today is 5/12/19). A bunch of folks were supposed to board a 9 am flight, every flight has been canceled since this morning, including the 3pm flight we were supposed to board.  A waste of people's time and money."
651,"  Dallas to Lexington. Arrived at the airport 42 minutes before my flight with literally zero people in the security line, but AA refused to allow me to board because I had a checked-sized bag. Despite having plenty of time, the agent first lied to me about why she couldn’t check my bag and said my only option was to go without my bag. I said it was no problem if my bag came late I just needed to make Mother’s Day dinner and wanted to board. She would not check my back on a later flight and said AA won’t do that. I said I would go without my bag and my husband could pick up my bag from security. They said you can’t leave without your bag and threatened to call the police on me if I did so! So, I couldn’t fly with my bag, have my bag come on a later flight, OR have my bag picked up. I had no option but to leave the airport since I was refused boarding for being 3 minutes late with no security line (and I’m precheck.) I missed Mother’s Day dinner with my family and will not ever give AA one single dime in the future. I’ll stick with Southwest even though it’s an hour from my family’s town. AA customer service is absolutely horrendous."
652,"  Denver to Tallahassee via Dallas Fort Worth. It all started when we first got to Denver. They forgot our bag in Tallahassee and had to wait until the next day to get it. When it comes time to flight back to Tallahassee, our first flight gets delayed twice, to the point that it arrived 8 minutes before our connection flight left for Tallahassee. Of course we missed it, it couldn't account for those who had a flight before. When we asked for a compensation, the people that work for American said that since it was due to ""weather"" they couldn't compensate. But, how are we supposed to know how the weather is going to look like? After that we had to wait at the airport for over 12 hours for the next flight to Tallahassee. We had to sleep on the floor, not even a single blanket was provided. What I don't understand is why did we have to be treated so inhumanely when it wasn't even our mistake. They just blame everything on the ""weather"" and not even respect people's rights. Will never fly through this airline again."
653,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Detroit. American airlines is the worst airline! I always flight Delta, every time I fly American Airlines the flight gets delayed many hours or gets canceled. They say nonsense things about how the airplane was defective but that it wasn't their fault, and because of that they couldn't reimburse us. Do not fly American Airlines."
654,"Not Verified |  These guys just don’t get it! They cancelled my flight approx 10 hours prior to departure with no reason given. When rebooking they were unable to accommodate me at all on the same day of intended travel. My original flight was at 5am yet they could not send me anywhere at all that day. I was forced to spend an entire day and additional night (with hotel cost) before I could get home. After communicating with them, the reason for the cancellation (which the AA rep on the phone was unable to provide at the time) was weather. There were no weather issue at any of my travel points. Seems extremely convenient for them that the reason is also the one they claim to have no control over. So sad we can’t just get the truth from these legacy carriers. They refuse to own their issues."
655,"Not Verified |  
Dallas to Salt Lake City. What a joke of an airline. We bought our tickets in January and payed additional fees to select seats with more leg room. The agent for our first flight was kind enough to give us similar seats but we were told we would have to get our seats figured out with an agent at the following location. We were also told our bags would be forwarded to our final destination so there was no need to pick them up. That was a lie. Luckily, my husband had a feeling he should check and grabbed them. Then we spoke to an agent to get our boarding passes with the seats we payed for, she was rude and acted as if I was entitled for asking for what I payed for. Finally, she said she couldn’t assign us a seat and we would have to speak to an agent at the gate who would be there about an hour before boarding. No one showed up until 15 minutes before boarding was to start. The agent acted as if he was doing us a favor by saying he could get us on the flight. The seats we pre-selected and payed for were already taken. They couldn’t even offer us seats together. To top things off, the flight was delayed due to a no-show pilot. I travel fairly often and have never had a similar experience. We have never been refused seats we have selected online, much less ones we’ve payed extra for. I will never travel American again. I prefer to pay extra to fly with a company that can be trusted."
656,  Raleigh Durham to Dallas Ft Worth. Flight out of DFW going to Puerto Vallarta cancelled due to “weather” but storms had stopped several hours before our second scheduled flight was supposed to leave. Lost one night’s vacation and had to pay for hotel. Was not going to spend the night in the cold airport. We don’t believe weather was the issue. Not customer oriented. We think only doing what is best for the business. Not satisfied!
657,"  Raleigh to Las Vegas. I can’t explain the terrible customer service I’ve encountered throughout the day and into the night. Let’s just say, American Airlines will be the very last resort for future travels or not travel at all. The countless very unprofessional encounter with AA agents throughout this unforgettable experience push me to this extreme decision. Additionally, the extremely delayed updates i received to make informed decisions did not help in any way it just made this worst and I mean that in all forms (via email, text, gate agents, etc.) Bottom line is, it will take some convincing for me to change my point of view towards this airline. There are better options."
658,"Not Verified |  I have had such poor experiences with American Airlines. Left out of Nashville on Monday and was delayed over an hour in Nashville because of plane issues, missed my connecting flight in Chicago and had to rebook, fortunately I could get on the next flight to Denver. Coming home from Denver flight left on time to Chicago now still sitting in Chicago over an hour after we were supposed to take off. Gate change 3 times. Plane has finally arrived but hasn’t gotten to the gate yet. Again plane issues for the delay. Time has changed for departure 4 times in the last hour and a half. Last Christmas was leaving to go home from Christmas holidays in Wisconsin and had 3 planes that had mechanical issues and hadn’t found a plane to replace. Airline rebooked my flight 3 times that day when I finally said put on tomorrow’s flight. Sure was a sign I shouldn’t go that day. Guess my biggest complaint is all these planes had mechanical issues before anyone could board. Yes good they found the problem before it got in the air but they should be inspecting these planes and maintaining them what better than what they do. Charge passengers a ton of money to flight and then all you can do is sit and wait. No compensation or airlines held accountable."
659,"Not Verified |  There was a small thunderstorm in Charlotte NC so we sat on tarmac for 1.5 hours waiting for lightning to clear, totally understandable. Our connecting flight that leaves at 5.53 delayed till 7.30 then canceled due to weather, also understandable, rebooked and new plane leaves at 10.30. Delayed 6 times, canceled at 2am for no pilot, rebooked for 8 pm next day (not to Detroit to Toledo) on standby for 9.20 am flight. That was canceled for maintenance. 8.15 flight was delayed once and then canceled then booked for 5.22 am on Monday, not to Detroit, to Toledo. Wife in wheelchair whole time, no food voucher or hotel voucher offer. Expected to sit in airport for 36 hours and then don't even fly home to my state! Wont offer any reimbursement because it was weather related although only first flight was weather related. Horrible service!"
660,"  We were scheduled to fly from Miami to Orlando on May 6 2019, the flight was to depart at 3.30. Everything was fine we were just minutes from boarding, the previous flight had just deplaned and then a storm hit. The announcement was made that we were going to be delayed for an hour so we returned to the club. We arrived at the club and then received a text that the flight had been cancelled. We all have smart phones and can look at the radar and know that the storm had passed and the air had cleared up. I believe the flight was cancelled because of a mechanical issue and not weather related but to blame the weather keeps American from having to find hotel rooms for all the passengers effected. I went to the desk at the club to receive some help with getting us rebooked. The American airlines staff that I dealt with were less than professional or helpful. She actually told me to rent a car and drive to Orlando. (Well if I wanted to do that I wouldn't have contracted with American Airlines would I). She did get us on the stand by list for the 5:30pm flight. We arrived at the gate and were number 15 and 16 on the list, the gate agent was very nice and said he would do what he could to get us on the flight. The plane boarded and he called us to the gate and was able to get us on the plane. He said he couldn't get us in first class we were thankful to be on the flight. After a few minutes and first class being empty with the exception of a couple of seats our names were called and we were moved up to first class. American did finally rebook us for the next day on 2 different flights, we are just thankful we went stanby and were able to get home a bit late the same day."
661,Not Verified |  I had a flight from Dallas to San Diego and it was cancelled due to no pilots showing up after we sat on the plane for an hour. So I got another flight # 348 to Orange County and again no pilots. Sat in the plane for almost two hours. Flight was cancelled again. No offer from AA to put us up in a hotel. I will never fly American Airlines again.
662,"Not Verified | Pittsburgh to Tampa. Every single time I try and fly American Airlines, my flight gets cancelled and rebooked and cancelled again at least 4 times, resulting in my missing extremely important events which were the whole reason I was flying to begin with. I have literally never taken an American Airlines flight that was not cancelled multiple times after 4 plus hours of delays first. I missed my grandmother's funeral in July, and missed half of my vacation and a religious holiday planned with my family last month. American Airlines never offered lodging even though both times our flights were cancelled and not rebooked until the following day. American has also not gotten back to me after multiple official refund requests for tickets and seat upgrades on flights I never took. They really need to their stuff together before they run themselves into the ground. For a major airline to have such horrible logistics issues is embarrassing, and for them to not make any effort to even respond to refund requests is even worse. I have now spent over $3,000 on booking tickets through another airline, rebooking, baggage fees, overnight stays at hotels and rental cards I should not have had to spend if my flights would have just taken off as planned. Oh and missing my grandmothers funeral after paying $3k for those plane tickets alone is not fun either."
663,"  Dallas to Atlanta. You have to love a airline who creates a delay, placing your flight over 2 hours later then planned, then says there is another previously delayed flight that will get you to your destination at the original projected time. But you have to pay $75 for the convenience of changing flights. How does this make sense? American Airlines is a low rent, low-amenity company that is not worth saving $30-50 over Delta for what you lose."
664, Tampa to Vancouver via Dallas. Our first flight with AA was delayed from Tampa by almost an hour and then our connection flight from Dallas would not wait for our whole party of 6 before closing the doors by 30 seconds. Two of us were already at the gate and told American Airlines that the others in our party are running and they closed the door and yelled at me that they will call the security if I stayed there. The other 4 literally got there late because they were at the back of the plane on the primary flight and had to wait to deplane. This was the last flight out of Dallas for the day and we were told on our primary flight that because there were so many people on the primary flight with connections that the 2nd flight would most likely wait. They refuse to wait the extra 30 seconds for all of us to get there and told us they can’t help us and send us to rebook at 12 midnight. Very poor customer service.
665,"Not Verified |  So disappointed with American Airlines. We have been loyal customers for 15 years and were recently notified that our card was hacked through their system and 150,000 miles were stolen. Instead of going after the perpetrators, they let us know that we had to file a police report and that they could not help us. We repeatedly asked to have them call us to discuss the matter and they would only email. The one person my husband was able to talk to told him ""you should reply to the email so they know you are responsive, and they will take you more serious."" We have never had such an ordeal with any company we have done business with. Customers for 15 years and that doesn't make a bit of difference. Such a shame. We have had to take matters into our own hands. I know this is actually a huge problem with American Airlines and having miles stolen as I have heard similar stories. They should think about better security and help support the loyal customers they have. I have been so upset about this, that I had to take time out of my day to write this review, and it is the first time in my life I have ever had to write something negative about a company. Warning to anyone doing business with American Airlines - beware!"
666,"Not Verified |  We took off from New York Monday evening with the expectation that we would arrive in London at a specific time to make our connecting flight an hour and a half later to Tel Aviv. However, we got delayed an hour at JFK because of “problems with the engine”. In the past three or four times that I’ve flown with American, they’ve had “problems with the engine”.  We missed our flight to Tel Aviv and had to find a new one, and it caused us to miss Israel’s national Memorial Day, which was one of the primary reasons we wanted to go at this time of year. This is not our first experience with American, but it is certainly our last. I am never flying this airline again. To their credit, the flight itself was comfortable."
667,"Not Verified |  Fresno to Bradley. Flight was canceled twice on return trip, then a connected flight was delayed. Second connection flight from Phoenix to Chicago seated in different row than spouse when they assigned seats and when asked at the counter to be seated together the attitude of agent was “oh well that happens” and could not do anything and uninterested in helping. This along with the attitude of other staff reminded me why I dislike using American Airlines."
668, Los Angeles to Puerto Vallarta. Went to get on my flight and the flight attendant made me give up my carry on as he said there was no over head space. After I got on the flight it was clear that was not the case. I went back to the gate to get my bag to take back on the flight and would not let me do so since he had already tagged it. I tried to say that did not make sense as it was my bag and if it is with the owner they would not have any issues with me accusing the airline of misplacing my bag. After being extremely rude he then stated okay fine we can put you on the next flight. Uncalled for. Airlines should screen for staff to have better manners. Things like this is why upsetting things happen on planes and people stop flying with those companies. I will say I am now going to avoid American Airlines at all cost.
669,"  
Chicago to London. The worst company ever. This was my second flight with them and definitely last one. Never ever again. Lesson learned. My flight had been cancelled and when I took my rebooked a flight for the next day I had been downgraded from premium economy to economy. Very rude staff not willing to explain anything. They gave me $300 voucher for downgrade which you can’t even used online. When I told them I won’t be able to use it they said it was all they can do. Don’t used American Airlines, I would give them 0 as overall score unfortunately the lowest one is 1."
670,"Not Verified |  Buenos Aires to Miami. Not so nice staff, from the airport to the plane. Everyone looked indifferent, like they are just there for the money. Food onboard was okay, not a big of a deal. I have been flying with this airline a few times already. Seats are fine, just like any other airline in the market, same as the entertainment."
671,"  Dallas to Hong Kong. I booked a ticket from DFW to HKG to RMQ for April 22, 2019, The first leg was Business Class and the second was First Class. Flight was 4 hours late leaving Dallas which caused me to miss my connection in Hong Kong. I was scheduled to arrive in Taiwan on the 23rd and had a driver scheduled to pick me up at the airport and my hotel reservations for that night, as well as meetings scheduled for the 24th. When I arrived in Hong Kong I had to spend 16 hours there waiting for the flight out that American scheduled for the next day since their delay caused me to miss my connection. They booked me in economy class. I had to spend about three hours trying to reschedule my driver and hotel reservations in Taiwan and missed my meetings scheduled for the 24th because I did not arrive until 2 PM. I understand flight delays are normal but in this case it caused me an enormous amount of stress rescheduling everything and missing a day of work and meetings, when I spoke to American Airlines they offered me a $200 evoucher which is pocket change and an insult for the amount of time lost here. I would've been happy with someone acting as if my time lost and stress actually meant something instead of the mechanical response you get from the customer service team at American Airlines. I have learned maybe its time to switch back to United Airlines and MileagePlus."
672,"Not Verified |  Awful. Do not pay to upgrade to a better seat! I paid $200 to upgrade to better seats. The ‘better’ seats—were both broken. International flight—upgraded seats were worse than original seats. For $200, received less legroom than regular seats. Since our broken seats were locked upright for 9 hours, but the seats in front of us reclined steeply into our laps, knees and feet. Air stewards very sympathetic. Mostly because it was not their problem. AA could not have cared less. No upgraded seats and no refund for upgrading to broken seats courtesy of AA lousy maintenance. Seat in front killed my knees—which one has come to expect. But when one pays for upgraded seats and does not receive them and are not reimbursed for not receiving them, it is fraud. They want me to take a $100 voucher rather than make it right. What is the point of a voucher if one is never going to fly this airline again? Never again. I’ll connect rather than ever deal with this horrible airline ever again. Worst international ever."
673,"Not Verified |  Frankfurt to Charlotte. Given that there were 300+/- passengers on my international flight from Frankfurt to Charlotte, NC, there were only 4 of us on the flight who were unable to have audio on the flight, making it impossible to watch the entertainment provided to all the others during a 9 hour flight. I was told that, if we were American Advantage customers, we would be compensated with points. Just found out that the compensation of points for 9 miserable hours was 5000 points which won't come close to getting even a domestic ticket, much less compensating for the 9 hour flight. I have flown this route 4 times in the last 6 months and each time it strikes me how ""old"" and not well-maintained the aircraft seem to be. I will be looking for another airline for my next trip due to the poor customer service."
674,"  San Diego to Detroit. Worst flight I have ever been on. Worst customer service I have ever dealt with. My original flight was supposed to take me to Chicago, then to Toledo. Those flights got delayed, and there were no other flights to Toledo for the night. They suggested that I take the flight to Chicago and be stranded there for the night, making it very clear they would not pay for a hotel nor meals. I had them switch my flights around so I would go to Phoenix and then Detroit, which would get me an hour further from home but at least I wouldn't need to find somewhere to stay. Again, flights kept getting delayed. I was concerned I would miss my connecting flight from Phoenix to Detroit so I asked the lady working at the gate counter about it and she spoke to me for condescending.  She wasn't good at hiding her facial expressions. She talked to me like I was a child and was wasting her time. There was nobody behind me waiting to be helped, so it is not like she was even busy. She clearly does not need to be working in customer service. After I got to Phoenix, they boarded us on time to leave for Detroit, then had us sitting on the plane delayed for almost two hours with very few updates. Finally we figured out that something needed fixed on one of the planes wings, and it took this long to get someone there to fix it. Why board us all on a plane that may not even be operational in the first place, not sure. On top of all that, they gave us an old plane that we were unable to charge any of our devices on, AND I had a seat that did not move at all. So I got to be uncomfortable the entire flight with no form of entertainment. At one point I got up to get my sweatpants out of my bag because it was very cold, and the flight attendant just glared at me as if I was doing something wrong. I will never be booking with AA again. What was supposed to be a 6 hour trip turned into almost 20. Very poor customer service. I would give it a 0 star rating if I could."
675,"Not Verified |  Wow - what a way to tell your customer that you don't care about them. 3 flights within 12 months to the same destination to see our daughter at university in St. Kitts at Ross University and American tells me that they have the ""right"" to ""scheduled changes"" which seem to happen within 72 hours of the flight. So we pay top rate for the flight months in advance and then settle for a substitute flight with more stop overs for the same price last minute because we do not have any other choice. Well my daughter will be at Ross for another couple of years and when I cannot get a direct flight with Air Canada, I will book the British Airways flight from Buffalo (which is the solution I have to turn to when American Airlines AA cancels/alters/reschedules my flight last minute... again - remember happened 3 times). Buffalo flight has more connections but less issues than the AA American Airlines reschedule , cancelation , etc. BTW, after 2 hours on the phone with AA customers service I was told AA has 'the right"" to treat me the way they do and they do not have to do anything to make it up to me. ""So sad too bad"". When I asked them what regulating body I could complain to m they said there is non and I could email the AA customer relations. Here is the problem with an unregulated industry. Choice is yours - good luck ."
676,"  Los Angeles to Bradley via Philadelphia. My flight has been delayed because the flight attendants were late leaving the hotel. I wish that was a joke, but just announced on the P.A. Get it together! This is a job, not social hour. The hotels at LAX are right here! I commute for a living and am early every day because of planning. Now I got a call that my connection may be in jeopardy? Come on American! And they no longer have nonstop Bradley to Los Angeles. Very sad. That's why I started flying this airline"
677,Not Verified |  Philadelphia to Miami. This airline is absolutely awful. Our flight was cancelled last minute and American did absolutely nothing to accommodate us. Do not fly. Our preplanned 3 month trip was ruined. We paid for an extra day at our resort that we never got to use. Thanks American for a great start to our honeymoon.
678," Miami to Charleston. This has been the worst experience ever. From the reservation manager, to the slow TSA check-in process, to the boarding agents! The customer service is poor! And thanks to American Airlines for placing me on numerous stand by flights, I had to to stay another unwanted night. The employees were rude and unhelpful. Never again will I fly with American Airlines! Terrible! Terrible! Oh, if you want to catch your flight, arrive 4 hours prior to your boarding time. The staff in the Miami International Airport are terrible."
679,"  American Airlines delayed my flight from Houston and when I got to Dallas, my connection flight gate was closed 12 mins before departure knowing full well I was running late from my other flight. The attendant showed a nonchalant attitude at the gate and simply told me to wait for the next flight in 5 hours and walked away. Very rude and unprofessional."
680," Although we managed to check in online for this flight we were unable to select seats for our onward connecting flight to Heathrow with BA. So on arrival at the airport we joined the long queue for Customer Services. After several minutes a member of staff who was questioning people in the queue advised that our issue could be resolved by using one of the Self Service machines. So off to join another queue for a machine to become available. Unfortunately we were we unable to select seats or print Boarding Passes for our transatlantic flight. However we successfully managed to print off Boarding Passes for the MIA–YYZ sector. At the same time another piece of paper was output which stated that we could not print off our luggage tags as the connecting time in Toronto was too short. This despite the fact that the flights were booked over 6 months ago on the AA website. So back to the now longer queue for Customer Services. This queue moved very slowly and the number of agents dealing with passenger requests varied from two to five. Given the length of the line this was totally unacceptable. Well over two hours after arriving at the airport we actually managed to speak to someone who could help us. Our bags were eventually taken from us and tagged from MIA to YYZ to LHR. Once on board the flight was fine and departed and arrived on time. More stress at Toronto as it was not only necessary to pass through Immigration, but also pick up our bags, clear customs and then drop off the bags at the BA desk which had closed. Thankfully, a very understanding and helpful member of staff took pity on us. We managed to get to the gate just as the last passengers were boarding. The bottom line is that AA should never have booked these flights given the unacceptably short transit time in Toronto."
681,"  Not a first time traveler, however this may have been one of my first times on American Airlines. It was the worst travel experience of my life. We get to national airport and wait for the flight. I look up and notice, there is a delay. No big deal I’ve had delays before. So we wait. Finally they are boarding. We get on the plane and taxi out to the runway. We stop, pilot announces we are delayed again because we can not get air to the engine. As we sit on the runway, there is no air being circulated through the vents. It’s hot and keeps getting hotter. The woman behind me tells the flight attendant we need air, you can’t keep us on the plane like this. After an hour like this, people are sweating and feeling faint. Another woman asks if her and her infant child can get off as it’s not safe for an infant. The flight attendants reply was “sorry, we are all hot. You’ll just have to deal till we get going”. After 2 hours in the incredible heat they allow us to deplane. It was such a relief walking back to the air conditioned terminal. I wouldn’t even leave my dog in the car like that for 2 hours but I suppose American Airlines doesn’t care about leaving a whole plane in the smoldering heat. Shame on them! Another delay followed by another delay. Now I’m getting worried as I do need to be in Orlando by 8:00 that morning. I know our flight choices will be limited if they end up canceling this AA flight. I saw a flight leaving Dulles ( 20 min drive away ) 10:30 pm. I asked the gate agent should I head to Dulles or what is the likelihood this plane is leaving tonight? He said hold tight. I asked if I can get my luggage so I can have a chance at another flight. He literally said to me “if you were Nancy Pelosi or Oprah we could give you your bags”. Hmm? So because I’m not a politician or a celebrity I don’t matter? Nice AA customer service right there! So we wait. Like he said our flight did leave that evening. I think we took off around 11:00. I know we landed in Orlando by 1:30am. After getting rental car, and drive to our hotel we made it to bed by 3:00am only to be up again at 6:00am. I honestly wasn’t going to write a review for this part but what comes next. I will never again fly American... We end up enjoying our stay in Orlando. We are set to fly out Monday April 29 3:00pm. Sunday night we are all packed up and checked in. Only to wake up to a text from American 7:00am stating our flights have been canceled. They can rebook us for a flight the following day. I can’t miss another day at work, the kids have to get to school. What about the rental car and hotel? I have to pay extra for this too? Frustrated I dial AA customer service to be greeted by a machine and prompted to speak to a robot till I can finally get an agent on the line. The agent tells me we can book you Tuesday or nothing at all. She is apologetic, however can’t do a thing to help me. She basically tells me that’s all I can do for you, have a nice day. I ask to speak with a supervisor. After a brief hold the supervisor gets on the line to tell me she can book a flight with another airline. Well at least now we are getting somewhere. She tries to book with Delta but during the booking she says the seats sold out. She says she can get me an AA flight landing in BWI which is an hour from my home, so will AA pay for that Uber ride? She says no, we’ll have to figure that out on our own. Again, maybe if I was Nancy Pelosi or Oprah!"
682,"  New Orleans to Miami. Very good flight. Departed and left on time. Seats are decent, Wifi is acceptable and so is the complimentary inflight service. Nice crew (smiling, which is the key..). Flight was full and some of us had to leave the luggage in the hold. Even if there was still plenty space in the overhead bin (empty above our seat). Still, check in was smooth and luggage arrived fairly as on the belt. AA has worked just fine for us."
683,Not Verified |  Chicago to New York. Customer service at the airport was terrible. My flight was delayed and in the end got cancelled. No voucher for hotel or a different airline and I spent more than 24 hours at the airport. This is my second time and I'm very disappointed. American Airline is trash!
684,"  Phoenix to Los Angeles. Ticket Agent checked me in & her service towards me was only OK, no eye contact, nothing. The customers in front of me that she checked in, concerned me a bit. There was a lady who was obviously overwhelmed trying to condense her suitcase after the agent told her to. In the midst of her condensing her bag, the agent asked the lady what her seat number was without giving the lady proper time to answer her question. The agent questioned her in a rude manner, “You don’t know what your seat number is!?” She asked her as if she was disappointed and frustrated. This staff seemed very disengaged, rushed and unpleasant. I understand that things get busy but it is not your job just to do your job. Customers deserve quality service. "
685,"  Cancun to Milan via Miami. We were six counting a handicap person and an infant (2 years). Our flight took off delayed of one hour from Cancun, when we finally arrived in MIA we had only about 1 hour to the connection. So then the 1st soap opera began, no one came to take my stepfather (the handicap) at the plane, after 10 min some one came and left him at a place with others, then the lady from AA said we should reschedule our flight home for the other day, after a brief discussion she called someone and he and my mother went one way and my sister, niece and brother in law in another. We used the APC (Automated Passport Control) and went to the line, or should i say lines, i went one way. then security control. We all met after SC and went to the gate, there the second soap opera began. apparently some battery had to be changed and after multiple delays, emails, and texts and about 3 hours waiting later they decided to change the airplane, so we had to change gates too. more one hour waiting. So boarding began and after everyone were cozy (as much as you can be on a old AA aircraft) all kinds of excuses began. 1st was that we were waiting the green light from Dallas; 2nd the hours of the pilots were over so they had to call other, then it was the time of the crew (they cancelled a flight to Rio so they came to our plane) all that took us about 4 hours inside the aircraft and all they offered us was a glass of water. i can say with certainty that i will never set foot on a AA plane again, i don't care how much more i have to pay,"
686,"  Have never had a good experience with American Airlines. Whether it's technical issues, engine problems, or booking issues, there never ceases to be something that goes wrong. On this flight, I was 3 minutes late to check my bag and they would not allow me to proceed without checking it. Therefore, I got a seperate flight in order to check my bag, layover through Chicago, and have been put on standby with every flight to Boston. American Airlines overbooks most their flights, and they claim my only option is to continue on standby. When asked how long they can keep doing that, I got the reply, ""that answer is immeasurable."" Which brings me to another point, the customer service is awful! I've interacted with at least 10 different people here for help and only 1 has been nice/useful. I'm not surprised they are all in bad moods because I imagine their complaint level is through the roof. Moral of the story, I have learned my lesson to never fly with American Airlines again. Sincerely, A customer still waiting in Chicago"
687," The workers were unkind, unhelpful, and deceitful. I had a bag that clearly qualifies as a carry on bag. That wasn’t a problem. The problem, even after the customer service was terrible, was that the supervisors said I had to check my bag because the flight was full, and there was no overhead storage. They said my bag has to go to Akron. I told them clearly that I had bought this ticket through NYC because I knew there was a chance I’d have to stay in NYC for work. As I continued to explain to them the situation they told me that I could see a supervisor in NYC and get my bag back there if I was willing to pay the fare difference (presumably the difference in the flight I just took, not going to Akron a whole flight less!). We went back and forth as to how silly what they were saying was, and here’s the kicker, I get on the plane and there are many empty seats and even a couple rows totally empty! And of course, storage space. There was plenty of space for my bag. Again, not helpful, rude, and at the end of the day deceitful. So, will I get to be in NYC for work with my clothing and toiletries? If they need me in New York, I will not be in anything but my travel clothes and my bag will be lost in Akron and I will have to pay for a flight I don’t take and pay for the bag to be shipped to me. That’s absolutely poor American Airlines. If you’re looking for was of travel, honesty, and transparency, do not fly American Airlines. I will not fly that airline again."
688," Dallas to Ontario. Zero stars if possible. Closed out from the restaurant, they took a little longer than they should have. Walking up to the gate, literally shut the door in our face 10 min before our departure time. Ugly attitudes and horrible service. They could have waited 30 seconds and could have walked on. I will stay away from American Airlines as much as possible."
689,"  I usually fly on American Airlines, because I live near one of their hubs and am an Admirals Club member. I have been battling cancer for the past 2 1/2 years and American took away my status and did not allow me to put my Admirals Club membership on hold. They have all this publicity during October for Breast cancer awareness but they don't support the people actually battling cancer. I am going to do some research and possibly take my business to Delta."
690,"  The past 26 hours have been hell. I was scheduled to arrive at San Diego yesterday at 11.30pm, instead I was rerouted to Waco Texas where I was forced to spend the night at the airport freezing cold since all my clothes were in my luggage. They gave my a flight the next day to san Diego at 7pm, it is currently 9.57pm I have yet to take off. We were delayed because of ""mechanical issues "" one of the stupid luggage racks wouldn't close properly. They have not offered any kind of compensation for any of the inconveniences this has caused me. At this point I would have already had made it to san Diego if I had rented a car and drove yesterday evening."
691,"Not Verified |  Paris to Mexico via Dallas. The online check in didn’t work therefore we had to wait at a customer desk. After we were already queuing for almost 2 hours they took us apart because otherwise we would miss our flight. However, the people after is in the line were checked in before we even had the chance after they gave us “priority”. As we had to check in fast, they didn’t want to check us in together, therefore we had a 12 hour flight where me and my friends were seated on different places, not even a bit close to each other. We asked many times to seat us together but they didn’t listen at all. "
692,"Not Verified |  San Francisco to San Jose via Dallas. Absolutely terrible customer service. Flight attendants were downright rude, did not take the initiative to help passengers, and did not dress or act professionally. Worst airline I've ever taken."
693,"  I was flying out of Atlanta, GA this past Friday on a flight to Miami, connecting to Houston and the trip was cancelled hours before departure. I first called the customer service line, where I was told by an agent, ""I shouldn't have booked my ticket the way I did"" & there was nothing she could do. I then went to the AA ticket counter and the representatives shut down the line because it was too many people to deal with and they sent us to main gate for further assistance after waiting in line for 1 hour. I was placed on a standby flight for 6:50am the following day (in which that flight was full) & i could not board. The ticket agent then put me on standby for the next departing flight leaving at 9:14am, but told me because my name was so deep in the list, she couldn't be of much assistance. She let every passenger board standby except me. I then had to catch a flight to DC from Atlanta, just to get to Miami. 24 hours spent in an airport with the utmost rude and unprofessional people I've ever encountered.. oh it gets better... my flight (AA1545) from Miami to Atlanta was not only delayed again , but AA then told me that my carry-on bag was now ""too big"" and forced me to pay the check-in bag fee, only for me to arrive to my gate & AA was checking in bags complimentary."
694,"Not Verified |  Chicago to Phoenix. I am an Exec Platinum on American after recently switching from United (work reasons). I booked my family in first class (paid revenue seats) and fully expected them to enjoy their experience coming home from spring break. It was completely the opposite. My wife had to fly back with two of my three kids while I flew back with my other daughter because of high school sports. My wife and two other kids were flying back in First class. Checked in, and 10 minutes before boarding the gate agent proceeded to tell my wife the kids lost their first class seats and were being moved to coach, and couldnt be seated together. WTF. We paid for first class seats, they allege there was an equipment change, but only 2 people were moved out of first class (my kids). My two kids and separated from their mother on the plane. They are minors. In addition, they did this 10 minutes before boarding! They offered a refund of the difference in fair (130 dollars) and a 300 dollar voucher. This is completely unacceptable. And you know who sat in the two seats that were taken from my kids? two other kids. American could have handled this with some class 1. offered another flight in first class 2. offer a voucher that covers enough for two tickets in first class 3. rebook us on another airline in first class or rebook the other family on one of the above options 4. offer miles deposited to cover a first class ticket I am going back to United. I spend between 20-40k a year on travel and have never had this issue with United. I float between 1k and global services on united and will never spend a dime on American EVER AGAIN. F-them. Whats the point of spending money on a first class ticket to be treated worse than luggage? Absolutely horrible service."
695,"  La Guardia to Orlando. Horrible service! Will never fly American again. We usually fly Delta to Europe. We traveled with 4 kids early in the am. The staff was rude, unhelpful. In fact one of the male stewards was extremely rude and instead of offering to help get our family settled, he was rudely trying to rush us. I've never experienced such a rude group on a plane. Even before we entered the aircraft, we were scolded because they wanted us to get our stroller ready sooner. We had 4 sleeping babies with us and it was 5:30am! Never again"
696,"Not Verified |  Raleigh/Durham to London. One off the strangest flights i have been on; one cabin crew member very rude and snappy with passengers. One passenger asked for a blanket because for some reason his seat didn’t have one and her response was ‘well what do you want me to do about it?! We put one on every seat, if its not there its because someone has stolen it so you have your fellow passengers to blame for that!’. Then the couple on front asked to move seats so she said she would go check if there were any free, comes back a few mins later and said ‘There are two seats together at the back, one of those nasty passengers back there tried to move into it but i stopped him for you, thank me later’ genuinely referred to them as ‘nasty passengers’. =. Even her body language and way she moved about the cabin and interacted with people just wasn’t what you would expect from cabin crew at all and if it hasn’t been for the uniform you wouldn’t think she was cabin crew who are usually friendly, approachable and nothing but helpful. Plus there was supposed to be wifi on the flight but it didn’t work."
697," Dallas to Salt Lake City. Horrible. I had a connecting flight from DFW airport to SLC. We boarded just fine, then after sitting on the plane and waiting 20 minutes after the last person loaded they informed us there would be a 20 minute delay. 20 minutes later they told us it would be a while longer. 1 hour after boarding the plane they tell us the plane has mechanical problems and it could not be flown that night (I understand that, better safe than sorry!). They spent the next 2 hours telling us to sit, move, we have a plane, now we don't. Total chaos! 3 hours after we were supposed to leave they told us we wouldn't have a plane for 6 hours (overnight). They wouldn't help us find hotel rooms, wouldn't give us vouchers for a room or food. Nothing. Oh and when we finally all boarded the aircraft after sleeping on the airport terminal floor all night, we had to wait an additional hour for them to find all the luggage and get it switched over!"
698,Not Verified |  Raleigh Durham to Tuscon. I am blown away by how dumb this airline has gotten. I'm on a plane right now with half of the seats empty. All I wanted to do was move to and empty row so I am not on top of people and the flight attendant tells me I have to pay extra to move from my seat! Are you kidding me? I have to pay extra for a seat that no one is sitting in anyways! How far has this airline fallen? Are we that hard up nowadays that we can't change a seat on an empty  airplane. I am absolutely blown away by the stupidity of this. No more American airlines for me. If they are hurting for money that bad maybe it's time to call it quits. There's no shame in cutting your losses and shutting it down. 
699," We will never fly American Airlines again. The customer service was non-existent. I would avoid any layovers in Philadelphia as the airport is understaffed with AA personal and extremely lazy. After our flight was cancelled due to the pilots leaving the plane and no one coming to replace them we were not given any accommodation, reimbursement and they could only put us on a flight 2 days after our original arrival date."
700," Omaha to Dallas Fort-Worth via Las Vegas. American Airlines has the rudest, most uninformed workers I've ever seen. Instead of treating the customers poorly they should be apologizing for their delay or apologizing because they don't know where to find them the transportation they need to get through the airport. But no they're rude and act like it's our fault that we don't know how to do their job, if they don't like their job they need to find a new one. Furthermore if they don't know how to do their job they need to tell they're Superior so they can find someone who can."
701,"Not Verified |  Memphis to Colorado Springs. My wife was scheduled to fly out at 6 am on April 20, 2019. She received a text at 7 pm on April 19 stating that her flight had been cancelled. The reason she booked an early flight was so she could be in Colorado Springs shortly after our son gets off work. He’s stationed at Peterson AFB in Colorado Springs. She was booked a flight 6 hours later than originally. Which puts her coming into Colorado Springs about the time he leaves for work. Not a lot of time for him to pick her up, get back on base, get her checked in at a room on base and then get to work. She called to see why her flight was cancelled and the CSR said it was due to maintenance. Not real happy with American Airlines and the short notice of the cancellation."
702,"Not Verified | Chicago to Puerto Vallarta. American Airlines has terrible customer service at O’Hare. Came from over-crowded Admirals Club to find flight delayed, no explanation from ground crew, passengers crowded in “cul de sac” at end of concourse, many passengers sitting on the floor. I’m Plat Exec, but am going to switch to another airline."
703," The stewards on my flight from Charlotte to Ft Lauderdale (flight 0033) were nothing short of amazing! They were pleasant, always smiling and really went out of their way to help me. I dont normally fly American Airlines, but I will again. "
704,"  As I am writing this I am sitting in LAX. American Airlines has been the low point of my family's trip. My flight to LAX was delayed, and we had to race to get to our connecting flight back to Boston. Even though they had radioed to let the gate know we where on the way they would not let us board or hold the gate for even a minute even though it was thier fault we were late. When we went to customer service we were informed they could get us on another airline, but only if we were advantage status customers. Because we where just regular customers we would not be able to fly out until the morning. The 2 girls at the customer service area ar LAX had the personality of soulless automatons. The experience flying with American has been hot garbage from the lack of just commonly decent politeness to the barrage of ads and flyers handed out by the flight crew to sign up for thier credit card. Needless to say my next flight will not be with this airline, as they are so fond of reminding me during this trip I do have a choice in airlines."
705,"Not Verified |  San Francisco to Phoenix. American Airlines is the worst airline I’ve ever flown with. Every time I fly with this horrible company there is a ridiculous inconvenience. I’ve had cancelled flights, several hours in delays, and to deplane too many times to count. I always tell myself it is the last time I fly American Airlines, but today is most definitely the last straw.  I write this review as I’m deplaning their aircraft, yet again, for some stupid problem they couldn’t figure out ahead of time. "
706,"  Austin to Miami. We will never fly American Airlines again. I would have loved to write a review on American airlines website to tell them about my experience however American airlines only gives you 7 days from your flight date to write a review. I couldnt have within this time frame since I was still on vacation internationally. This flight I'm referring to was on 4/8 from Austin to Miami. From the very beginning it was the most rocky turbulent flight I have ever been on. All the people around us was commenting on the turbulence.  The plane then drops and then shoots up again.  The pilot came on the intercom and said. ""Sorry about that folks, we were a little to close to the plane in front of us. We will have to circle around and try to land again. It will be about 5 minutes"". We finally land and we took forever to taxi to get off the plane. We had another flight to catch and we had hoped to still make it. No one on the intercom told us anything about our connecting flight. We had to run from gate 19 to gate 49. We had 8 minutes to spare and the plane was already pulling away. They did not call our names over the intercom or call out for final boarding. They just left even though it wasn't our fault. We ran to the next gate to tell them but they just told us there isnt anything they can do and to go to the rebooking center. Then we had to walk back to gate 37 to the rebooking center. We talked to the agent told them what happened. She has no sympathy, no compassion and a huge attitude.  We rebooked for a few hours later. But, better customer service and compassion and a heartfelt apology would have gone a long way in this situation. We got neither."
707,"Not Verified |  I had a great one way trip with American Airlines beginning with the curbside baggage and boarding pass agent at the Atlanta airport, a very patient and helpful young man. Next the wheelchair assist woman Pam was very kind and helpful, we had a nice conversation on the way to my gate. One flight attendant was outstanding, with a smile while serving my cup of ice. The flight was very nice, quite cloudy with little turbulence. "
708,"  Philadelphia to Las Vegas. Since most airlines have flyers right where they want them, the front of the plane is the only place left with enough seat to actually sit in for a 5-hour flight. At over $2,300.00 for my Wife and I, not worth it, but still better than the ""Cattle Car Crush"" in the back. Unfortunately, we only had an hour in our seats, before we were forced out, after we had taxied out, then back in, to change the flight crew. (Due to ""Time Out"" of flying/ resting hours) I guess American doesn't own any computers, with which to calculate this before they spend an hour jamming 125 captives into a 30-year old flying tour bus. I forgot to mention we only boarded after being chased to 3 different gates, the last being from one end of PHL to the other. I read Americans ""Service Promise"" the day after our 7 hour delay/ cancellation and wondered where the promised ""Over 3-hour delay comforts"" food & drinks were? Certainly not given to us, nor was ANY information as to why we were sitting in 3) different gates, watching 200 American planes land and depart, while we sat and stewed. The final kick in the sac was watching the new flight crew board, then stand back in line for another hour, with no info. We were then lied to again, and were told that ""Maintenance"" decided to sniff around, while we stood and waited to re-board. At 10:20 at night, the flight attendants filed off our 6:35 departure aircraft, and a passenger yelled: ""This means the flight is cancelled!!"" With no word from any of the arrogant, attitude-laden gate agents. They finally announced to go back to the other end of the terminal, and get our bags, and beat it. No help, no rebooking assists, no nothing. American is the worst possible company to ever give your hard-earned cash to. The little tags say it all: ""We don't care, and we let you know it!"" "
709,Not Verified |  Detroit to San Antonio. After Air Tran went out of business I have flown American Airlines. I am handicap. They always go over and above anything I expect. From the time I book until I return home I am treated exceptionally well. Love to give credit when its due. Thank you American
710,"  Washington to West Palm Beach. I was planning to take my bag as a carry on and they had no more room up above the seats, so we were told to check our bags at the gate. When I received my bag at baggage claim my bag had a huge cut in the front of it that was not there before. This is only my second time using this suitcase and it already looks so worn. I am extremely disappointed by this and deterred from using this Airline anymore."
711,"  New Orleans to Vancouver via Dallas. My husband and I had an extremely frustrating experience today. We were flying from New Orleans to Vancouver, via Dallas. The flight to Dallas was delayed. We were afraid we’d miss our connection to Vancouver and were thinking of getting on a flight to Dallas with another airline, but we talked to an agent at the gate, and he kept assuring everyone that “all connections are fine.” They were anything but. We departed late and arrived late. We still had a chance of making our original flight, but when we got to the gate, it was occupied. There were many passengers who had connecting flights on the plane, including international ones. One would have thought that knowing this, the airline would try to secure an unoccupied gate (how many gates can be occupied at one time? hard to imagine that the answer is “all”). But one would be wrong. We had to stay on the plane for more than an hour. We missed the original connection (as did many other passengers). Unfortunately, there were no other flights to Vancouver from Dallas tonight. We decided to take a flight to Seattle, rent a car, and drive to Vancouver. There was a flight with American Airlines leaving shortly after we arrived. We asked the agents at the gate for the Seattle flight to put us on it, but apparently, they had no authority to do that. We went to the rebooking counter. There was a long line there. We called customer service while standing in line. They called back shortly before our turn came. We managed to get rebooked on the flight to Seattle, but when we got to the gate, the agent told us that the gates were closed. The plane was sitting there and continued to sit there for another 20 minutes, but we could only watch from outside. We are not going on vacation and have to be in Vancouver for a conference at 9 am tomorrow. If we cannot make it by then, there is no point in going at all. We’ll do our best to avoid traveling with this airline in the future."
712,  Very terrible airline. We were getting ready to fly back to Chicago from Las Vegas when our flight was cancelled because of weather in Chicago. American couldn’t get us on a flight the next day or the day after. They said they could get us on a flight 3 days later. No offer to reimburse us or try another airline. I will never fly American.
713,"Not Verified | Cancun to London via Miami. Absolutely terrible. Please do yourself a favour and avoid it as a plague. Rude, arrogant staff, no information, totally unhelpful. It’s just a joke. You feel like intruder. There is no urgency to do anything. You just feel hopeless. But if you think airplane staff is horrible, wait to get to Miami International airport. It’s just horrible! Where is the management? Customer service, ground staff, customs - one big joke! No information, you're supposed to just guess it all yourself. Long queues everywhere. Staff doesn’t bother to help. Extremely rude and arrogant. Just horrible. Missed 2 connections flight before got to the front of re-booking desk. Also, if you are issued with express transfer cards it doesn’t mean express at all. You will be welcomed with another long line with one counter open! And even if none of delays where cause by myself they don’t care! We managed to get on BA flight back home after 5 hours struggle at Miami airport. What a relief and such a difference! By the way our 3 suitcase are still missing somewhere at Miami airport. I wish I never used American Airlines. I hated every minute of travelling with them."
714,"  Flew with American Airlines to San Francisco from Fort Lauderdale. As there were no direct flights we had to transit in Dallas. Having flown with numerous domestic airlines in the USA, I found American to be very good. Flights were on time, cabin crew friendly, and an easy transit in Dallas. One thing I found a bit annoying was that the aircraft from FLL to DFW had a personal entertainment screen, then the flight from DFW to SFO you could watch entertainment, but on your own device only. I had to spend $10 on wifi to download the American Airlines app on my iPad while flying (if it were a 1 hour flight I wouldn't have bothered, but this was a 4 hour flight). I didn't eat the food as I brought my own snacks. Planes seemed new and seats were quite comfy."
715,"  Lexington to Norfolk via Charlotte. I would ride a horse to my destination before I ever fly American Airlines again! Total disaster from the start! Plane sat at gate for over an hour due to “weather.” I was checking on my phone the entire time. Actually made it worse by waiting. Arrived in Charlotte very late. Once again, waited on taxi forever. Finally parked as far away from terminal as possible. No ramp, had to walk in from outside. Ran as fast as I could. Barely missed connector. Wouldn’t pay for hotel or even give me a discount room. Extremely rude and uncaring service. Got to hotel at 1am and was supposed to leave at 8:20 this morning. Woke up at 6 and on way to airport got notification that my flight was delayed for 2 hours once again! American is a joke!"
716,Not Verified |  Miami to Dallas. Very friendly and professional staff but I will probably never fly American again. My fiancé and I didn’t get to sit by each other on 2 of our 3 flights even though we booked back in March. Probably wouldn’t have bothered me as much if we hadn’t been over 7 isles away from each other and if I hadn’t learned that the couple next to me has just booked their flight and were able to be next to each other. If you don’t have tons of money for better tickets I do not recommend this airline because they obviously only care about the dollar.
717,"  Due to weather conditions my flight was canceled on Sunday evening (4/14/19), I completely understand weather delays, and did not complain in regards to the reschedule. However, when sending confirmation details American Airlines asks the flyer to confirm the new flight. Everytime, I tried to confirm through their website - it would crash. But! Their is the mobile app! Which also was unable to confirm and stated a call was necessary. No problem, I can call customer service. It was a 7hr wait for a call back when their own service stated 2hr call back times over the phone. When I finally got through to a representative - her first question was to ask if I had booked through a third party and to try to tell me the flight was voided. After, begging her to look up the flight via the record conformation number she was able to confirm me on the flight. Onto, Monday(4/15) one of the flight legs on the rescheduled flight has been canceled. They cannot even get me to Chicago without adding an additional day, possibly leaving me stranded in LaGuardia, NY. I am uncertain of the conditions of American Airlines flying to other cities, my case was from Boston to Chicago - two large airports, but unless you are flying to their major hub in Texas. I would avoid American Airlines until Oct 2019 when it seems they might have more planes in circulation. While the front counter staff were kind and tried to help as much as they could, American Airlines simply does not have enough resources to guarantee you a flight. If your flight is cancelled they do not have enough flights for a reschedule, all flights are overbooked and they do not seem to have any relationships with any partner airlines to help you get back on track. As of this American would of gotten me back to Chicago from Boston three days after my scheduled depart date. At this point I chose to book another ticket with Southwest Airlines who will get me into Chicago tonight. I know a lot of good folks work at American, but they simply do not have the most basic functionality down. Get to point A from point B on a plan within a reasonable amt of time. The only thing that seemed to work was at some point in time they will give you a call back to try to deny your flight's existence. I will take my business elsewhere going forward."
718," I purchased a ticket last minute to visit my Dad who is in the hospital due to complications from a surgery. The flight was delayed several times due to bad weather in the connecting city. The gate agent in Madison was kind enough to reroute me on another airline to eventually get to McAllen the same day, just 11pm instead of noon. Since my very short trip was very short now, I called the customer service line to see if I could change my returning flight to the next day, I wanted to see my Dads doctor, since I arrived very late Saturday night they were not in to see him on Sun. The Customer rep was very helpful, they changed my flight, even though most of the delays were weather related, and I had non refundable tickets, I am very thankful to American Airlines, they were compassionate and very understanding. Thank you American Airlines!"
719,Not Verified | Little Rock to New York. Worst experience ever!! I will never fly with this airline again. My flight going home was first delayed by an hour. Than it was cancelled due to mechanical issues. They automatically booked me on another flight for a later time which meant I'd miss my connecting flight. So I had to choose another flight home. Next thing that flight was cancelled and they automatically rebooked me for the next day. This was due to weather. They refused to pay for hotel stay overnight. They refused to pay for me flying another airline home. I ended up booking with Delta that same day and getting home about the same time I was originally scheduled to get home. I followed the progress of the flight the next day and saw it had been rescheduled yet again! This airline only cares about getting their money and nothing else.
720,"  Chicago to Los Angeles. I've had to fly American Airlines a lot due to corporate policy and not one of those flights has ever been reasonably close to on-time. Whenever I have to travel with this potpourri of incompetents, I assume the flight is leaving two hours later than what the schedule says.  Today, not only was my flight to LA canceled (while Delta and United are somehow, as if by magic, were still able to fly), leaving me up the creek for an important meeting tomorrow, when I called their national line to reschedule and input my information, it hung up 0n me. Just ""we're experiencing high call volume, please call again later."" So I call again and get put on a waiting list, being told I'll get a call back in 2 hours. It is now going on three hours, no call. While I was waiting, about an hour ago, I get a text message saying that I've been rescheduled for a flight to LAX on Wednesday.  So I call to cancel and reschedule the whole business myself, scratching the LA leg of my trip entirely. I make it through the phone menu and get to the point where it says it'll connect me to a service representative. And then, it hangs up on me again. I am never flying this airline again, even if I have to pay the difference for a United or Delta ticket out of my own pocket."
721,  Dallas to Toronto. I will never in my life ever consider flying on American Airlines again. Apart from the extremely smug staff and almost non existent platform for assistance for re booking our experience was horrible. The original flight got delayed “due to the weather” and had the same excuse used several times and after 4h30 they cancelled. The flight was re-booked not even for the Sunday but only for the Tuesday! Not only is that a kick to the customers that want to go home but in gods name who would think someone would want to stay a whole  2 days with no accommodations. Instead what we got was smug pilots and staff holding a pizza box walking away with no vouchers or anything. It’s gotten to the point where you really gotta ask yourself if these people are qualified or they purposefully don’t care for others.
722,"Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Charlotte. Unreliable with a poor customer service. Our flight got cancelled due to technical problem, we were booked to a stop flights which first flight was delayed so you would arrive 30 minutes after your connection had left but they didn't care and have us a boarding pass to fool us. By looking at monitors we realized what was going on, one more time we got to long line of customer services and after a long wait, we were booked to a over night flight to arrive next day. Meanwhile I was checking available flight on Google and there was a United leaving soon but they took so long and by misguiding us it was too late to make to the gate for boarding. There was plenty flights with Delta available but they said they have no access to that which I don't believe it. They just wanted to fill up their own flights. They never offer any voucher for food or drink and I was told to open a claim on line and they would reimburse me for expenses during 10 hours wait, I just got an email telling me they can't do that but they give me some stupid AA points which serve for nothing. Useless company."
723,"Not Verified |  Do not book American Airlines. Even if you are booking to save money.  My flight was scheduled to leave on a Sunday but was cancelled with no reschedule until Tuesday. They have strict internal policies that do not allow them to upgrade / book other airlines if they have an opening. This is primarily driven by American Airlines not wanting to pay the difference in cost. Instead they decide to put the passengers life on hold in a poor hotel for two days. Note the delay was not weather related, but a maintenance problem with their aircraft - they should have a better back up plan. One day delay is acceptable- two days is not! In some cases passengers were delayed 3 days. Also note there are no exceptions made, even if you have a medical issue.  Also the front counter attendant was extremely rude. While trying to work thru the problem the attendant just walked away and shut down her computer left me to figure it out like my own problem. Do not fly American Airlines."
724,"  Avoid this airline like the plague. Flight from Mexico City to Dallas delayed two hours for technical issues and thus caused the connection time to be shortened in Dallas. No assistance was provided on arrival and I was told that I had been put on another flight to Tokyo. However my initial flying class was Premium Economy but was told I was going to fly coach. After much arguing, I was put back on my initial flight that had not left yet. Because of severe thunderstorms this flight was cancelled and had to be changed to a later flight in Economy. While I understand weather issues are beyond airlines control, the rude and dismissive way American Airlines staff on the ground handled this was not worthy of an airline that prides itself of going for great. Lastly, the service on board the flight was non existent, the flight attendants looked tired and in need of proper grooming and the food barely edible. I will not fly with this airline again."
725,"  Houston to Managua via Miami. Very bad services, delayed the flight twice in one day and also they couldn’t have a connection flight to our final destination. They ruined our spring vacation."
726,"  Jacksonville to Dallas Ft Worth. One star is high rating. Zero communication. We found out that our flight was cancelled when we arrived at the gate. They couldn’t get us on another flight home  until two days later. If we were informed in advance (an hour and a half would’ve worked, I doubt they decided it the last 30 minuets) we could’ve rebooked our room or stayed at the resort until we figured how to get home but instead we dragged our two-year-old around the airport in zero comfort. Later we found that the airline had severe hail damage the previous day which explains the cancellation but also means they had plenty of time to inform affected passengers."
727,Not Verified |  Dallas to Norfolk. Word of warning to anyone planning a trip on American Airlines. They do not care about their customers. Yesterday my flight was delayed for hours in Dallas due to weather and because they had no flight attendants. Had to spend the night and they did not help me with a hotel or transportation or a meal. Total out of pocket was $180. Today I am back at the airport and my flight is again delayed because the crew is somewhere else. I’m not even going to my original Airport. There are Delta flights that would get me where I need to go but American won’t rebook me on one. This American trip has been a disaster.
728,"  Minneapolis to Phoenix. Awful, the back of the plane smelled of fume. It snowed so we were delayed for four hours and the flight did not have any food. All they had were pretzels and cookies. The plane was super hot as well and the ac fan on top of my head barely blew any air out. I was starving by the time I got to Phoenix but could not get anything to eat either because I was rushing to my next flight."
729,"Not Verified |  My flight got delayed because of a reroute due to weather. Then it was delayed 5 more times (and the weather was only in one state which was behind us-the weather ahead is good). The last delay due to the plane needing repairs. Supposed to arrive at 8:50am, now hoping to land at 7:50pm. No accommodations. Have never had this problem with any other airlines."
730,Not Verified |  I will never fly American Airlines again. Every time I book with them my flight is cancelled. Tonight my flight was cancelled and their solution is to book me for a flight on Monday. That's 2 days after I am scheduled to arrive at my destination. I waited in line 2 hours for this solution and their solution is a cot in the airport. 
731,"  I’m from India, travelling to NY via Boston. My first flying experience with American Airlines. My flight has been delayed for 3 hours, but the lady at the counter was kind enough to assist me to see if I can get onto an earlier flight. I walk up to gate B20 of American Airline at Logan Boston Intl airport; and wait for 10 mins for these 2 airline staff to stop chit chatting at the gate. And when the chatter was unending I decided to excuse myself and ask for help. Me: “Excuse me Ma’am” The tall lady : barked back “ I’m not talking to you! Can’t you see we both talking! U better wait! Don’t you got no sense?!” Such poor reception, extremely rude!"
732,  After purchasing my ticket and they offered me extra insurance so that I can change my flight or cancel without penalty. After finding out that my business has concluded early I attempted to get on standby status. After finding out that I was plenty of seats available they informed me that because I have economy class ticket I could not change my ticket without a $200 charge. So basically I purchased the extra insurance and wasted my money. I will never fly American again.
733,"  Atlanta to Los Angeles. We chose American Airlines because of the comfort and entertainment provided. We paid higher prices than with other airlines for the amenities. However, our flight was changed with no explanation other than it being cancelled. We had to rearrange everything. Then the new flight was a one stop (which we hate) the reason we paid more for non stop. Then there was no entertainment on either flights. 6 hours to the east coast, it sucked! We were so disappointed that we didn't take our return flight back on American. We paid for non stop on another airline since we received nothing we originally wanted with American."
734,"  Gulfport to Dallas. The plane was less than 50% booked. The flight attendants allow people to move seats as they like backwards and forewords throughout the plane so the will not have to sit next to another passenger. I was unable to sit in any exit row, all of which were empty. “You have to pay for those seats.” You also have to pay to sit further up in the plane instead of the back where I was. So I cannot move to a paid seat but others can? What is the purpose of this? Yes, normally you would have to pay extra to sit in an exit row. Since absolutely no one paid to sit there because the flight was more than half empty what is the issue with sitting there? If I had paid for a ticket and not picked a seat, if it was the only seat left I would not have to pay more for the flight, they would automatically put me in the exit row. Not like it hasn’t happened several times already. I fly often for work. Thanks for nothing American Airlines. Next time I’ll drive."
735,"Not Verified |  American Airlines states they’re “Going for Great” when they are far from it. After my husbands graduation ceremony dates for the Air force changed a few months after purchasing our tickets, they refused to change the tickets to one day prior, even when I offered to pay extra if necessary. They told me all I could do was void my ticket and buy a new one. I asked if they do anything for active duty military and basically came out and said NO.  So now I’m left scrambling trying to make other arrangements so I can be there."
736,"  San Diego to Puerto Vallarta via Phoenix. They had a glitch in their system that made my TSA Pre-check not showed up on my boarding pass. So I got sent back to a very, very long line. After getting through TSA I still had more than 10 mins before departure, and the gate agent literally didn’t want to turn the door handle to let me in and told him this is because of the missing Pre-Check and he told me “it does that sometimes.”   Anyway after discussing some options with him or a few minutes, two other agents came out. Then after departure time, the plane didn’t even budge. I went back out to the check in kiosks and the agent was able to put Pre-check on my new pass. The AA agents I encountered gave me attitude for their mistakes. They lied about the situation and tried to make me think this is my fault. I would board my flight, with time to spare, if it wasn’t for their glitchy ticketing system."
737,"Not Verified |  Wilmington to Los Angeles. My daughter missed her flight this morning in Wilmington NC because security too 47 minutes to assist 4 Handicapped adults through security. Now she has been in Charlotte for 7 hours waiting standby. She suffers from anxiety, the airports fault she missed her flight!! Now American is saying no availability until tomorrow morning."
738,Not Verified | It took 10 hours to get me from Santa Rosa to Santa Ana on a 423$ ticket. Alaska Airlines on time. American cancels and delays flights so you are packed in hours later like sardines with zero empathy. This is the psychopath of all air travel! Never ever again!
739,"  Minneapolis to Dallas. Solid customer service. Food not great, but it's airline food. Good website and check-in process. Flights were on time, and the planes were clean. Good selection of movies on the individual screens"
740,"  This awful experience is happening too Often with American Airlines. Passengers have to wait for about 3 hours or more for maintenance issues. What’s going on with customer service and great experience? Why is maintenance happening after passengers are already on board? Straight flight to Bogota, Colombia from Dallas was scheduled at 5:50 pm. Its being delayed 5 times already. It’s 8/04 and still waiting. Who is responsible for this poor customer service? The same exact situation occurred on March 10th to my daughter and grandson with the same flight"
741," Palm Springs to Chicago. Worst airline ever, they made us wait on the plane for a extra 30 minutes so we missed our flight. We went to the rebooking place and they said they cant give us anything! No rental car. And no hotel vouchers. Absolutely unbelievable. Now we have to wait at the Chicago airport for 11 hours to catch the next flight. Do not fly with American Airlines."
742, Customer service isn’t about how bad you mess up it’s about how you fix it - well American Airlines can screw up big and then make it worse. probably the same old story most travelers have gone through at some point but in the end the luggage was in the back literally a wall away from us and they refused to get it. The people they screwed with the delays did not take precedence over people that booked much later. The list could go on. Long story short if you need to fly don’t use them unless you must. If they are cheaper you get what you pay for.
743,"  Our flight from Oklahoma City to Dallas delayed 2 hrs. Our flight from Dallas delayed multiple times (still here). Now it looks like we are going to miss next flight also. My company purchased our tickets with American Airlines. I have always flown southwest or Delta and never experienced delays more than 5 minutes. Not a weather problem; it’s April and weather is good! Seriously, this is bad business."
744," New York to Chicago. This airline will treat you worse than an animal. After a 2h delay, we are “parked” in the plane and waiting to depart. No information is being communicated, no food/water is being distributed. Below minimum human standards! They also wouldn’t accept volunteers who were ready to give up their seats for other passengers to fly - worst customer support ever. They also claimed that WiFi for entertainment was available on this flight, it is not."
745,  Dallas Fort Worth to Milwaukee. My gate was changed 4 times in an hour and a half America Airlines team members were rude and dismissive of my family and 8 other travelers. At the gate desk they then told me to go complain at the information desk but it wouldn’t help America Airlines is indifferent to customer service This was reiterated to me by 2 AA captains  and ground staff. The steward took blankets away from my 85 year old mother when I asked for some more she came back and threw them at me after telling me she didn’t appreciate me telling the captain that I gave my mother a 83 year old grandmother my mother’s wheelchair and that she had been in airport 12 hours. I told stewardess I don’t appreciate her customer service and attitude while watching other passengers jaw drop at her aggressive and unprofessional behavior. There was another great steward aboard that tried to my my Birthday flight home better.
746,"  Savannah to Dallas. We arrived at the airport 2.5 hrs early to get checked in. I travelled with my 80 year old mother who lives in a different state than me, and who does not know how to use the kiosk. There were 3 ladies behind the check in counter huddled up talking and giggling like school girls. We stepped to the counter and asked to be checked in. A rude woman said, did you try the kiosks?! I stated, ""No. My mother is 80 years old and does not know how to use them, so we would like to check in here"". She gave us a bad attitude while her friends still stood there doing nothing to help other passengers, by maybe calling them over to their empty check in stations. There used to be something we called ""customer service"". Apparently, American Airlines would rather pay staff to stand around and *watch customers use the kiosk*, rather than offer assistance to elderly passengers, who remember the days of checking in at the counter with a live friendly agent, not an robot?! I was furious my mother was treated this way. To top it off, they also put us in separate seating rows at checkin, yet when I booked our tickets, I had chosen seats together online. I had to have another agent at the gate correct the seating arrangement, where we were then sat in the very back row against the toilet walls where seats did not recline, not the prechosen seats we paid for and were ticketed to sit in on our reservations."
747,  Detroit to Chicago. As I sit on the tarmac for an hour because of a weather delay in Chicago I felt a need to say how kind and compassionate our flight attendants have been. I wish all my flights have been this good. Now let’s hope we make it to Chicago on time for my connection
748," Chicago to New York. Having read the relentless negative reviews on American Airlines on this forum, I was wary of flying with them. However, I found my experience exceptionally satisfying. On this Saturday afternoon flight, I was upgraded to a business class seat which was spacious and comfortable. It did lack personal entertainment system on the back of the seat in front of you; instead you had the drop down from the ceiling screen where the safety video was played and a show screened which I did not bother. Rather outdated system. Fifteen of the 16 seats in the cabin were occupied and serviced by two very attentive attendants. Pre-take off drinks, bowl of warm nuts, a hot towel, a full dinner with a vegetarian option - I had the beef with mashed potatoes — and a good selection of alcoholic drinks made the smooth flight in a clean and bright cabin go very quickly. Pilot provided just the right amount of information in an amiable manner including letting us know that a cat was a passenger on the flight in the cargo hold. To top it all, the flight arrived at the gate several minutes ahead of schedule. One could not ask more. Good job, American!"
749,  Dallas to Charlotte. My flight was delayed because “they didn’t have a plane”. The delay was only explained that way. I missed my connection and have to fly out the next day. I will miss a very important meeting as a result. They offered no accommodations for there screw up. I will try to avoid flying them in the future
750,"  Pay close attention to the type of ticket you purchase or you will be penalized. I bought a ticket from a third party online, Cheap-o-Air, to attend my sister's funeral. I thought it was strange that they didn't give me a seat assignment. Then a window popped up, telling me that if I wanted to pick my seats, it would cost an additional $25 per seat for the 4 flights, an extra $100 cost. I called the airlines to find out if my flight was confirmed, since I didn't have a seat assignment. They said yes. Then, a few days later, I needed to make a change, so I called the airlines to see if I could fly stand by on an earlier flight. They told me that my ticket was a Basic Economy ticket, which means no changes, no seat assignment, no carry ons, and I must board last. Wow! Talk about treating me like dirt. I honestly do not recall seeing any of these restrictions listed when I booked the ticket. And they didn't care that I had extenuating circumstances, a close family member's funeral. I had not encountered such punitive measures before. Maybe that's because I usually fly JetBlue. In the future, I will rent a car or take the train before I fly American."
751,"Not Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Jacksonville. Trying to join friends for a weekend of golf and fun at Sea Island. So we booked the 10:50 from Dallas to JAX in first class. When we arrive at gate C30, I see the worst possible thing, a Super 80 at our gate. Perhaps the worst passenger airline plane of all times. For some reason, American can not rid itself of these dinosaurs. At 10:45 they tell us there is a problem with the 30+ year old plane. The part will arrive in 10 minutes and it will take 20 minutes to install. Then after numerous departure update texts, they send us down to gate C19 changing to another Super 80. We finally board and while waiting for fuel and catering, the crew times out, seriously! They deplaned all passengers while we wait for the replacement crew. The new crew arrives check out the plane and we board. We finally leave the gate at 2:45. Taxi out to the runway and while waiting to take off the captain announces that we must return to the gate because there is a problem with the navigation system. So here we sit at the gate waiting for maintenance (an interesting name for this airline). They are offering us to leave now because we have been at this so long. Passengers are laughing at this announcement to keep from crying. We will see how this goes now. At least the gate agent brought food and drinks while we were between crews-cudos to him. You really cannot make this stuff up. 3:25 now. Another safety demo too!"
752,"  Sacramento to Mazatlán via Phoenix. First leg delayed, second automatically rescheduled a day later. This is a 4 day trip, now a 3 day trip. I’m told there is no other way to get me to MZT, that if I go home and try again tomorrow I’m out of pocket for the RT Lyft (c.$50) and if I go to Phoenix, I may have to pay for my own hotel and seek reimbursement! Last business trip, AA stranded me in O’Hare for 8 hours. No food voucher, no lounge access, no upgrade, no nothing. American is awful."
753,  Charlotte to Orlando. My flight was to leave at 1030am in it got delayed over time I stop counting. I didn't get leave the first airport until 6pm at night my seat was taken that i paid for in was told i would have to buy a upgrade if to get it back. The staff was very rude when talking to them especially on the second part of the flight in North Carolina. I didn't get to my destination until almost 11pm at night was place in middle seat after my aisle was taken from me in was told I would have to pay a extra 50 dollars when there was lots of empty seat on the flight. This was the worst experience I have ever been on. I will never use this airline again they have drop off service
754,"  Chicago to Las Vegas. I booked a round-trip flight (as I do every year with American) from Chicago -> Las Vegas for the opening weekend of March Madness. My return flight was 8am on Monday March 25th. Right before boarding, the representative mentioned we would have a 15minute delay. Ok, not a big deal, this is typical with large airlines. 15 minutes later the representative then told us ""We're sorry, this flight has not been cancelled. Please call AA.com to choose a different flight at no extra charge."" As you would expect, all of the other flights out of Las Vegas on American were the next day. They wanted to switch my flight from Monday at 8am to Tuesday at 10am with a layover in Phoenix, arriving in Chicago at 10pm. (36 hours later ""free""). I called American Airlines and told them this was unacceptable and needed to be switched to a different airline since I had to work the next day. They said I could book through a separate airline and request a reimbursement. I chose to fly on a Delta flight that got me home around 11pm on Monday (8 hours after my original plans, not a huge issue). I then requested a reimbursement through American and they said ""We're sorry, if a flight is cancelled, please use a representative and we'll switch you to a new flight. Since you booked yourself, we cannot reimburse you."" I did exactly what they said and am now $600 out-of-pocket for a 1-way flight. I will never  use American airlines again. I was a once Platinum Pro member with them, but this is a new low to me. Avoid at all costs. Delta and Southwest are significantly better. I will pay $50+ more for a flight that is not American moving forward. Hope this helps save someone a future headache."
755,"  San Jose to Chicago via Charlotte. Terribly disorganized. Overbooked several flights and had people panicking. They gave my friend someone else’s ticket with his information on it. They gave myself and another person the same seat, then kicked me out because they said I didn’t have priority. They were rude over the loudspeaker and nagged us the entire flight about seatbelts, turning our phones off and giving their pens back after borrowing them for customs forms. We felt like cattle being herded not like paying customers. Food was also less than average. My animals are fed better. I will be avoiding AA in the future even if it means paying more."
756,"  Boston to Tucson. The worst flight. First our scheduled trip from Boston to Dallas to Tucson was changed to Boston to Los Angeles to Tucson. The seating was inexcusable, absolutely no room. Why make people so cramped and uncomfortable. Even the stewardess mentioned that the bathrooms had gotten so small if you go in the wrong way you cant turn around. The newer plane had tiny air vents that produced virtually no air, its was way too hot and there was no way to get fresh air. Mst planes have actual cool air that you can feel. Got to LA and next flight was delayed. Unfortunately have to return on AA but will never fly again using American."
757,  Boston to Chicago. Terrible service. Forced to check in my bags because I was told there was no overhead space. What’s the point of selling carry on tickets to economy group only to be forced to check in bag. On the flight From Philadelphia to Boston had a bad experience with some air hostess harassing me because of putting my suitcase in the overhead bin. If you have a choice don’t choose American Airlines.
758,"  Baltimore to Austin. I am again disappointed with American Airlines. While waiting for my plane I heard that the plane before us was having maintenance problems and could not take off for at least three hours. Then they were rerouting customers and changed our gate. I went to my new gate and learned that my flight was delayed as well and I was not able to make my connecting flight. Again it was because of maintenance problems on the plane. Is there no one checking these flights before they’re pulled up to the gate? American Airlines continues to go downhill and has been doing so for years. I am now connecting a flight in Dallas Fort Worth And was just informed that that flight as well is delayed! How can this happen on such an established airline? The planes are in disrepair. People are angry and service people have the attitude of “oh well” American Airlines is fast becoming a joke, it is a wonder that they are still viable. I have been a loyal member but I am fast turning my sites to Southwest who has a superior service reputation all around."
759," Charlotte to Las Vegas. American Airlines is the worlds worst airline company. I had the worst experience of my life. I held in the airport from 5am to 2pm. We got on a flight only to be sitting there for 20 min before taken off for maintenance issues on a plane that was supposedly sitting overnight. Why would you not have your mechanics looking at the plane prior to boarding time? The the flight was suppose to leave at 7:30 am only to be sent to another gate to board another flight only to be told 5 different boarding times and 2 hours later that that plane had mechanical issues as well. We were told it was due to maintenance and unable to fix. We did not board our flight until 1:30pm. How do you sell tickets without proper working planes? I also purchased an upgraded seat for the first flight, which I never sit in. What a waste! I had to miss 2 business meetings. Customer relations is refusing to set me up with their manager telling me they don't have one. American Airline you need to really do better. This is not the way you conduct business, especially when your dealing with my time and money. You really need to get yall act together and give your employees a proper training. The attitude that your staff have is so unprofessional. The sad apart American Airlines you do nothing to make sure your customers are feeling at ease after all the issues that you cause. I am very disappointed in your company."
760,  Again with American it is a continuous fight to keep your luggage as a carry on. After fighting for it on three other flighs the final leg they got me. Only to discover on the plane they had empyt bins all around. I demand for my luggage and they tell me once it’s tag the law states they cannot give me my stuff back. How about american airline stops taking luggage from their customers or start making a checked bag free to eliminate the carry ons. I will be sure to never go on American again. The airline has no customer service care and creates a hostile environment for people with carry on luggage. Two years ago this airline did the same thing trying to grab luggage out of my 8 year olds hands. They have no personal space or care and will take your stuff. Beware.
761,  Phoenix to Los Angeles. Booked ticket 2 months ago. Got to airport 3 hrs early and were told that they could not seat us together unless we paid $25 extra. That is a scam or extortion take your pick.
762,"  Disappointed From Miami to Guatemala. I've never been too satisfied with my flights with American Airlines and also this was not a good flight, even if the airplanes we used was quite new and the pitch was quite resonable. The flight looked as it was carried out by a low cost airlines: food on purchase and with no IFE (it was expected to have a Personal Device Entertainment, but it was no working even if I've got the app downloaded before the take off)"
763,"  San Jose to Miami. Not so bad From San José de Costa Rica to Miami. I have never been too satisfied with my flights with American Airlines, but that time I was partly surprised. It still to be a no frills flight with food on purchase, but that time the IFE was working. It was a Personal Device Entertainment so you can watch free movies and TV shows right from your personal device if you had downloaded on your device before your flight the AA app. I really appreciated this service."
764,"  A flight to forget. From Milan to Miami. Unfortunately, American Airlines still  using old aircraft on the routes between the US and Milan. My aircraft was not only old and in not good conditions, with an old-fashioned IFE system (overhead TV, no power), but it also had old and ruined seats. My seat was tilted outwards and it was not possible to change seats because the plane was full. The flight staff was quite good, but not always attentive to passenger needs as in others airlines. Poor quality food and beverage compared to those usually offered on transoceanic flights by European or Middle Eastern and Asian airlines. By the end, that 12h flight was an experience to forget, also because the ticket price was definitely overpriced compared to the services that AA was offering"
765,"  San Antonio to Dallas. 4th time flying with American. Also 4th time they’ve cancelled flights on me. Every time I fly with them there are delays and cancellations. Additionally, there are never enough support people to help and they’re always sorry for the problems. I feel bad for them but someone in management needs to be held accountable. If you fly, use any other airline. American seem to take no pride in making the customer experience a positive one"
766,  We recently flew Detroit to Philadelphia return and both flights the airline stated that only 25 passengers would be allowed their carryon bags. All others would be checked. My husband had a heart attack not long ago and had all his medicine. They refused to allow him his bag stating that we had to take his meds out and put them in a bag on our lap. This happened on both flights. When we boarded the plane there were many overhead bins with room for carry on bags. This is misleading as they sell their tickets as you can have a carryon and a bag. Then the attendants were very rude. Very disappointed in this airline.
767,"Not Verified |  My family traveled to New Zealand recently, and I cannot say enough good things about our experience with American. Long haul with a 5 year old is not something that I look forward to, but the American Airlines crew and ground staff were so warm and kind to our family. I was very impressed with the international flight’s in seat features like entertainment, cell phone charging . Meals were great and the snacks were a welcome reprieve. I travel like Guinness - not well - and i dread the bumpy landings and descent to Denver. I must compliment the pilot of our flight into DIA yesterday for the most gentle landing and descent I’ve had to date. My son was so excited for his first international trip, and the people at American made it so very special for him. Thank you all for all that you do!"
768," American Airlines is the worlds worst airline company. I had the worst experience of my life. My wife and I were held in the airport from 4pm until 1am. We got on a flight only to be taken back to the gate for maintenance issues on a flight that was already delayed. Then the flight was delayed 7 times (it was clear we weren't going anywhere) 6.45 to 7.00, then 7.45 to 9.20, then 10.00 then 10.30 then 1.15, then nowhere. We were told it was due to maintenance and not having a crew. How do you sell tickets without having a crew? We also were told we can't take our bags and that they would be on a flight that we were practically forced to take the next day into Manchester, NH. Sure enough the bags were never on that flight. I had to miss work the following day in order to make sure I got my bags. Customer relations is refusing to set me up with their manager telling me they don't have one. I promise on everything I love I will never fly American Airlines again, I will make sure my family and everyone I talk to doesn't step foot on an American Airlines plane. The planes are gross and outdated and missing upholstery, no TV's just won't make for a good day and possible could delay your plans. I had to miss work and a wedding because of them. "
769,"  Miami to Freeport. A few months back AA upgraded my status to Platinum for 3 months and I was able to get the free upgrade to business on this 45 minute flight. Needless to mention that the only business experience you can get on such flight is the pre takeoff beverage and a snack. The seat was nice and comfortable, the aircraft look and felt brand new and I got to work with no major hassles. Thank you AA, now if you could also fly out of ACY and give Spirit a run for their money that would be awesome!"
770,"  Philadelphia to Miami. This was an early flight to get to work, AA had recently sent me an email that they would upgrade my status to Platinum for 3 months so that I could experience the benefits of it. On this flight I did not make it for the business class upgrade, I believe I was like 10 on the list, however I got a seat with more leg room for no extra cost. I got to Miami from Philadelphia with no issues, the plane was clean and the crew professional. Good job AA!"
771,"Not Verified |  Kansas City to Philadelphia. I honestly wouldn’t fly American if they didn’t go everywhere I have to go. They are over priced for what you get. They are just as bad as Spirit as they charge you for seats. How dare you! What am I suppose to do, stand? If you’re not first class they make you feel like nothing. Thanks. Delta, Southwest, Virgin, JetBlue are so much better! These are my last flights on this airline."
772," Have not flown American Airlines in the past however, did connect thru Philadelphia Airport on a US Air flight 10 years ago. We left Minneapolis no issues, smaller plane. Landed in Philadelphia with plenty of time for our connection to Rome. Airport incredibly hot but that is not the airlines issue. Plane boarded fine (love with they put up sign queues for those who hang out in front of the gate). Plane was pushed back and proceeded to sit on the tarmac for over 3 hours waiting for our assigned place and then de-icing. Pilot was becoming irritated as apparently he could not turn on the ventilation (why I don't understand) and finally came on the intercom stating that the airport has run out of de-icing fuel. I guess they had to run to the store to buy more. In any case, our connection now in Rome is screwed but I don't blame American for that. I find fault with the initial flight crew who never once in those 3 hours made themselves known. When right before take off they came out with water and proceeded to serve the first 3 rows never to be seen again until food service (hour later). Not sure if they were new or what. When asked if they had milk to help settle my stomach the flight attendant said yes she'd be right back (never saw her again). We were towards the front of the cabin, not sure who was getting service here. I have been on many many international flights, so many lost opportunities to show better service. Not once during the overnight flight did they come around with water. No wake up towels (which are a really nice treat on some flights). Basically it was like no one was there. The only redeeming point was that upon landing a flight crew guy got all of us (7) to our connecting gate in time to board from Rome to Tel Aviv. Of course our bags never made it. Overall very disappointing picture of this airlines, and I guess $1000 is nothing to some service industries."
773," I’m sitting on this flight now. This is the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. They got delayed while on the plane. With no explanation whatsoever. Staff are extremely rude. There is no power supply and my daughter who is two years old is getting restless. I will miss my bus and have to wait additional time because I am still sitting on the ground. This is my first time and last time using American Airlines. Also, I had to pay for my two year old who they wouldn’t let me sit her on my lap. So far while writing this, 1 hour and a half. Terrible. "
774,"  Tampa to Philadelphia. Horrible experience. Flight overbooked, forced everyone with a carry on to become checked bag. Pilot said 15’minutes remain, ended up being 45. Once we got off the plane, checked bags were sent to wrong pickup location."
775,  Orlando to Miami. Rude completely unhelpful at desk. Almost missed flight. Then disrespectful again when another passenger cut the line for the second time. Bet if I was a man or traveling with one he wouldn’t have snapped at me. Worst flight experience ever. Won’t be returning!
776,"  American Airlines squeezes every cent of profit out at expense of customers and employees. My roundtrip has been nothing but delays and cancellations. I was stranded in SFO overnight after flight was bumped 10 hours because AA ""ran out of room vouchers"". I have to now wait 12 hours in Charlotte to take my final one-hour flight leg. I can drive faster than that by 8 hours! Even the supervisor in charge of the 2 employees at the ticketing desk last night said to complain to the airline because their policies are making it hell on employees too!"
777,"Not Verified |  Phoenix to Minneapolis. Worst customer service ever. Was traveling this evening (see picture - no one was allowed into the check in area despite no line). Stood next in line to check in bag for 40 minutes and was 3 minutes late to check my bag and told I couldn’t board my flight. When I asked for an explanation, one was not given. I was put on a standby flight with no guarantees seat for the following day again with no explanation. The lady helping me laughed when I walked away - clearly this was a joke to her. Now I’m stuck without a reservation despite paying for a ticket and waiting NEXT IN LINE for 40 minutes. Will never fly American again. Highly recommend flying southwest. American air lines at Phoenix sky harbor ALWAYS has customer service issues. Do not support this airline."
778,  Charlotte to Tampa. I was on flight 1773 and my seat was 18B. We had not taken off yet and I had a seizure. It was the first seizure I had in a year. The staff was great and the people around me were great. The steward in particular that stands out whose name I did not get because we just boarded and it was so crazy. He was so amazing and patient and helpful. He got all my stuff for me and made me feel comfortable during my seizure. I wasn’t rushed off the plane or felt embarrassed. The staff and other customers on the flight were so understanding and great. The flight was already delayed and my situation was making it worse and everyone was really great with me. Thank you and please tell that flight attendant from the bottom of my heart thank you!
779,"  Dallas to Lexington. I would recommend paying a little more money to fly with someone else. I’ve had problems every time I’ve flown with American and this past time has been a nightmare. First they do a surprise landing somewhere else, making all of us miss our other flights. They wouldn’t let me on my next one until I argued with them for a while and after they let me and others on they take us all the way to a 30 min take off spot only to take us back bc they decide to cancel it. Had to stay the night in the airport and was supposed to take off on another flight at 12, but only to have them have us get off bc technical issues. They get us another plane, we board, and they tell us to get off again bc technical. They obviously don’t care about their customers bc they won’t pay attention or do anything for wasting 2 days of our lives."
780,  Grand Cayman to Denver via Charlotte. I have not flown with this airline for 15+ years. Now I remember why. The absolute worst service in the industry not to mention targeting passengers. Completely incompetent employees in ticketing with no communication to outbound passengers was the beginning almost causing us to miss our flight. Then there was no food service or even the ability to purchase food on an international lunchtime flight not to mention the trash talking by the flight attendants during the flight. Make sure you do not question them because they will target passengers and force you to check your carry on luggage because of a “size” issue even though other passengers with a later boarding group and LARGER luggage were allowed to board no problem. What a disgusting level of service. Never again. Save yourself the problems and spend more to ensure this doesn’t happen to you.
781," We booked a round-trip fare for direct flights. When we were leaving Eagle airport we were told we had to stop in Denver to get fuel. How ridiculous to send a plane with not enough fuel. We were not offered a beverage or any food for free and got home over 2.5 hours late. No explanation or apology. The flight attendant, he said either we land in Denver or we have to let a third of the passengers off and he said it happens all the time if the flight is full. Why book a full plane then. We suffered and the airline benefited. Last time I’ll fly American. Four of us in our family. All unhappy!"
782,  Pittsburgh to Phoenix. Horrible customer service. Due to business I called in to move a flight back willing to pay as I have always done with Southwest Airlines. American was unable to accommodate me in any matter and advised me to buy another round trip ticket as my entire trip would be a total loss. There was no credit or any type of refund offered and on top of that they were the rudest people I have spoken to.
783," Cancun to Omaha via Miami. Absolutely dreadful experience. A nightmare. Flight delayed 5 times without any explanation, stuck in the airport for 6 hours, spent 80$ on food and internet to let family know. On arrival in Miami they throw us on the street without explanation how to get to shuttle to Holiday Inn hotel in the middle of the night. I was forced to take another flight to Chicago, arrive to Omaha a day later, miss my work. I didn’t pay for this. I paid for 5 hours 52 min flight with one connection. It was cattle treatment at the airport. I truly hope they go out of business."
784," I was traveling with my wife and two sons from Dallas to Phoenix via El Paso. I had a boarding pass in hand as I went through the long (25-30 min) security line at DFW. When we arrived at the security desk, the TSA officer scanned my boarding pass and told me it was ""invalid."" We then tried to scan it from my wife's smart phone in case it was a printer error. Still invalid. I was told to exit the security line and go to an AA kiosk to print another boarding pass. Well, the reserved seat with my name on it was no longer available, so I was forced to make another seat selection. In addition, I was forced to pay an extra $6-7 for the seat. Since I really wanted to join my family for our spring break vacation, and did not wish to miss my flight, I went ahead and bought the new seat. Fortunately the TSA officer allowed me back to the front of the line and I was able to join my family in the terminal, narrowly making the flight. The whole thing seemed like an outrage, even by AA's deplorable standards. Since this is a long review I will spare additional complaints about the long delay de-boarding the flight, the rude AA gate personnel who pretended not to notice my teenaged son while he waited to ask them a question, the long delay getting gate checked bags, etc.. Just awful."
785,"  Dayton to San Diego. I have never been treated so rudely. I have been a Delta flyer for years and I know why. I was flying to San Diego for an important business meeting I arrived at the airport 47 minutes before the flight by the time they were to weigh and load my bags there was 41 minutes until departure, they stopped mid check in and said oh you’ve missed the 45 minute minimum. I said I fly out of this airport all the time and this is my routine. I’ve never heard of such a thing and never missed a flight. Long story short they were less than helpful and suggested I go to the delta desk which I did. I had to book another round trip fair at $2000 just to get to my meeting. The Delta people were very helpful and said they have a 30 minute cut off and so did the rest of the airlines apparently not American. Horrible horrible customer service and poor manners. Never no matter the cost difference will I fly American."
786,  St. Louis to Dallas via Tampa. They never let me know my flight changed. The people at the desk were rude and unhelpful. Now i will miss a very important business meeting because I can't get a flight until the morning. I will never catch an American Airlines flight again.
787," Left Cleveland for Dallas on time, when we arrived to Dallas flight was delayed 2 hours then delayed another 3 hours. American Airlines were really great about trying to make customers happy. They offered rooms for customers who didn’t want to wait and had food and drinks at the gate complimentary. I have flown for years and American is my choice of airline. These things happen and we all know the risk when traveling."
788,"  Oklahoma City to Tampa. It is very frustrating that the majority of flyers take on 2 and even 3 carry on items. Most of them are large and need to be checked. We check our bags everytime we fly and are charged 25 bucks per bag. But, the people that don't check their bags and are forced to check them at the plane don't get charged a dime. There was a girl on our flight 3 days ago that carried on a duffle bag that was bigger than her. It didn't fit in the overhead compartment and it didn't fit under her seat. She had her feet on top of it the entire flight and no one said anything to her. All of this ""not checking bags"" also holds up the entire plane and with short connection times we have made very close calls of almost missing our connecting flights. This is a very frustrating and unfair system that needs to be taken care of immediately."
789,"  I flew with American Airlines from Manchester, UK to Philadelphia. I didn’t find the flight crew rude, however my mom sitting next to me said the man serving food was grumpy. While I didn’t find him especially friendly I didn’t think he was rude. The food was below average. The inflight entertainment didn’t have the biggest selection of films although I did find something to watch. This isn’t the worst airline experience I’ve had but far from the best."
790,"  Absolutely horrible airline. Flew from Cleveland to philly to Punta Cana, got a 5 hour delay to Punta Cana ended up getting to our resort at 8 at night. On way home we landed at 9 o clock they held us on plane till 10 and missed our flight home which was at 10:15 and wouldn’t even accommodate us to a hotel room for the night told us it wasn’t there fault we got held on the plane for an extra hour after landing had to spend an extra 130$ for a hotel room. "
791,"  New York JFK to Sao Paulo and back in business class was a flawless flight. AA's lounges on both ends have been renovated, while they won't win design awards, they are spacious and comfortable. At JFK, there is actually real champagne (let's hope that won't be cost reduced); at GRU, it's a Brazilian sparkler, surprisingly drinkable. Hot food at both ends looked dubious, the cold stuff was upscale deli quality but varied and tasty enough to make for a pleasant light supper. Boarding both times was smooth, the flight attendants were personable and caring, AA's much reviewed C seat is really spacious and confortable. I slept soundly, both ways practically from wheels up to final descent. Flights arrived a little early both times. What more can you ask for?"
792,"  Tampa to Charlotte. Absolute worst airline. Had to take emergency military leave to attend my grandfathers funeral. Was told by employee on the phone to buy a later in day ticket to save money and was assured multiple times that my ticket was available to be put on stand by for earlier flights. Arrived at TPA, only to be told by multiple employees that it wasnt eligible to be placed on stand by. So yes I know this is partly on myself for being ignorant enough to buy a later ticket. However, due to the dishonesty on the part of the sales representative and refusal to listen by the airport employees I missed my own grandfathers funeral. Really appreciate that AA. If I could give you a negative 10, I would."
793,"Not Verified |  I had a flight leaving out of Washington DC to go to Arizona (layover) then to California. My flight leaving from DC was at 7:01, we board the plane and then after an hour of sitting, the plane tells us to get off due to technical issues. I believe it was either smoking and there was an issue with the hydraulic system. So our flight departure time got pushed back to 9, then to 10, then. 12. And at 12 they said they would let us know if we could board the plane. 12 o’clock came, they said no, then pushed departure back to 2. Once two o’clock came, we no longer had a pilot or a flight crew. So we now have to wait for a flight crew. Pushed out time back to 3:30 then to 3:55. FINALLY we board and take off to Pheonix, AZ. I had to reschedule my layover flight now to arrive in California at 10pm, when originally I should’ve been to California by 12pm. My layover flight at AZ departure time is 8:37pm. We board the plane, and then get a text message (with their updates) that the flight gate has changed. They make an announcement after finish letting us board to say the plane is out of service we will be going to another plane. Now push back time is 9:00pm. I have been dealing with American Airlines literally all day, and I have never experienced anything like this before in my life. I will not be using them again. Did you not know the plane was going to be out of service."
794,  Raleigh Durham to Dallas Ft Worth. Terrible. It was round-trip both flights was delayed and don’t have space for cabin bag. Seriously this not acceptable everyone have their own time they shouldn’t ruin it. I am so disappointed.
795,"Not Verified |  Absolute worst airline I’ve ever flown with. I currently travel around twice per month with Delta for work, but had to take American Airlines for my honeymoon. Everyone from the baggage check worker to the gate workers were extremely rude. They overbooked my flight and told me that I had to check my carry-on due to size, even though I currently travel with this bag every other week without every encountering any issues. When I got on the plane, I witnessed them tell the lady in front of me that she was upgraded to first class, only to tell her she had to go back to her original seat when she got up to the front with her bag! This is a joke of an airline and I will never be flying with them again."
796,"  Kona to Phoenix. Awful experience on an aging, dirty poorly equipped plane. Seat had almost no room, very narrow. The legroom even though I paid for extra was awful and inadequate. The graphic showed when you select your seat was inaccurate and did not represent the leg room available on the plane. I got no satisfaction when I complained to AA. I'm even an AA Advantage credit card member, have a frequent flyer account as well and that meant nothing to them. "
797," Charlotte to Boston. Was supposed to leave at 10:20 pm, got postponed three times without any information. I was traveling with my kids one is 4 years old and the other 6 months old, we did not start boarding till after midnight and the staff were very rude and evasive when you ask for information. This airline is getting much worse, this is not my first bad experience, I am considering even canceling the credit card I have with American Airlines, not interested in their miles, very disappointed and frustrated. That leg of the trip just ruined all the fun we had on our vacation."
798,"Not Verified |  Gulfport to Dallas. I am sitting at the airport with another delayed flight. It has become way more normal for a flight delay than on time. Particularly with AA! Our flight is now 7 hours past due and still isn’t here. Also, they are not giving us updates. It is 10 minutes past the last updated departure time and no news at all. I recommend flying with anyone but AA. The “savings” isn’t worth it when you have to plan a full day early to allow for repeated delays. I’m done with American Airlines."
799," Ruined my vacation! Flight to Jacksonville delayed, rerouted to DC with a connection flight to Jacksonville. This flight delayed for 2 hours, arriving 15 minutes before my cruise was scheduled to leave, sat on the tarmac for an additional 15 mins while the pilot informed us ""short staffed, no one to guide the plane to the airport."" Really didn't matter that I arrived just in time to miss my cruise because my luggage arrived 3 hours later on a plane from Dallas. The response from this horrible airline? I received an email saying they were sorry that my travel plans didn't work out, but since I purchased an economy class tickets, there are no refunds. My vacation plans were going just fine until they ruined them. A year planning the ultimate vacation, all that time and money lost due to this heartless joke of an airline! "
800,"Not Verified |  Thanks to American Airlines we were stuck here in South Korea they didn’t give us a ""solution"" like three hours ago. After they canceled our original flight this morning with just one stop, reasons ""maintenance"". Very bad experience with this airline. Our original itinerary was from Shanghai to Dallas and then Houston, and the canceled and I called them to fix the issue and the hang up on me after 45 minutes on the phone and the selected the flight for us and the send us via a China airlines from Shanghai to South Korea and then Dallas and all those flights they put us in separated seats with two minors (with is prohibited) and 9 years old and a 2 years old minors and when we ask the flight attended the didn’t want to help us we have to find the way to trade the seats. We ask for a upgrade or refund for our way back home and they never says anything and now we don’t have even our miles for our way back home from Shanghai to Houston. Completely disappointed with the treatment that we received."
801,"Not Verified |  Alabama to New York. The only reliable thing about this airline is that it consistently fails to get its passengers to the agreed location on time. I’ve flown with American Airlines 3 times over the last year and every time something causes a failure on the airlines part to get me to the destination I payed to travel. Also I bought a family members ticket and today they failed to get them to the local airport and I’m having to drive hours to get them. It’s been blamed on the weather, mechanical issues, even bad luck by the airline but in reality this airline is terrible. I tried calling and asking for some sort of reimbursement but the said I would have to email the airline and provide tons of documentation instead of a representative helping me after the airlines failed on 4 different occasions. This airline is absolutely horrible and I hope people read this and go to another airline because there’s a high probability this airline will fail you!"
802,"  Los Angeles to Chicago. There is too many seats in the airplane and no one have any space. Everyone is sitting and touching another person every time you want to move. The tables are dirty so as carpet in many places. I have no idea who have decided about Zoës kitchen food but I have tried turkey wrap which was soggy, wet with wet cheese inside and no taste on the way to LA and on the way back to Chicago I give them a 2nd chance and tried chicken sandwich which had hard ciabatta some kind of sauce that made ciabatta soggy inside."
803,  Oklahoma City to Tampa. The absolute worst airline. Customer service leaves a lot to be desired. I was transferred 4 times. I will never fly American again. The staff in customer service for Dallas airport was very belittling to me. So he cancelled my flight because I told him to go back home.
804," New York to Dallas. Every time I've flown through them, my flight has been delayed. We had a 1 pm EST flight from LGA to DFW, which was cancelled eventually after several delays due to mechanical issue. Then we were put on a 7 pm flight that also got delayed several times before departing at 8:15 pm. We arrived at DFW at 11 pm, 7 hours later than we were suppose to! No, we didn't get any voucher or anything for the delay. There were other airlines that were cheaper than American Airlines but I chose AA thinking we will fly in comfort because of the extra cost. I was very wrong! I am never flying on an AA again. Please do yourself a favor and avoid them if you can. They are not worth the extra money. Infact they were a lot worse in my experience compared to other cheaper airlines. I have flown to NYC from DFW and back several times before on other airlines and not once did I experience any kind of delays. I give them 0/10."
805,"  Austin to Durango via Dallas. Well we made our flight to Dallas barely on time. Then our flight was delayed but that was ok we were going to make it, we made it to our gate on time only to find that it was closed and people on standby were put ahead of us, even though we were expected to make our flight and we bought our tickets months in advance. Thank you American legal for the worst flight experience ever. The flight attendants were polite, but they couldn't do anything for us."
806,"  St. Thomas to Detroit via Philadelphia. Honestly, this airline provided me the worst experience as far as flying goes, I fly somewhere usually once or twice a year, and I’ve been traveling via air travel for as long as I can remember. I opted to take AA instead of Spirit because I wanted a middle of the road airline to avoid delays or issues. Every flight and connecting flight I rode on was delayed by hours, the last trip being the longest of the delays. AA provided us “free chips” instead of meal tickets as their apology for such a long delay. Unless you went to the front desk and complained to their staff, nothing else was offered or provided. I found out some customers were given extra miles or credit towards another ticket at the airport, so I decided to call AA customer service to try and get the same credit. Instead of receiving help, I was talking to an extremely rude “customer service” agent who at the end of our phone conversation was literally screaming and yelling at me and reduced me to tears of frustration. I spoke with a supervisor who apologized for her co workers behavior, but I was still offered no other help or credit. This airline is a joke, and you are way better off saving over 150 bucks per tickets and fly spirit or some other airline before you consider this one. At least when spirit delayed my flight they offered us meal tickets and partial credit towards another ticket. I never say this about a company, but I hope AA goes under because they are truly terrible. I feel bad for the cabin staff, because they were the only ones who were kind and supportive and they work for a bad company."
807,"Not Verified |  Knoxville to Charlotte. I was late (my fault) I tried to check in at the kiosk but it wouldn't let me, thinking i missed my flight. I asked the lady at the counter, she nodded her head as if i had missed it, she asked for my ID and started looking for another flight, then she called someone and asked if there were on time. She then turned to me and said start running to security so of course i did as i got to security i turned and she was right behind me, she got me through security and to the gate. (with 1 minute to spare). So as if it couldn't get any better as were both out of breath and i'm thanking her for everything she's done, she turns to go back to work and then she turns back to me, and says oh yeah your going to need this, and gives me the credit card I left at the ticket counter. Know all that being said its been a uphill battle to get her the recognition she deserves so let me help you."
808,"  St Thomas to Huntsville via Charlotte. I arrived at my gate on a 2 hour lay-over. Sat there all this time. They boarded the flight to Huntsville. Right before they closed the doors the agent called my name and just said to me “sorry we can’t get you on this flight.” He didn’t offer any explanation. He told me to stick around and he will see. So after I waited around he said the flight is closed, and that really upset me. First of all I had a paid ticket with an assigned seat. Second of all; there were no explanation as to what happened, and last that male agent was rude, packed his things and left 14 of us standing there like dogs. Yes, I starting telling them how unfair, poor, and ridiculous this is. Then a lady came over and gave us those sorry $260 comfort in hotel vouchers for the night. AA services sucks, they are big liars. I will not fly with AA. Their services have gone to the dogs."
809,"  San Antonio to Wichita via Dallas. I’m traveling with a service animal, not an emotional support animal or a therapeutic animal but a service animal. I’m also traveling with three small kids. We have been trying to leave Dallas since 3:12 pm central standard time. We have been moved around from gate to gate to gate. I have 8 different messages from you guys with different flight times. That is a long time for a service animal. She was starting to show signs she needed to go to the bathroom. They had moved us over to terminal C. I asked where the pet relief station was. I was told there are none in C. They are all located in A and D. They repeatedly failed to mention the one in B. Even then I wouldn’t have enough time to go to B and catch my flight. Before I flew I called and asked about flying with her and pet relief. I was advised in thermal C they would have someone escort me out and back in. The gate agents refused and said there is nothing they can do. I requested a supervisor. A guy name Kip, who did not introduce himself came over. The only reason I know his name is I asked someone else. I repeated what the gate agents said. I asked what am I expected to do when she goes to the bathroom. His reply was as an airlines that is not their responsibility’s i replied back how shitty American Airlines customer service is and how you guys are the worse airlines. He told me I didn’t need to us profanity, which I did not. He just stood there and I told him bye. He wasn’t helpfully so what was the point of having him stand there. He left and went over to a computer and started to type. They finally got ready to preboard. I was waiting in line and while he was typing he would repeatedly stair me down giving me a very dirty look. Finally I asked if I could help him with some thing. He snapped back if he could help me with something. I replied back how he keeps stairing me down. He said I was the one looking at him and he was “scanning” the boarding area doing his job. Every flight we have ever had with this company has been bad. They may have one or two employees that are good. 99% of them are horrible"
810,"Not Verified |  I booked a flight to Tampa through budgetair which consisted of a connecting flight. Toronto to Charlotte, NC to Tampa. The aircraft was having maintenance issues which lead to the airline saying they would update us once they recieved information in 45 minutes. These 45 minutes increments went on for five hours leading everyone to miss their connecting flight. Little information was shared and no other flights were available. The A.A representatives were extremely rude to all concerned passengers. Following cancellation, the airline was forced to rebook everyone to the following day. They sent emails with hotel & food voucher but they were for Charlotte), not where I was stuck (in Toronto). Since it was late no one could get a hold of a representative. When I called customer service the first rep was extremely reluctant to help. The supervisor kept me on hold for 45 minutes trying to get in touch with someone at the airport. No one was there so I was stranded with no where to go, having to sit in arrivals all night and morning until the flight the next night. It was a devastating night. The following day when I made my second attempt to get to Tampa. The tickets they issued were a massive downgrade from my previous flight. I was placed in the back of plane with no option for my allowed carry on. The two representatives at the desk were again overly rude with all passengers for no reason. The women would address everyone with abrupt and condescending tones when people inquired about carry-on luggage or connecting flight info. I WOULD NEVER FLY with this company strictly based on the terrible experience with all staff. Delta is the way to go if flying to US destination. I have flown to over 40 countries with at least 12 different airlines, I have experienced delays but nothing compares to this awful experience."
811,"  Hartford to Dallas. My 4 year daughter and myself were flying with our pet, and right from the rip, the customer service/baggage check in woman was super nasty. Before even looking at our pets paperwork she was telling us she couldn't fly. I gave her all the proper documentation and she still wouldn't let our dog fly. On top of that, I asked her if there if we could get a cart ride to our terminal because I am 6 months pregnant, with back issues and a 4 year old. Her response was, ""We have wheel chairs."" So we walked and low and behold, there is one of those golf carts sitting right in front of terminal, not being used. Fast track, our dog stayed behind and I contacted guest relations, as I was instructed to do. She issued us vouchers, for the incorrect amount, twice, just to find out they can not be used for pet travel. On top of that, the airline wants to charge us an additional $125 for our pet to fly since we won't be on the flight with her, totaling $325 instead of $200. Their responses, ""Sorry for the inconvenience but we can not do anything."" Needless to say, by far the worst airline customer service we have ever encountered, and we will NEVER fly American Airlines again!"
812,"Not Verified |  Good luck if you flying with American airline, my first time and only time with this company, I have to forced to stay in Toronto for one extra day with paying extra car rental and hotel, missing work because they canceled our flight, but our friends were able to fly with Westjet under the same weather? American  Airlines did not try to offer any compensation!"
813," Raleigh to Miami. I just want to start by clarifying that the rating is exclusively for the agent to check us in at Durham airport, who had a choice to be or not to be hospitable with my wish for an extra seat for my lap toddler, if available, and he chose to be hospitable and do his best to accommodate us. Despite the fact that the agent next to him was repeatedly telling him that “I get what I pay for” and that I bought “2 seats in economy so that’s what I get” Well to my luck, he was more understanding and empathetic than his coworker (she probably is not a mother.) Although I knew that he could have said no because I “did not pay” for her seat, why deny it if the plane has available seats?! Why even bother to deny a child a seat? Thank you for being an understanding and compassionate being. Cheers to you and I sure hope your kindness takes you far. To the agent next him Bill - you have a lot to learn in this business, you should start by being more respectful to customers in front of you and compassionate towards others."
814,"  My recent trip to Jacksonville (JAX) was plagued with problems the minute I became an American Airlines passenger. I want to be clear that the first leg of my journey from Seattle to Dallas (DFW) on Alaska Airlines. I can’t say enough good things about them. I continue to be a very loyal Alaska consumer. My American Airlines 8:35pm flight from DFW to JAX backed out from the gate on time. Before entering the taxiway, the pilot came on saying there were mechanical problems and we had to return to the gate. A bit later we were told to deplane. No one was able to provide any information on whether the flight was going to continue or not. Around 930/10 pm, American announced the flight was canceled. I then headed with the 200 other passengers to the American Airlines Customer Service desk where I waited in line for over an hour. By the time I reached the desk, it was midnight. I was “automatically” put on a 5AM flight from DFW to Charlotte (CLT) then on to JAX. The customer service lady and I agreed that a hotel room would be worthless, since the flight was scheduled for 5AM. She offered me a meal voucher, which I accepted. A whole $12 voucher. $12 to spend in the airport. Unfortunately, the stores were closed and there was nowhere I could spend the $12. I spent the night in DFW waiting for a 5am flight, all due to American Airlines’ mechanical problems. At some point, I called American’s customer service to see if I could get better compensation. I was told no, $12 is it. Nothing else. Have a good night. My early AM flight was also grounded due to mechanical problems on American Airlines. While we waited on the plane, several people deplaned. Some spread out. Finally, over 2 hours after our scheduled departure, the gate agents came on to do a final head count. The count was so far off, that they made us deplane and replane. Again, more passengers abandoned the flight for other options. I was now going to miss my connection in CLT due to American Airlines’ mechanical problems. By this time, my last meal was over 24 hours ago. I was unable to eat in the airport because I either had to stay at the gate, was captive on a broken American Airlines plane, or nothing was open. The snacks American offered I could not eat due to being gluten intolerant. I finally made it to CLT, the plan leaving over 2 hours late. Fortunately, my connection was also late due to weather and not a mechanical problem (what a refreshing change). I arrived in Jacksonville 18 hours after I was supposed to and after a journey that took 36 hours instead of 12. All of this due to multiple mechanical problems on American Airlines. To add insult to injury, American clearly demonstrated that my value as a paying customer is worth all of $12 to them. However, since I was never able to use the voucher, my value to them is actually worth $0. Which is exactly what I will be giving them in the future! Journey took 36 hours and should have been 12."
815,  Atlanta to Chicago. The flight was smooth. I will definitely be back to purchase flights again. Wish it was more leg room but the flight and snacks we're great. Thank you American airlines for my smooth trip. 
816,"  American Airlines is a hot mess! Do not fly this airline. We flew from Philly to Jax hole  via Chicago, a route we have done 5 other times on other airlines with no problems. On American, our flight from Chicago to Jax hole was cancelled and we got to vacation a day late. On the way home, American delayed our flight by 7 hours and then cancelled. It then booked us a day later to Columbus (we need to go to Philadelphia!). We had to talk to a gate agent to fix this and then got a route with 2 stops one in Chicago, the other in Columbus before finally getting to Philly. I don’t know how such an incompetent airline is going to get us to all of these stops in time and can’t wait to see where we get stuck tomorrow. Further evidence of american’s incompetence is that they put us up at a spring hill suites in Jax hole where the hotel had no rooms. The poor people at the hotel desk had to shuffle all kinds of things to help us. American said mechanical issues caused our first cancellation and then a “multitude of problems” caused the second delay and cancellation. Take care of your planes American and get a handle on your scheduling! If you want to get your flight cancelled and scramble go for American. They do that really well. I am never ever flying American again and will go out of my way to not fly this horrific airline. They just don’t care. A gate agent working for American told me “this happens to everyone” about all of my cancellations. That statement is so indicative of how they feel about its customers. No big deal, we will ruin your vacation, mess up your life on the way home and cost you tons of money. I should add that my previous 2 business trips were also a horrendous experience. In February 2019, I had a meeting in Orlando and American delayed the 8:55pm flight by 2 hours because the overhead bin doors were broken. How does this happen? I got to my destination at 1am. Great when you have an 8am meeting the next day. My other trip was to Indianapolis from Philly. American cancelled that flight because the crew timed out and made no effort to rebook us. I would have missed my important meeting if I relied on American. I ended up flying delta to Cincinnati and then Uber’d To Indy. Unbelievable. The last debacle that I will leave you all with is our vacation to Vail last March (2018). Also a route from Philadelphia to Dallas to vail airport. Our flight should have left at 1pm for Dallas, it was delayed 2 hours and then 2 more hours and then the flight finally took off at 7pm, so we missed our connection in Dallas to vail and as a result had to stay over in Dallas and then go to vail the next day. We got to vacation a day late. I should have learned from this experience! Never again, American. You don’t care about your customers and are a complete cluster. I fly a lot for work as well, and whenever I can, I will not be taking American unless absolutely necessary and it will be begrudgingly!"
817,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Cancun. American Airlines is the worst airline I have ever witnessed. I had a ticket that they just disregarded and therefore I am pushed back to take a 1:45 flight which ruins my day plans and trip plans. The flight attendants made it completely unclear as to the volunteer and voucher program and therefore now that I did not volunteer but was forced to not board my flight, I am not getting a travel voucher and am not guaranteed to be on the next flight. I am now waiting for 5 hours at DFW on my birthday still unsure as to if I will get in the next flight. The communication in this airline is terrible. Flight attendants are uninformed and are incompetent at giving customers information as to why 60 paid customers who bought their tickets 6 months in advance are now forced to take a later flight that we are not even guaranteed to go on. Overall, a horrible experience that of course I have to deal with on my birthday and am now missing and entire day of my three day trip. I wish that this airline would compensate for all the issues this has brought me for their lack of supplying seats to customers who have had a seat on this flight for over 6 months. No one should ever fly this airline, you will end up missing your vacation and stuck in the airport with no explanation."
818,"  Denver to St. Louis via Chicago. American Airlines is a complete joke! First they lose my email so it was nearly impossible tracking down my boarding pass. They do not care at all for making that easier on the customer. Then my flight was running behind (not delayed, just behind) so I was late for my layover and my ticket had me boarding at the wrong gate. I finally tracked down customer service and there was a huge line. People from different flights having similar problem. Customer service didn’t even care. The offered me a possible discount at a nearby hotel. They should have refunded me every dime and paid for my hotel in full. I had to spend the night at the Chicago O’hare airport which is not accommodating at all. Do not fly American Airlines! I’ve talked to so many others and I wish I knew before hand. Stay away from American Airlines."
819,"  Los Angeles to Miami. I was refused to be refunded for the airfare of the flight which had to be canceled due to my daughter’s illness. She was only 9-month old baby who was badly vomiting and at high risk to fly. As advised by the AA airline, I provided an explanation and discharge papers from the doctor. However, it did not touch anyone in American Airline’s customer service because three weeks later, I received a cold statement that refund is not allowed. I’m so greatly disappointed that will never consider American Airline again and definitely discourage my relatives and friends from considering their service."
820," I have been flying AA for over 20 years, 10 of which I have been Executive Platinum. I travel nearly 200,000 miles/year on AA. It seems AA have seriously gone down hill in recent years. Their on time record due to equipment troubles have been so poor that it's become unreliable for a business traveler. As an example, in just two recent weeks I've missed a connection in London due to a 2 hour delay because we had to switch planes for equipment problems. Then my flight from DFW to SEA was cancelled over 24 hours before the flight, again due to ""equipment problems"". How can you not get a new plane in place over the course of a day when they already know the plane has problems. This has become more the norm for AA than it should ever be. I am so disappointed with the drop in quality level of the on time performance and random cancellations that I am considering switching airline loyalty."
821,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Phoenix. The gate agent in Dallas was not checking the size of the Carry-ons. Once he realized space was an issue baggage started being checked for size. I was forced to check my brand new bag, his response was ""I should've gotten to the gate earlier"" well if my connecting flight was delayed i wouldn't me in this situation. Who speaks to customers like this? When i boarded the plane it was obvious that no one checked to see if there was actually room for carry-ons. 3 empty overhead compartment. The agent showed no compassion in regards to my situation. i was flying for business and did not have the time to check a bag. i also had very expense components within my suitcase for work in which i was told ""the airline insures it"". long behold when i received my luggage from the carousel one wheels were broken off."
822,"  This wasn't my first time flying with American airlines but it will definitely be my last. For starters, I have had more than one bad experience with them. This time, I was flying from Lafayette to a connecting flight in Dallas and then to Toronto. I always check my flight status ahead of time and there were no reported delays or changes. But for some reason, the agent at the boarding gate in Lafayette was not letting us board at our scheduled time. They gave us no information as to why we were waiting and told us we would be boarding shortly. Well, 'shortly' became at least 40 minutes. After landing in Dallas, my party and I found out the gate and terminal had changed from what was on our boarding passes and switched to the other side of the airport. After running through the crowded hallways and shouting apologies we made it to our gate which was already closed and unstaffed, about 10 minutes before our scheduled flight. At the next American airlines customer assistance counter, we were told the next available flight would be the next day. Myself and at least 10 other customers were trying to figure out how this happened as we all arrived to our first flight well ahead of the scheduled time. The agents at the service counter were saying it was coded in the system as 'delayed due to weather' ... but why then were the other similar flights, one of which departing just 10 minutes before ours, not also delayed due to weather...? How was this one flight in particular the only one delayed due to weather? Why was the online flight tracker not updated? And why was it listing our first plane as 'landed on time' in Lafayette... ? We took a step aside, and called the customer assistance number and agents over the phone were saying there was no reason listed for the delay. I took my phone back to the counter and had both agents speak to each other, who could not agree on the information they each had available. After they decided to agree-to-disagree, they informed us that their policy does not offer any accommodations for room, food or necessities. We were told the reason being that it was coded as a weather delay... Now, I was never rude or took a tone with the service agents, but they were still not helpful or empathetic to the situation, I guess they are just too used to delivering bad news. They also never offered any information about the area such as what hotels are nearby, even after we asked. At this point, I asked for a supervisor who could offer more assistance in this area, yet we were told that a supervisor would tell us the same thing, and we would be 'wasting our breath'. The only alternative we were offered was the website to American airlines, where we could send an email. This whole experience has left me quite skeptical about the information being given from American Airline and its service agents, who may use these 'codes' to protect themselves from obligations and policies they advertise to its customers. Please consider my experience as a warning for anyone looking to book any flights with AA online, and please exercise caution especially when booking connecting flights with them as they allow a minimum window of 30 minutes between connecting flights and will not accommodate you if your next flight is missed, even if they are solely responsible and the situation is out of your control."
823,"  Cancellations and delays are part of air travel. However customer service reps with attitudes are ridiculous. It wasn’t just one, but each individual we encountered and observed in both airports seem to not have a concern in the world if we enjoyed the flight."
824,"  The worst airline. On my trip from Nashville to Dallas they made us wait more than an hour inside the plane for maintenance problems, which caused me to lose my connection to Mexico City. They offered me the next available flight. To make this experience more terrible, this second flight, ALSO had technical problems. 40 minutes of delay have passed and we are still not taking off. I missed a great date for your poor service. I always use United, but for wanting to arrive 30 minutes earlier I decided to use american. What cost me until now more than 3 hours more! ES:   La peor linea aerea. En mi viaje de Nashville a Dallas nos hicieron esperar mas de una hora dentro del avion por problemas de mantenimiento, lo que hizo que perdiera mi conexion hacia Mexico city. Me ofrecieron el siguiente vuelo disponible. Para hacer esta experiencia mas terrible, este segundo vuelo, TAMBIEN tuvo problemas tecnicos. Han pasado 40 minutos de retrazo y seguimos sin despegar. Perdí una gran cita por su mal servicio. Simpre uso United, pero por querer llegar 30 minutos antes decidí usar american. Lo que me costó hasta ahorita mas de 3 horas MAS!"
825,"Not Verified |  Washington to Charlotte. I had three flights, and they wouldn’t give me a seat on the first one. Finally managed to get on, then the flight got seriously delayed so I missed both my layovers because of it. Don’t buy from them because you’re not guaranteed the seat you paid hundreds of dollars for."
826,"  I was flying from Lubbock to Dallas Ft Worth via Houston. My flight landed on tarmac at 605am. I was at the tarmac for 30 min flying American Eagle flight. As soon as it reached the jetbridge, i was out of there making my connection to the other terminal so I wouldn't miss my flight to Houston. After running hard and fast, I managed to reach my gate. I was stopped and asked for my id and boarding pass. I showed it to them. The lady remarked she was too busy at the starbucks to come sooner, looking at my starbucks bag. I was so shocked at the way she looked and assumed it was my fault somehow. I don't need terrible customer service at the gate as well as in flight to start my day bad. Please be courteous to your customers and try flying your flights on time rather than assuming your customers are late."
827,"  Denver to Garden City via Dallas. 4 flights on American Airlines, and late 4 times. That's a 0% on-time rate. This is a terrible airline. Average time late: 1hr. Don't fly American! Any airline is better than this."
828,"  Reno to Long beach via Phoenix . We booked a flight departing Reno airport at 9.29am which was to land at LAX 11.09am (AA 6018). AA 6018 got cancelled due to weather conditions (other airlines like Southwest didn't cancel their flights) and were booked on a new route which had a layover at Phoenix. The flights were AA 546 departing Reno at 12.45pm and landing in Phoenix at 3.28pm and AA5896 departing Phoenix at 3.56pm and landing in Long Beach at 4.15pm. You can already see how tight this layover is. The first flight was late in Phoenix by just minutes but we arrived at gate A7 and were supposed to depart at gate B16, running took 10 minutes. My sister and I caught the plane before the gate closed and were checked in but the employee who checked us in held on to my ticket in her hand while she assisted other travellers, answering their questions and letting them through. The other passengers on our first flight (AA 546) who were running towards this connecting flight (AA5896) arrived at gate B16 and the employee realised there were so many other passengers who had to board and decided to close the gate. She and the subsequent managers and other AA staff insisted that it was standard procedure to close the gates 10 mins before the flight and there was no communication from the first flight to hold this connecting flight. They even called security when one of the passengers who arrived later than us (but before the gate closed) started crying. The AA staff had us booked on the next flight from Phoenix to Long Beach (AA5899) which was delayed by 1.5hrs. The flight duration between PHX and LGB is also 1.5hrs. We realised on hindsight that even if we had got on AA5896, our checked bags wouldn't have anyway. American Airlines never should have offered such a connecting flight to passengers. Half an hour layover is clearly insufficient if passengers have to change planes and if AA flights were going to land late (it happens so frequently that it should be included in the flight time). If they told passengers that the connecting flight would be held (they told the passenger who cried), then the flight should have been held. Who lies about stuff like that? The AA employee couldn't maintain order. She prioritised passengers who were behind me while holding on to my processed ticket because they were more aggressive. My sister had already been processed and was waiting for me on the inside of the gate. She saw the employee tear my processed ticket after she closed the gate (literally in my face)."
829,"Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Washington DCA. American entices customer loyalty by allowing preferred seat selection but then changes the plane (and the seat) without notification. As a consequence I ended up on a 5.5 hour flight in standard coach. I am 6'2"". This amounts to fraudulent business practices. American's customer relations response is to say no seats are guaranteed. They bank on frequent fliers like me (I have platinum status with American) selecting preferred seats and then filling their seats by switching aircraft. After 30 years and 1.3 million miles with American I am changing airlines. Their deception and poor service are intolerable. The planes themselves are often old, the seats are unusually cramped, and amenities that are now standard (accessible plugs, screens at each seat) on other airlines are often missing."
830,"  Dallas to Rapid City. I will not choose American Airlines again. We were suppose to depart at 8:40am and we still have not moved and it’s 10:20am. They first told us it would be a 20 minute wait and we would be on our way. I did appreciate the flight attendants, but other than that this time delay is ridiculous."
831,"  Fort Lauderdale to Chicago. American Airlines is flat out horrible. We had a nightmare of a time getting to Fort Lauderdale from Madison. Initially the our flight was delayed 30 minutes for bad weather. We were not upset about that. However, once all the passengers were boarded, we were asked to unload because of a mechanical sensor issue which took another 2 hours to fix. We ended up having to stand in long lines and rebook our connection 3 different time. All in all an 8 hour delay! When we finally got back on that flight, the pilot says they have to fuel up!! They couldn't have done that when they were fixing the sensor?!?! If that whole situation wasn't unfortunate enough, we got bumped from our original return flight and are now getting home over 5 hours later than we wanted to. When we asked about getting on an earlier flight, we were told no and each customer service person we spoke to was unaccomodating and rude."
832,  Denver to Los Angeles. Out of all the planes at Denver Airport American Airlines fails again. They had us wait 2.5 hours on the plane while they de-ice. We are 3 houra late to LEX and no one talked to any of us about compensation or refunds. We pay a lot to fly and i expect American Airlines to get me to my destination in a reasonable time. Today they failed.
833,"  Chicago to New York JFK. Reasonably short internal domestic flight to connect to LHR via JFK. All one can say about this airline is ""grin and bear it"". It is truly grim beyond grim. Flying American Airlines for internal US domestic travel is done under total sufferance. They will charge you for everything, including seat selection and baggage. This is precisely what happens when the likes of American Airlines have a virtual monopoly for US air travel. The ONLY reason to fly this airline, is that their frequent flier program is probably the easiest to use compared to Delta or United. Don't look nor expect any kind of reasonable service from this airline, from check-in to baggage collection, and the in-flight experience is terrible in economy class. What a shame!"
834,"Colorado Springs to Orange County via Dallas. One flies with American Airlines with trepidation and a heavy heart. The decline of this once great airline is quite sad, but airline choices in the USA generally are limited. I used a combination of reward miles and revenue ticket, and requested a simple upgrade to domestic US First Class, using AAdvantage miles. They finally granted an upgrade, but only on the short COS-SNA sector, not the longer DFW-SNA sector. However, predictably American billed for the entire sector, and also had the temerity to bill a further $150.00 for same day flight change, and the upgrade. I couldn't believe it! Not only is the service on this airline non-existent, but they bill additional charges for almost everything. It is a wonder they don't bill for breathing on the airplane, or using the bathroom. Anymore, flying in the USA on American Airlines is mere transport. They are low class at best, certainly not First Class."
835," San Juan to Salt Lake City with American Airlines. The worst flying experience ever! Flights overbooked, one was delayed 4hrs so we missed our connecting flight, our luggage was put on the wrong plane. Very unprofessional and unorganized."
836,"  While the airlines cannot control the weather, they can certainly control the customer service (or lack of) that their paying customers receive. I missed my connecting flight to Greensboro from Charlotte on 2/19/2019 due to rainy, cold weather. I entered Charlotte airport at concourse A and had to depart from concourse E which is about a 12-15 minute walk. Once I was informed that plane's door was closed and could not be opened, I asked what my options were, I was told everything from ""rent a car, it's only an hour away"" to ""go stand in line"". An agent pointed at the Customer Service area which had approximately 100 people surrounding it. I was told I could either go stand in line or give the airline a call. It would have been helpful if the agents could have provided information regarding when the next flight out was scheduled, a list of hotels available in the area, or who to contact for questions. None of this was offered to me. Instead, I had to listen to a ground crew staff complain that the flight attendant let passengers disembark the plane before the ground crew were ready and watch an agent put chapstick on while he was trying to deal with upset passengers. There was a glaring lack of professionalism from almost every employee I encountered with American Airlines. It was clear that passengers missing their flight were not American Airline's problem, and agents were quick to let me know that they were under no obligations if the delay was weather-related. After the chaos had subsided, I was able to speak calmly with an agent and get a boarding pass out for the next morning. I was also able to book a room with no assistance from American Airlines. I was lucky to find a room at all and got one of the last rooms at a Best Western 15 minutes away. Once I got to the airport the next morning, the screen listed my gate as Arkansas instead of Greensboro; when I asked the agent if I was at the correct gate, she said ""hold on, I need to log out"", then proceeded to finish her conversation with her co-worker. The agent finally responded with a ""yes"" and no apologies for the screen not indicating Greensboro were offered. Greensboro was never put up on the board which caused confusion for several passengers. It was announced later that this flight was going to Greensboro, NC but Arkansas still showed as the point of destination for Gate 33 passengers as we boarded. Would it be too much to have passengers that are connecting to another flight, to disembark the plane prior to other passengers? If I had gotten to the gate 2 minutes earlier, I would have made the connection. I have flown with American many times previously and have encountered rude agents; however, the agents in Charlotte are by far the rudest. This is the last time I will look the other way and chalk up bad attitudes from agents as having a bad day. I would highly encourage American Airlines to provide customer service training to your staff. I will not recommend this airline to my co-workers nor my family, as I would not want anyone to experience such a disregard for simple human kindness and courtesy."
837,"  Frankfurt to Dallas via Los Angeles. It's all about the money for AA - no interest in performing a quality service. If you book their lowest fare, you are guaranteed not to sit with your partner but instead always in a center section seat. In fact, they go out of their way to ensure this: We were both assigned center section seats between a vacant aisle and window seat. I look at the seat map and there were 76 vacant seats with 32 possible adjacent seating combinations. I have never heard of a company that brings out a product and then makes sure you hate it. We asked to sit together at the airport and were told : 100€ and that we should have paid the $12 at home or the $240 to have an ""upgraded"" fare. British also assigns you a middle seat but their airport staff cheerfully reseat you when you ask - without any ""I told you so"" attitude. Ground staff is good, but the inflight crew all have chips on their shoulders. It makes you miss Eastern Air Lines."
838,  Orlando to Phoenix. I think this is the worst airline. Every time we fly with them there is an issue. Booked seats 3 months and advance and got split up with 4 little children! Waiting on the plane for 3 hours to exit the plane and was late for the next international flight. No one was even helpful about it. Lost luggage which took 2 weeks to be found. Constantly delayed flights. We just hope we will never need to use this airlines again .
839,"Not Verified |  I did not fly with American however the ground team accidentally took my luggage to Phoenix from Houston and it now sits at Tucson airport. The team won’t deliver to UA agents so that it can be returned to me. I travel with AA however recently reduce how often due to poor quality service. I continue to encounter this. When I called, the call center agent was unforgivably rude. When I pointed that out the response was met with more rudeness. When asked for supervisor they placed me on hold with no sign getting my call redirected. I am still waiting on my luggage to be returned. Please make some minor effort to help resolve this issue and return luggage. This would take communication and teamwork. Why is that a challenge?"
840," Was a little apprehensive flying with American Airlines after reading previous reviews but was pleasantly surprised by the overall experience. The aircraft itself was clean, spacious and the seats comfortable. The food - has to be some of the best I have ever had flying, and I have traveled on a lot of airlines! I especially loved the sesame chicken with tabbouleh salad and sesame soy dressing - so delicious! It was also a nice touch before departing Sydney a menu was handed out detailing the food to come and at what time during the flight it would be served. The inflight entertainment system was fantastic with so much to choose from, including films that had just been released in cinemas. And finally the cabin crew - were professional and friendly. There was one guy recommended sites to see in the states. All in all an incredible experience and I could not highly recommend American Airlines."
841," On February 16, 8:45 am we took a flight from JFK to Cancun, flight number 1327, it was me, my husband and my kids, my youngest being my three year old daughter, who was flying for the first time. Once we landed and we were waiting to get out of the plane, my daughter, obviously being in a new environment began crying, I was trying to make her feel better and stop crying when one of the air hostess came up to me and told me this is unacceptable you are the mother you need to make her stop crying. I was so appalled by your employees attitude and customer service to a family who trusted your airline for our travel. I have never been treated this way in my life and I was so disappointed and upset with the way my children and myself were treated. Your employees lack of customer service and respect towards paying customers was appalling, and put a very big damper on our family vacation. I did not expect this from American Airlines and I expected your airline to treat your customers better. I will not be flying American Airlines again and I am very dissatisfied with the way your crew member have treated me and my family. As a business owner myself I know the importance of customer service and putting a customer first, I did not see that kind of service when I flew your airline."
842,"  La Guardia to Dallas Ft Worth. Well, flying is already not pleasant, and I am not that frequent of a flyer, about 750k miles toward the million miler, usually about 25-30kk miles a year, just under their gold tier. Here is my beef. The new basic fares where you only get half a leg credit. My company has a policy they says all of the employees must purchase the lowest published fare. Well, for American, that means basic economy. Flying on American Airlines went from bad to worse. I live in Dallas and it is tough to fly any other airline that doesn’t have a connecting flight. So I am stuck... a gold member they can’t select a seat, gets half credit for every flight, and just flies in misery. American should change the policy on basic fares and allow gold members or higher to at least be able to select seats. At this point, I truly hate living in Dallas because I have to fly American and they completely suck with these new policies."
843,  We were delayed by the airport shuttle and arrived 55 minutes prior to our flight departure and were not allowed to check in. We explained the delay was out of our hands. Because we missed the flight out they would not reserve the return flight even though it was paid in full. We had to throw the tickets away. We walked over to Delta and the agent just put a person on a flight to Costa Rica 35 minutes before his flight took off and they did have to check bags. Our flight was delayed on Delta which meant we were going to miss our connecting flight to Nassau. We were so disappointed. But Delta held the plane in Atlanta and moved it to the gate next to our arrival so they could collect us and get our bags.
844,"  Honolulu to Los Angeles. I attempted to check in online 18 hours prior to my flight. For whatever reason, the system processed mine but not my wife's. Since in the inbound flight we weren't seated together, I wanted to rectify this. I called AA and the first agent who answered immediately suggested it was my fault because I ""didn't check a box or something"". I suggested he first listen to me and run my record locator. All I wanted to do was ensure me. And my wife sat together this time. When he did, he said this is an issue with British Airways since they issued the ticket. I said that's impossible, because BA doesn't handle check in for flights on AA. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and was told to call BA or they could put me in touch with their website tech support (why?). Both the initial agent as well as the supervisor were incredibly rude and appeared to be doing whatever possible to get me off the line. I called BA. The agent, Dev, went above and beyond what could possibly be expected, and stayed with me for an hour to help. I explained what happened and he told me they're ""giving you the run around"" because, of course, BA doesn't handle check in for domestic AA flights. He offered to call AA for me and we were on a conference call. The supervisor he spoke to informed him that there was an issue with the passport info. He asked them to change the info and complete checkin and was told that was impossible. He said he knows for a fact it isn't, and it happens all the time. Since checkin wasn't my issue, but seating, he suggested my wife simply be given a seat next to me and she would complete checkin at the airport. The AA supervisor said that, too, was impossible. Until she's checked in, they can't assign a seat. Once again, the BA agent explained that this is impossible and he has lists of policies and regulations, not to mention previous experience. The AA supervisor hung up on him mid sentence. He apologized profusely and said he never experienced anything like this. We called again, and the agent we got this time was just as unhelpful and refused to do anything, but was at least pleasant. She suggested I pay to select my wife's seat, because next to me there is an empty one. The BA agent again asked why they can't assign it to her, it's within 24 hours of the flight. No. They won't assign it, they won't fix her checkin, but they're happy to SELL the seat. At this point in my frustration I said fine, I'll buy it. $50 additional fee if the agent takes my payment. Both me and the BA agent were at a loss for words. I ended up going online to buy the seat next to me for my wife, with Dev and the AA supervisor on hand to confirm it went through. AA succeeded in ruining my last day in Honolulu and wasting 2 hours of my time in order to squeeze even more money out of me. I would have thought that would be it, but upon arrival at Heathrow, I learned my bags didn't make the flight (2hr layover at LAX). This airline is an absolute joke, with complete disregard for passengers. Even the discount carriers treat you better. BA offered a black and white comparison between how an airline should behave and how it shouldn't. Dev was apologizing for things that weren't his fault, stayed with me until the end, whereas AA staff were aggressive and condescending, and even hung up on their British colleague. Absolutely shameful. The plane was also terrible, but west coast/Hawaii flights typically are. Shameful behavior."
845,  We had our wedding in Jamaica and had a group of 20 plus people. From the start to finish was awful. In Grand Rapids we were delayed and lied to. The ground crew were arguing with the flight crew and delayed our plane over an hour which made us miss our connecting in Charlotte. The gate agents give you excuse after excuse. Now after a great week in Jamaica it starts all over again at the airport. Once again no plane and delayed hours and lied to multiple times. Was told no worries when you get to Charlotte they will have hotel rooms for you since we all missed our connection again (20 people) by 25 min or so. After a couple of agents saying go here and there we finally find 3 ladies to talk to. They were very rude and no help at all. Basically said no hotels are booked and you are on your own. Now we are finally on a flight the next day and sitting here at the gate delayed again! Now an hour behind and still haven’t left. Would not recommend to even my worst enemy. In fact even if I was given vouchers for my trouble I would throw them out and spend money to fly with someone else.
846," San Antonio to Flint via Chicago. We will never fly with American Airlines again. As a precursor, I am a consistent traveler and have flown through just about every airline, experienced delays/cancellations, ect. As long as customer service present, I’m understanding and compliant. Unfortunately, the customer service experience element of AA wasn’t present today. To start, I received an email update our initial flight to our connecting flight was going to be delayed. Then we received another notification that it was delayed again. This second delay made us too late to make our connecting flight. We called and spoke to a representative from American Airlines and he said ALL flights were going to be canceled due to weather. This seemed shocking, so we hung up and called back. The second person said some flights were delayed, but not ALL canceled. We decided to go to the airport to see what options were available. Initially our first question was, “With this delay, will our connecting flight be delayed?” She said it was going to be on time and we would definitely miss is. She began suggesting alternative plans. We asked if we could transfer to other flights, she said she had nothing. We asked for other airlines, she said they had nothing. We asked to change our arrival city to be Detroit instead of Flint (Essentially we were trying to come up with solutions and she just stood there waiting for us to ask the right question to solve the problem—offering no suggestions of her own) Finally with that idea, she confirmed that was available. Okay, great. We went with that option. We had to wait at least 20 minutes for American Airline to book us a hotel and she emphasized it was the best option because of the 24 hr shuttle service which is perfect since we had a 5am flight. As soon as we get settled in the hotel, I receive an email notification that our connecting flight was delayed. I called and we could not get back on that flight and now obligated to take the new flight out the next day... We arrive to the hotel, check in and there is no 24 hr shuttle(after we were told there would be). We are told we have to provide our own transportation because we had an early flight. I called American Airlines to see if they could correct this, they said no, but we could file a claim. Next morning, we arrive back at the airport after we had to find a way to get there and our tickets had been voided. (What?!) They said our tickets had been changed/edited 11 times before it was finally just canceled! So, now we’re tired and frustrated because we were ill advised as to which flight to get on, no shuttle, had to pay for our own transportation, had to pay for a rental vehicle, and had to still pay for our seats and baggage check in. I’m not upset that I had to pay for seats and luggage or transportation and etc, I’m upset there was no customer service with this airline. We will never fly through this airline again and will be sure to inform others of our experience."
847,"  Toronto to Haiti via Miami. This review is based on my unfortunate experience with American Airlines starting the day of February 7th, 2019. I was travelling with 4 other female medical students from Toronto to Haiti to complete a week-long mission trip in Cap-Haitien. While boarding our connecting flight in Miami, we received word from Haiti that the country was now under protest and rioting in the streets and there were no vehicles allowed on the roads. There were barricades blocking the road to and from the airport and they could not find a company to pick us up. We immediately notified the AA gate staff and were assured that there was nothing going on in Haiti and it was safe to fly into. They were actually arrogant in their attitude and stated, “obviously we would know if something was going on, we wouldn’t fly into Haiti if there was.” They made us feel like we were stupid children. After boarding, we begged the American Airline attendant to please speak to the pilot to contact the Cap-Haitien airport and verify the information we received. Within minutes he returned explaining that they had heard nothing was going on. At that point, we had to trust the airline and flew into Haiti. Upon arrival, our worst nightmare came true. The country was in violent protests, rioting and fires everywhere. We could not get out of the airport. It didn’t take long for AA to rid themselves of any responsibility and they flew out, taking any hope we had of getting out with them. The airport tried to shuttle us out on an escorted shuttle, but we got attacked and had to return to the airport. Shortly thereafter, the airport closed. We had to either sleep outside the airport or try and pay someone to escort us safely out. We did the latter and ended up having to go to a hotel in the hills, away from our compound, clinic, and the patients we came to help. After 2 risky attempts where we had to return to the airport after getting stones and glass thrown at us, we reached our hotel. Fast forward to 4 days of trying to get back to the airport and out of Haiti, we called American Airlines several times to please come back and get the people who were left stranded there. We were told repeatedly that this was not their problem and that we could change our flights but at a cost. After several days and attempts to get past the fires, barricades and violence on the streets, we were able to get to the airport and catch a flight out. We were told verbatim that as long as it didn’t interfere with their flight pattern, what was happening on the ground in Haiti was not their problem. The hardest, and scariest thing to believe is that there was apparently no communication between the airports. I mean, it’s a freaking phone call!! I believe that American Airlines knew what was going on and just didn’t want to cancel that flight. I felt so unsafe and alienated, while they just flew off and didn’t give a care in the world about their passengers. Shame on you, AA."
848," Minneapolis to Dallas. Avoid American Airlines at all costs! They gave someone my seat after I boarded the plane. They then tell me a seat number that has someone in it. Then say they meant another seat. The seat they gave me had no foot area storage to put my backpack and the gate agent argued with me that there was room. He had to board the plane to prove him wrong. I hate this airline, they are garbage. Also the smallest seats and legroom of all of them."
849," Flew Savannah to Minneapolis via Charlotte. Our first flight was so delayed that our second flight was cancelled for us. American Airline was supposed to call us back within the hour. They never called so we went to the airport only to find out 2 other American flights were cancelled/delayed. Big mess! The agent in Savannah said hotel vouchers would be waiting for us in Charlotte. Not true, as there was a line of about 100 people waiting to get vouchers and the gate attendant said there were no rooms available in Charlotte anyway. I wouldn’t fly with American ever again!"
850, Lawton to San Francisco via Dallas. I booked all my tickets at the same time months ago and we the airline refuses to give my family seats together? A 5 hour flight and a 6 year old has to sit by herself? The airlines solution is that we have to beg someone to switch with us?! It's a full flight.
851,  Hartford to Grand Rapids via Philadelphia. Canceled flight and because they had a flight 23.5 hours later available they wouldn’t let me switch to another airline due to their 24 hour or later rule. Took me over an hour to get hold of anyone in customer service and when I spoke to a supervisor in Dallas he literally just kept quoting me their policies and wouldn’t even talk to me. What kind of customer service is this airline using?!
852," American Airlines customer service is extremely hard to contact and when I spoke with someone, they were not accommodating at all. I made the mistake of booking out of the wrong city and was willing to go on stand by. I was flexible with dates and times but they were not able to help in any way. I wasn’t able to get on any flight with a confirmation of a returned flight home with my reservation number. I didn’t feel cared about at all and will go back to continue my business with United. Although UA is a little expensive at times, they’ve always treated me well and their service in or off the plane is exceptionally professional. I may be out $400 and won’t be able to visit my family this year but I now know I can’t rely on this company in the future."
853,  I don’t know if it is their business model or just my bad luck but American Airlines seems to try to make the flying experience miserable. I regularly fly Southwest and there are never any problems. They have wrecked my family vacation for a second time in three years. Last time they didn’t have a plane and I had to sue them. This time all we wanted to do was get together with the family in Jackson hole Wyoming and they’ve done everything possible to destroy the trip. It is now five hours after the plane was supposed to go off and I’m going to have to spend the night in Dallas. Whatever you do don’t fly American Airlines. They really don’t care about you.
854,"  Los Angeles to Austin. Flown with American many times and none of the flights were ever spectacular but they got the job done. Not the case this time around. I had a flight time set for 4:05pm which got delayed to 5:30pm. I understood because it was due to weather. So here’s how my situation comes into play. My original flight was supposed to arrive in Austin by 9pm and my girlfriend (who lives in Austin) and I had Valentine’s Day dinner plans, which we delayed due to my flight. Now as I write this it is 6:15pm and I’m sitting in the airplane as it sits at the gate still in LA and our Valentine’s Day is completely shot. No explanation as to why we’re not taking off, no assistance on how to get a refund, little support all together. I know American Airlines is considered a mid tier service provider but with this experience and the mediocrity of so many previous experiences this will be the last time I fly with this company until I receive an apology. It’s downright rude to ignore your customers the way I’ve been ignored. Especially, since I was always calm and understanding and remained patient as I was passed along from one employee to the next. All I wanted was an explanation and an apology for the delay. Neither of which I received."
855,"  Chicago to Dallas Ft Worth. My flight was delayed due to smoke in the flight control room. The plane was redirected to another airport. When I landed in Dallas I called customer support to help me get on a flight. The gentleman I talked to was very nice. He told me about flights I could get on and told me he placed me on ""standby."" I then ran from terminal to terminal to try and get on this flight. When I got to the desk the american airlines desk told me I was not on the list for ""standby."" I called customer service back to ask why I was not put on ""standby"" he told me his computer told him I was on ""standby."" I then missed that flight that had open seats available because the agent did not tell me I was not on ""standby."" I was added as a request to be put on the flight. Which the team outside the plane could not see. The agent at the desk then looked into why I wasnt on ""standby."" He then found he had to remove what customer service placed on my name to allow me to be put on ""standby."" This then put me one name away from getting on the next flight. After not being able to make it on that flight I thought customer service should know about what happened. I talked to a service agent that dismissed everything I told her. I ask to then speak to a supervisor. She did not treat me with respect or listen to what had happened. She only wanted me to know that policy said they did everything right. She also said she didnt know they had to explain that when the agents put you on ""standby"" it's not actually ""standby."" As a customer who flights often I assumed the airline would want to know how to better improve there customer service. She did not find this as a priority. The supervisor then was rude and nothing, but negative against the customer. I hope this review can help other individuals who are stressed that their flight is missed. Do not call customer service - they do not help only tell you how you failed as a customer. I only wish to be told the information needed as a customer."
856,  Chicago to Jackson hole. The state of WY shut the road down to Jackson hole airport due to snow fall and wind. I called to see if they could help me adjust my flight by one day and they wouldn’t do anything for me. I am being told I need to purchase another ticket to get home. If the state shut the road down how do I get to the airport? The fine is $1000 if you travel the road. Thanks a lot AA! I will make sure the company I work for knows never to use AA ever again.
857,  Phoenix to Ontario. I been waiting for hours in the airport with absolutely no communication as to why our plane is late the service is 100% horrible probably will never fly American again should’ve known from last time because this is like a repeat offender
858,"  Denver to Phoenix. Agents at gate A53 was very rude to customers continuously. I arrived early and was just waiting near the gate and could not believe how the agent's would speak to customers. me being one. I will not recommend American Airlines to anyone. I am a senior citizen and required a wheelchair because of medical reasons not being able to walk long distances, the person transporting me was very rough had to take pain meds after arriving to my gate. The staff need customer service training. Worst experience ever."
859,"  St. Louis to Boston via Charlotte. Im a frequent traveler and I have pretty minimal expectations when it comes to flying economy. However, Americans Airlines does not meet any standards as far as timeliness or customer service. My first flight was delayed because we did not have any flight attendants. They were leaving the airport within minutes if boarding time. The gate attendants made their frustrations pretty clear. Actually- between both crews, the employees were speaking very unprofessionally within earshot. Even worse, this delay was because the flight attendants had “required” rest from a three hour delay the night prior. They could not begin the shift and we cannot board without them. If this was known in advance, why was the flight not delayed or alternate attendants provided? The gate ladies were livid at the lack of communication by AA. I nearly missed my connection. On my second flight, there were mechanical issues. This was announced after the left the gate and we had to turn around. We were stuck in the plane. Even worse- I was in the back row next to the toilet (which was being frequently used with the delay) and the woman in front of me was sick. She was sneezing, coughing, blowing her nose. The couple next to me moved To the other side of the plane. There were 10+ Empty middle seats on the plane. I said I was afraid of getting sick and sensitive to the smell of the toilet. I asked if I could move like the couple did and the attendant said no. I paid the base rate for my ticket. Group 9 can’t move around seats. Even under special circumstances.I flew with American a couple days ago as well. There was no WiFi. On another rip I was deplaned over an hour. As I mentioned, I fly often. I am going to miss work today. Thank you for making this an easy decision for me. This will be my last trip."
860,"  Orlando to Charlotte. Never flying American Airlines again. Missed my connecting flight due to delay and no other available flights out that night, so they booked me a flight out the following morning which was all fine and understandable. The problem is that they were not willing to purchase a hotel for me and this airport did not have anywhere to sleep. So now I had to pay an additional $100 for my trip plus taxi service. I paid American to get me from point A to point B and if they were unable to do so, they should have covered hotel expense same as they would if it had been a mechanical error. This Customer Service Rep at the airport also had no sense of empathy or customer service skills. Very dissatisfied and I'll be letting my job know to avoid booking with them in the future."
861,"Not Verified |  Boston to St. Louis. Avoid this company if possible. I purchased tickets online for business. I paid the insurance fee, an option provided BY American Airlines. Due to a snow-storm I needed to reschedule. When I tried to reschedule, I was only permitted to delay by a few days. I wanted to wait until the following week, and stick to my Mon-Fri schedule instead of arriving mid-week. They would not accommodate me this way. I could only reschedule within a limited time-frame. Any other flight at any other time would be full price. When I informed them about my insurance, I was told they don't actually have any, and I must contact the insurer directly, even though they haven't told me who that insurer is. All I could do was cancel the flight. Even though I opted for the insurance, certain flights are non-refundable (mine) so they should not have allowed the system to offer me insurance. Now that the flight is cancelled, even though the took my money, I didn't even get any mileage credits, and they will no longer provide me with a receipt so I can be reimbursed by my employer. This company has built-in anti-consumer policies, are dishonest, and likely to scam you through what they consider standard practices. All airlines in America overcharge, use hidden fees, and continually diminish the quality of their service while raising prices. It's hard to stand out as the worst in a world of terrible, but AA has absolutely done so."
862,  Charlotte to Buffalo. My flight was supposed to be from 10:10pm-11:45pm. It is currently 12:08am and we are still sitting on the plane. No one is talking to us. We don't know why we aren't moving. This is insane! We all just want to get to our destination. We are all cranky and hungry on this flight. No one is happy.
863,  Dayton to Miami. Every flight on my trip has been delayed. There seems to be multiple mechanical issues without the staff’s ability to verbalize the exact issue. Also- ticketing counter personal are incredibly rude. I am a frequent flyer and travel for business often. I will never fly American again.
864,"Not Verified |  Minneapolis to Miami. Just can’t thank you enough for the help we received after missing our connecting flight. American Airlines put us up in a hotel, gave us food vouchers and a shuttle to the hotel. It was nice to relax before catching our next flight to our destination. "
865,  New York to Dallas Ft Worth. This is the worst airline I’ve flown and I will never taken American Airlines again. I accidentally purchased a ticket to leave March 10th and I had to leave Feb 10th. I was at the airport when I found out. When I went to speak to the front desk no one was helpful. They said I couldn’t cancel my ticket and also lied and said I could change my flight. Finally after talking to 4 people I spoke with an agent who said I could use the funds towards a flight to leave today. The cost was suppose to be $373. after processing my credit card 6 times he tells me he didnt know how much I was charged. Come to find out i was charged $775 dollars plus a processing fee. They are horrible. Worst airport experience. 
866,  Fort Walton Beach to Pittsburgh. This was the worst experience flying I have ever had. They delayed my flight on 2/9/19 due to maintenance and I missed my connecting flight. Where I was supposed to fly Charlotte to Pittsburgh with a 1 hr layover. Any other later connecting flights were already overbooked. I had to miss work the following day and leave the next day 2/10/19. We left from ECP airport at 541 am and now had a 4 hr layover in Charlotte. They then delayed my connecting flight to Pittsburgh due to maintenance again where we are now currently waiting on a 5 hr layover and counting. There customer service department sucks just as bad as there flights do!
867,"Not Verified |  Wilkes Barre to Punta Cana via Charlotte. Purchased upgraded seats to Main Cabin Extra. Entitles priority boarding and complimentary drinks. As per American Airlines web site. First flight received champagne, had 2, next flight was told it was for 1st class only, had to pick something other, had 3 drinks. Return leg, asked for champagne and told again only 1st class can have it, had to choose something else. First 2 flights was not charged or asked to pay for drinks per upgrade. 3rd flight got 1st drink, asked for 2nd drink and was asked to pay. Told I only get 1st drink free and when I questioned attendants she stated, she wasn't going to argue with me about it and said just take it. 4 hour flight and was mad in what was told to me that didn't ask for any more and have to deal with attendant and piss poor attitude. Contacted AA to inquire about issues. AA stated unlimited drinks for free and anything I wanted. That didn't happen. Was told sorry I didn't get to experience what I was told. AA implemented Main Cabin Extra over a year ago and notified employees as per their web site of what MCE seats are entitled to. Was told in communication, sorry, multiple times. I had asked for some type of reimbursement or credit for another flight because of their lack of offering what people expect for upgraded seats and paid for. AA has what I feel is blockers just to tell you sorry, hoping you go away. I feel to tell everyone through here to ask and get what you are entitled to for what you pay for with AA with upgraded seats. In my last email, I was told sorry again, in that I didn't get as many drinks as I wanted. Well, that upset me even more. Was told in email that an attempt was made to contact me via phone. I was called, answered and no one responded. No attempt to call me again or leave voice mail or email me telling me so. Complete lack of professionalism from attendants, not knowing policies for upgraded seats to customer service in communication. When I did talk with customer service directly, was told sorry again and my complaint would be sent up the channels. No effort was tried by AA to please me and what I expected and didn't receive. Thumbs down with AA."
868,"Not Verified |  Columbus to Washington. Worst experience ever with an airline. My flight arrived early, at 7:50am didn’t get to the terminal until 8:25am, because planes were blocking our terminal. My next flight was to depart at 8:30am, arrived at the fat at 8:27am and my flight had already left. I’m stuck in an airport all day, until 6pm. I should have been in Key West by 11:30am. They refuse to compensate my time and the inconvenience. Not worth the money, fly Southwest or United."
869,"Not Verified |  San Jose to Phoenix. Looks like American Airlines are finally improving their customer service. FA's and gate agents on all of my 4 legs were way friendlier than those of my past experience a couple of years ago. They interact more with their pax and even smile. The new leather seat design looks nice and modern. On the 5 hours leg PHX-SJO you get a sandwich and They come around twice with drinks and non alcoholic beverages are for free. The captain or co comes out of the cockpit and greets the pax when they deplane. That's a very nice touch. They offer a good selection of movies and TV series for free, but you have to stream those via your phone or laptop since they got rid of the IFEs. That I do understand, but then they should at least offer power ports for your devices. Otherwise you may run out of battery mid flight."
870,"  Durham to Dallas Ft Worth. Terrible experience. They delayed my flight from 7 pm to 10 pm, then to 11:30 pm, then to 12:30 am, then to 9:30 am the following day, without an explanation. There were no other flights available, and this caused me to miss significant events that I cannot make up or be compensated for. Then, when I finally got on a flight the following morning, they made me check my carry-on bag and the gate attendant was extremely rude when I asked if there was any way to avoid checking my bag, as I have already missed so much of what I wanted to do, and wanted to minimize the delays as much as possible. Their seats are also small and uncomfortable. I hate American Airlines."
871,"Not Verified |  Orlando to Fort Wayne. Worst airline ever, our flight was delayed for no purpose other than to move another flight ahead. On top of that we got to our connector flight. However, when we got there the desk attendant had the audacity to say ""aww if only you were here 30 seconds ago, because we just stopped accepting changes."" But the flight was 10 minutes from boarding."
872,  Dallas Ft Worth to Ontario. Esther is amazing. A co worker and I missed our flight to LAX. She was working the check in station at another flight going to Ontario. She went above and beyond to help us make it on a flight so we can get home tonight and see our family. She is the embodiment of customer service and care. I will remember her and American Airlines for helping us out in our time of need! 
873,"  Ft Lauderdale to Marquette via Chicago. This trip was badly marred by American Airlines failing to provide the seat upgrades I paid for. The combination of my tall stature and lower back problems prevents me from squeezing myself into the ever-decreasing legroom of the economy cabins without severe consequences that last for many hours afterwards. Whenever I cannot afford to fly first-class, I take the precaution of buying seat upgrades to sit in rows with extra legroom. So far, American Airlines if zero-for-four on these seat upgrades, and their customer service personnel vehemently refuse to provide any compensation for  their failures. I could also mention the numerous blatant lies contained within the customer announcements in an attempt to hide their incompetence, and the beverage service that was annulled without any form of announcement, explanation, or apology. Other than to use up the air-miles I have accumulated, I will not be flying with American Airlines again. Having said all that, I have to give them two stars for value, since they are not the most expensive airline, and their cabin staff get an average rating as they are about as good as those on other airlines. Other than that, the only reason for giving them even one star is that I cannot award zero stars!"
874,"  Brussels to Tampa via London / Philadelphia. For the last 3 days I have called AA's Advantage line to discuss the fact that there will be a National strike in Belgium on Feb 13th (return flight date) and that I would like to know if I can change or forfeit the first leg of the flight from Brussels to London. News about the strike has been reported by several international news outlets since last week, and the strike is expected to shut down the whole country, including Brussels airport. However, American says they have not received any notice from HQ and so cannot make a change to my reservation without applying a fee. After receiving that same answer 3 times, I asked if I could get the number for HQ, but when I called and made my way through the 15 or so prompts to customer service, I received an automated message that they were closed and I should call back during regular business hours (it was 11am on a Tuesday mind you). Now I understand that procedures are there for a reason, and that the airline makes a pretty penny on ticket changes, but in cases like this one where it is clear no flights will take off from Bru on Feb 13th, why is it that I have to beg AA to look into the issue and be proactive about changing my reservation? I must be back stateside on the 13th, but what I fear is that I will get a message on the 12th telling me the flight has been cancelled and I am rebooked for the 14th, 15th or even later. Overall, I am frustrated with the AA Advantage experience and reps & supervisors telling me their hands are tied until HQ gives them the go ahead. I am also frustrated that despite being a loyal customer for the last several years I feel like AA is giving me the runaround and could care less about my concern re getting back on the 13th. Very disappointing."
875," New York JFK to Boston. I counted 72 vacant window and aisle seats vacant on this flight yet their system assigns me a middle seat between a vacant aisle and window? All so they can get an extra $9 from me? I think that is craven and base. United is the worst US airline but they don't do that to their customers. Neither does DL, B6, or AS, so I will patronise them in the future. There is more to life than getting the last penny out of a person's pocket. Have asked my travel agent to void the ticket and have rebooked Jet Blue, who allows you to pre-assign seats at no cost."
876,"  My family and I were flying home from Hawaii on American Airlines. My 7 month old son was on my lap. Our flight flew through a weather system (that had grounded many other airlines) and we experienced turbulence for 3.5 hours. At one point the turblance was so severe that my son went flying through the air and landed on his head. My head was cut open and I got a concussion, and some crew were injured and were unable to work the rest of the flight. The only thing they offered was a dry cleaning voucher upon arrival, they had paramedics at the gate waiting for the crew, but never offered medical help to passengers. I called American Airlines, and they told me that next time I should purchase a seat for my infant and that they would give me a dry cleaning voucher and review any out of pocket medical expenses. I will never fly American Airlines again."
877,"Not Verified |  Philadelphia to Miami. Horrible flight. Once my group was called they ran out of carry on space and had to put my very tiny suitcase with the luggage forcing me to go through baggage claim on both of my flights! Then once on the plane they detected a problem with the plane that took an hour to fix; this is fine, it happens but when it happened on my flight home as well I was a little more upset. It took two hours to fix on the way home; the duration of what my flight should have been. Will never fly American again. My first experience there was horrible. No reason why my flight to and my flight home should have had the exact same issues. Never again"
878,"  Las Vegas to Chicago via Milwaukee. Our airline was late due to a flight attendant being late to board the plane, the flight was delayed a total of 3 times putting us approx. 45 minutes behind. We did make up some significant time on our duration and got off the plane with about 20 minutes to spare, we ran across the airport to our gate where we learned that they gave our seats away due to us. It being there, the funny thing was they also informed us that they oversold our flight and gave our seats to those people. The best the guy at the counter could offer us was a flight almost 4 hours later or a $20 bus ticket-  unbelievable, one of the most unaccomadating experiences I have been related to. Come on American get your act together."
879,"  Roanoke to Charlotte. Cancelled last leg of flight on Thursday. Said it was because of weather but another flight went out 1 hour later. Customer Service told me the best they could do was a Sunday flight. Decided not to wait in the airport for 3 days and rented a car to drive. No reimbursement for rental car. After 4 emails and a phone call, gave up on their customer service department. 5 Business Trips in the last 30 days with American. From this point forward, American is my last choice. "
880," Chicago to Detroit. anged departure times 3 times due to delayed flight, changed gate, changed plane and my seat. Seat was the most uncomfortable I’ve ever sat in. Sat on runway waiting to arrive. Will avoid American Airlines like the plague from now on."
881,"Not Verified |  La Guardia to Lansing. This is one of the worst airlines. I have had the opportunity to fly with 3 different airlines to Lansing, Michigan. I must say that American Airlines has despicable service. They constantly change their itinerary, delay flights, cancel on you after waiting at the airport, makeup excuses and do not assist you in any way if you have to change your itinerary. I definitely recommend using Delta instead. I have had many ongoing issues with flights I looked in advance through American Airlines but after I have used the purchased tickets, I will never use their services. In addition to all their horrible service, they treat you as if you are nobody if you buy economy flights ( mind you some flights have cost me more than first class over $500 from NY to MI - which is about a 3 hr trip on plane) and ask you to purchase better seats if you want ""courtesy"" assistance from them despite them being at fault. I truly dislike the poor service provided by the airline."
882," Paris CDG to Chicago O'Hare with American Airlines. This flight was fantastic. A 9-Hour flight was made extremely comfortable definitely because of the new aircraft but and the in-flight crew. The crew was so friendly and handled everything professionally. The aircraft was also amazing. It was a brand new Boeing 787 with amazing inflight entertainment, super smooth take off/landing, and an extremely quiet, modern, and clean cabin. We were also allowed to move around because the flight was not full."
883,"  Belize to Toronto via Miami. Both my trip out of Toronto on January 20th and my return on January 30th were unnecessarily delayed it would seem. The delayed departure reason given was that the plane had not been serviced the prior evening so needed to be done while we sat in it. Really? On return, we sat in YYZ on the taxi way for 90 minutes due to a gate not being prepared. Someone isn’t doing their job and doesn’t care about the passengers. It’s was 1:30am getting off the plane."
884,"Not Verified |  Minneapolis to Charlotte. Usual poor customer service we have all come to expect from airline companies. Flight delays, overbooked flight, and no room for overhead baggage. App wouldn't load tickets at time of flight (website also encountering errors). On site customer service reps were extremely slow."
885,  Los Angeles to Sacramento. American Airlines is the nastiest between the US airlines!  Next time will fly with Alaska! It was last flight and canceled it and there was another fight get issues like my flight too. The seats are too small although im not a big guy. There was plenty of empty seats from my flight from SMF-LAX but they put us three people in three small seats! not sure why no flight attendants even ask us are you comfy? d
886,  Flying from New York to Chicago was repeatedly delayed due to weather. After calling customer service to try to change flights I was put on hold for 40 minutes. Then when I requested the change I was told by the representative that she did not have access to the flight info and I would have to re-book at the desk when I got to the airport. When I went to the desk I was told that “customer service is lazy and should have already re-booked me.” A 1255pm flight ended taking off at 345pm. After landing and Waiting at the gate we were informed that the jet bridge is broken and we have to move to another gate. 50 minutes of sitting on the runway with no plan to get off the plane.
887,"  Miami to Paris. I would like to say thank you to Godfrey a supervisor in the reservation service department for assisting me with my reservation after having the worst experience with a representative on the phone. After having doubts why I became an Aviator Advantage member when I spoke with Godfrey he made all my traveling plans at ease, Thank you once again."
888,"  London to Miami. On Saturday flew AA39 and had the most uncomfortable flight ever, have been flying with American Airlines for over 25 years and clocked over 1 million miles. Legroom has been reduced and the seats slope down so arrived in Miami with a back ache. The crew were dong their best but must be demoralized by have to work with such a poor product. Will have to endure the return trip but probably the last time I fly with AA."
889,"  Chicago to Vancouver. Incredibly bad service. The cabin was cold. Flight attendant made no effort to address this when requested. Flight attendant disappeared to the back of the plane. Never came by after the first 1/2 hour to see if there were any client needs.  Flight attendant looked disheveled. Torn stockings. Chewing gum. When she finally showed up at the end of the flight and took her seat, she sat down, chewing her gum, focused on her cell phone.  No hello or goodbye on entry/exit. Suggestion, in these times of competition for customer dollars, a little bit of 4-seasons training for this employee would be a great idea. As an employer, I would have instantly terminated her."
890,Not Verified |  Baltimore Washington to Charlotte. Every time I fly with American Airlines  they have a “maintenance issue”. I should have learned my lesson. I try to avoid using them. I went for the direct flight and they lived up to my fear and cancelled my flight They are not worth booking flights with. They always have delays and inconveniences. I feel sorry for those who have to work the front lines and deal with customers. I will not fly American Airlines again!
891,  Oklahoma City to Los Angeles. We showed up at 0440 for our 0610 flight only to make it to baggage check in to be told that because we checked our bags at 0516 that we were too late to check in because we were having to wait in line because they didn't have enough attendants to help everyone. They told us to stand to the side waiting even longer I helped just to find out had they did their job we should have boarded.  My first and last time flying American Airlines never again. They just rebooked us on a full flight telling us maybe we would get on. 
892,"Not Verified |  I had to purchase a new outgoing ticket due to scheduling conflicts. Not a single customer service representative mentioned anything i had to do to maintain my return flight. I verified that flight time, bought a new ticket and went on my trip. Only to discover, when I tried to fly home they had cancelled my reservation. There were still open seats on that flight but they refused to honor my ticket because I had been unable to make the initial flight. They were incredibly unhelpful, unsympathetic, and rude about the entire thing and wanted me to pay an additional 400$ for a ticket on a flight i had already booked and paid for weeks in advance. I will not be flying this airline again"
893,"  Detroit to Chicago. I find it incredibly unaccomodating that I was told I could not be given a seat next to my husband even if there was one available, because they were not to accommodate someone with basic economy."
894,"  Frankfurt to New York. This was a great flight. I went from/to Frankfurt and New York. Their generosity with the food they present was great for such a long flight. We had a drink, then a snack, then lunch, then another snack and drinks one last time. The seats were very comfortable and the entertainment kept me awake throughout the entire flight. LOL that is usually hard because I dislike watching anything! But, they had new movies and I enjoyed it all in all! Not to forget, the landings were perfect! "
895,"  Honolulu to Dallas. The flight listed I didn't even make because this airline chose to overbook and make early online check in impossible for my class, the site quite literally read ""we currently don't have enough seats to assign one to you now, please check in upon arrival at airport for seat assignment"". I was using transportation provided by the airport so had no control over my arrival time, I did arrival an hour early and got denied a place so my flight got bumped. Didn't read anywhere that seats were first come first serve, would've booked Delta had I known. I've currently been stuck in the airport 8 hours and will be arriving 6 after my expected arrival time, absolutely outrageous. The American Airlines employee response to my ""inconvenience"" was ""well, this change won't be charged, and at least you'll make it home""....Are you kidding?! I didn't book the flight I got stuck on purely for the inconvenience to me, and round trip means you get to go home. She had the audacity to claim it could be worse and they could make me pay for their lack organization and counting skills, it's not that difficult American Airlines, simply count the seats on your airplane and stop selling tickets when you hit that number, account for the pilot and any staff needed on board, believe it or not it's that simple. They did provide a $12 food voucher at the airport that was only brought to my attention by another passenger who got bumped, not even an airline employee, nice gesture but doesn't make up for the 14 hours of my life I won't get back. Yes American Airlines that's math you've obviously not seen it before. Ridiculous."
896,"Not Verified |  
Portland to Los Angeles. Traveling for a family emergency, so I booked last minute and my best option was to travel via American Airlines. My flight out of Portland was delayed, as is my connecting flight (1.5 hrs so far). The aircraft I traveled in was extremely dirty, making my experience much more unpleasant. Customer service does not seem to care. Will never travel American Airlines ever again. The level of customer service is not up to par with other airlines like Delta and Alaska."
897," Cancun to St. Louis via Chicago. There was air traffic/ground traffic causing me to miss my connecting flight which I had a 2.5 hour window to make. I was told that the airline does not supply hotel vouchers or even meal vouchers because the plane landed on time there was just traffic on the ground so we couldn’t get off the plane. Nothing was done besides handing me a slip of paper to sleep in the airport or pay for an hotel when clearly it was out of my control. The customer service reps were entirely to rude. No to mention my flight was delayed according to my text alert but they closed the doors 15 mins early so I still could not board. I have no idea where my luggage is. The customer service reps were rude, and could care less about helping me find a comfortable place, I sucked up the fact that I was staying in the airport overnight after travels literally all day and asked for directions to the military USO. A place I knew I could sleep comfortably, the custome assistance rep responded “I don’t know it’s somewhere in here” and proceeded to talk to her co worker. I was told multiple times that’s it was not the airlines fault that I missed the connecting flight and policy is not the accommodate me. Which is ridiculous! I did not fly the plane I did not cause the traffic jam, how is the airline not at fault? I was not pointing the finger, but at 2300hrs after traveling for over 13 hours I just wanted to lay down or even someone to speak to who respected me as a person instead of a burden on their job. The next morning after sleeping in the USO I eventually located I headed to my gate which was printed on the ticket. Only 30 mins before boarding I realized the screen had not changed to my final destination. After checking the main listing of of flights and gates screen, I found my gate had changed without notification whatsoever, and it was on the complete opposite side of the airport. The whole airline experience was horrible! I will never fly this airline again, not even if it were $1 per flight. The customer service needs a serious retrain on quality customer care! 0 out of 10"
898,"Not Verified |  Unfortunately there are times when I have no choice but to fly American. Flight booked from Austin to Salt Lake City with layover in Phoenix. Per usual the flight is delayed. I get into Phoenix with just enough time to run across this ridiculously designed shit hole airport. I make a quick stop at customer service asking them to let them know I'm coming as fast as I can. She said she would and as I run off I hear her coworker mumble under her stinky breath that ""they've already given your seat to someone else"". I get there and the door is shut 2 minutes before it's supposed to be. In fact they bumped me from boarding in group 4 to group 8 on a flight that leaves 5 hours later. I've said it before and I'll say it again. Only fools fly American. I will no longer be a fool. I'll quit my job before I fly American again."
899,"Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Philadelphia. American Airlines is horrible. We heard that on our nine hour flight there would only be be overhead screens, I downloaded the AA app that would have free movies for on the flight. The inside of the aircraft looked new in the business cabin but was 1990 style in the economy cabin, when the flight took off I heard that the app would not work. The attendant said that I could read a book. Shortly after all the lights turned off (not a night flight) and I couldn’t read. Horrible airline!"
900,"  A special flight, where I found the flight crew acted as though they enjoyed their job. I was afraid that the way I used to fly had disappeared where the passengers were respected, greeted with a smile. The flight attendants were dressed sharply, proud to wear American's uniform. It was a sight from the past. I traveled 1/16/19 On American flight# 1351, 11:42 am from Tampa to DFW."
901,"  I was scheduled to leave at 1230pm, arrive in Dallas, Tx. at 400ish and leave there and arrive in Lubbock at 545. Well, both flights leaving Dallas were canceled due to weather. Misi was working the gate and informed me of this information. She rescheduled me for a direct fight that leaves at 730pm. She explained the benefits and draw back of not only this option but with several other options she presented me. She did this with a very genuine, sincere smile on her face. She is very pleasant and treated me with empathy and sincere interest in me.  Thanks for the great service."
902,"  Puerto Vallarta to Phoenix. American Airlines is utterly incompetent! A month before our departure to Puerto Vallarta, we are informed that our original flight has been cancelled, and we need to take the return flight a day earlier. Our hotel has already been paid and is non-refundable. So, the vacation is a now a day shorter, and we are out a few hundred dollars. Upon arrival in the PV airport to return home, the flight has been delayed two hours, and we will miss the connecting flight, requiring an overnight stay in PHX. Originally we were told it was due to weather, but the incoming flight is sitting in Phoenix with clear skies. After asking them to double check the reason, we are told it is for scheduled maintenance. What? Scheduled maintenance when you have a flight booked? Well, after spending two hours on the phone, we have been re-assigned to fly on a different airline. No offer for reimbursement for the flight difference, and an extra $100 charge to check bags on a different airline. They might as well tell you to get lost. "
903,"  Oakland to Montego Bay via Phoenix / Charlotte. I recently traveled on American Airlines on several flights over a period of a few days. After booking, I read lots of bad reviews about AA. My experience with AA was great! All six flights were on time. The staff at the gate and on the plane were friendly and helpful. The pilot kept us informed when we were about to experience turbulence. Overall a great experience!"
904,"  Albany to Columbus via Philadelphia. This is by far the worst experience that I have ever had with an airline. I had a flight delay leaving my original location from a business trip due to air traffic. After arriving in Philadelphia, I had less than 5 minutes to run from terminal F to terminal B to reach my connecting flight. I gave it my best effort to make it, but sadly missed the flight by only a minute or so. I approached customer service who told me the the next flight to my location was the following morning. I informed them that I was flexible on airport locations, and that I would be willing to fly into any airport in Ohio. They were quite rude in informing me that I had no time to make the next flight to Cleveland, so I had no choice but to wait. I asked about hotel accommodations, to which they said that they only offered a discounted rate, however, if I would like to sleep in the airport, there were cots. I called about the rates and found nothing cheaper than $100 + tax. I decided to sleep in the airport, however I was informed later that there were no cots, and the airport had stopped providing them some time ago. After asking around, my only option was a small pillow and blanket and to find a ""comfy"" spot in the airport. Overall, I found American Airlines to be extremely unprofessional and unwilling to accommodate, despite the fact this was no fault of my own, but rather a fault of the airline. I will not be flying with American Airlines again and do not recommend them."
905,  Dallas to Saint Louis. The worst airline ever. Very rude people. I sat in airport 14 hours. Got shuffled from plane to plane which both was broken missed 2 flights. Cause of the plane issues was never once told sorry. Was very confused on what was going on. Never again will I fly with them.
906,"  Missoula to Indianapolis via Dallas (Abilene). Horrible,  delay, added City layover, added day to US only flight, 2 gate changes. Complaints - no food available due to rerouting to non 24 hour airport, airplane toilet not working part of one flight, airplane toilet not working entire portion of one flight. No Water on one flight - very, very, very long tarmac delay. Delay almost 2 hours in Missoula with 11 passenger reduction to take on addition fuel additional flight time to be rerouted to non 24 hour airport"
907,  New York JFK to Madrid. Worst customer service ever. Hiring rude employees who are not at all accommodating or helpful is the exact opposite service you advertise. The woman at check in was rude from the beginning of the conversation to the very end when she was explaining what is an allotted check in bag and what is not. How do you expect to keep up with competing airlines when the forefront of your company sets such an awful tone?
908,Not Verified |  Philadelphia to San Juan. American delayed our flight due to “maintenance issues” 20 minutes before we were supposed to board. That delay caused us to miss our connecting flight in San Juan. We had to pay $340 with another carrier to change our missed flight. American refuses to reimburse our money. They said they can’t “guarantee arrival times“. I will never fly them again. Terrible customer service. To me they should be responsible when the flight is delayed for mechanical maintenance issues!
909,"  Mexico City to Jacksonville via Dallas. Worst experience I’ve ever had. First they make me buy another ticket for me and two other family members, then they delay my flight from DFW for more then two hours because the plane was not working properly. Thanks to this I missed an important meeting at work ."
910,Not Verified |  The flight was delayed for 9 hours. There was no compensation offered that was comparable to that of the hotel and event tickets that had expired upon our landing. The entire AA staff was apathetic - they couldn't even bother getting us vouchers for restaurants or lounge seats. The best they could conjure were some complimentary AA branded warm sandwiches and stale chips for our 9 hour wait.
911," We flew American Airlines from Dallas Fort-Worth to Las Vegas. Our flight was delayed by an hour and the gate changed to a different terminal. When we got onboard, the friendly flight attendants welcomed us and led us to our seats. The Boeing 787 was very new, clean and spacious. The seat was comfortable and the IFE system was excellent! They served two drink services during the 2 hour flight and they served pretzels about 3 times. Overall I wouldn’t hesitate to fly American again."
912,  Richmond to Charlotte. Original flight through PHL was cancelled due to mechanical problems but alternative arrangements were just fine. It's when things go wrong that airline service is truly revealed. I was very pleased with my rebooking and the service I received. I found the American Airlines app helpful. American Airlines made a great vacation possible and I am looking forward to doing it again. Nothing to complain about!
913," Frankly the worst airline and a disgrace to the American people for calling themselves American Airlines. They are a horrible representation of our country with their lack of service, lack of care or accountability. My flight from SJC to a connecting flight at LAX landed late. 10mins before the gate was scheduled to close, we were told that our gate had changed. We took off later because we had to wait for passengers to disembark first. At LAX, we taxied for 20mins before the captain decided to inform us of the delay from traffic and light rain. My layover was only 50mins so I only had 10mins to get to my gate by the time I disembarked. I informed ground staff about this to which they just pointed to a massive line at gate 52G which required a bus transfer to Terminal 4. There were many in line who had a connecting flight from LAX to HKG, like myself, but they did nothing to ensure we would make the flight. When myself and others arrived at the gate, AA staff simply shrugged and pointed us to customer service who gave many of the customers attitude. I was ""lucky"" enough to be booked onto the next flight 24hrs later w/ a hotel. The next day I confirmed with AA staff at the gate twice and customer service that my checked baggage would be on board. They all confirmed, however, it never made it onboard. I had to call incessantly to finally have them track my bag. I finally received my bag 4 days later with items stolen...Lastly, the boarding pass says ""gate closes 10mins before flight"". AA staff at LAX tried to board us an hour early and close the gate 30mins before takeoff."
914,"  Miami to New York. Worst experience flying ever. I took this airline to get from Montreal to Lima and back, and on the way one flight was delayed 17h because of mechanical issues before finally getting cancelled which made us miss our 2 connecting flights. The first connection was replaced because it was the same airline, but they didn’t care at all when we called them about the last flight which was booked with LATAM Peru. On the way back security ran very long cuz of government shut down so we only got to our plane 1 minute before the doors closed and we were told that we couldn’t get on and that our seats had been given to someone else. On the way our trip took 48h instead of 16h (and we had to pay for another ticket which later lead to more complications) and on the way back we are currently on stand by but doesn’t seem like we are getting on a flight any time soon. I have never dealt with customer service people that cared less about your situation and had such little empathy especially after Everything they made us go through on the way to Lima and now on the way back as well. Terrible airline, terrible service 0% recommend!"
915," 
American Airlines is absolutely the worst airline I have ever traveled through. Every single flight through them was delayed on the trip I had today except the final destination flight at the end of the night, and the cabin service refused to even call the other flight to let them know they had connecting members. This is the worst service I’ve seen in any industry ever, and I will never fly American Airlines again."
916,"  Norfolk to Honolulu via Dallas Ft Worth. Best Flight Attendants I've ever had, they took time for questions they were beyond kind and made sure accommodations were comfortable, they were courteous professionals. Prices are great, Entertainment, and staff is just amazing. I can say that from here on out I'll continue to be a loyal AA customer and I hope this review reaches the staff attending flight A5 from DFW to HNL and AA1998. "
917," Atlanta to Boston via Charlotte. Absolutely nothing wrong with the in-flight product on this domestic connecting flight. It was an older plane, so seat pitch and recline were reasonable. I suspect the newer layout would be less comfortable. Staff were friendly. Unfortunately they wanted $75pp to be put on the standby list for the sooner connecting flight, which seemed unreasonable as it would only save us 1 hour. Their hold times for phone service were ridiculous (45min+)."
918,"  Amazing how a crew can make a difference in flying the same route. We flew from Barcelona to Miami on Dec 31st on an 777-200. The plane was old but the crew was excellent (flight 113) and in the 9 hour flight we received a pretty good lunch preceded by drinks first and during the flight the crew did not stop passing around snacks and drinks. Shortly before landing we were served a hot snack. On the flight back (112) the crew was rude, hurrying to serve the dinner and then disappeared (the sat on the back of the plane were there were free seats and watched tv or did some knitting!) and never came through the cabin again (seats were full of waste) until the very poor breakfast which they served in a hurry. The plane was far from old and the temperature couldn't be regulated (it was freezing all flight) and there was a terrible noise (a kind of alarm triggered 1 hour before landing) which felt really annoying if not scary."
919,"  New York JFK to Buenos Aires. Very fast check in at terminal 8. Business class lounge ample with good selection of food and drink. First on board. Was offered champagne in a plastic cup followed by newspapers, etc. 10pm flight, not full, departed the gate 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Business class seats comfortable although I do not like the backward facing one I got - not shown on the seat map when I booked - beware. Dinner was rushed through, not very appetizing, but wines good. Got the impression, as usual, that the crew wanted to get on with their rest and ignore the passengers/ customers. Breakfast option of Chili Omelette was weird, to say the least, and not appropriate for most passengers, plus served less than 45 minutes before landing and therefore extremely hurried. No chance of a second cup of coffee. Fruit plate was barely acceptable as most of the fruit was not ripe. In sum, have been on more pleasant transatlantic AA flights with better much service and much better food. Seemed like a different airline. IFE was OK, no current movies, but live TV goo"
920,"  Houston to Vail via Dallas Ft Worth. This entire trip was one nightmare after another. On my outbound flight, I sat in the plane at the gate for over 2 hours for a maintenance issue involving some kind of latch in the cargo area. That was frustrating, but I would prefer the plane be safe prior to takeoff, so I accepted it and moved on. My return trip was one issue after another. I was notified of a 2 hour delay about 5 hours prior to the scheduled departure time. While I was never given a formal reason for this original delay, it was suspected to be as a result of weather in other parts of the country. I was understanding but still needed to know how to handle the ticket for my missed connection flight. The attendant at the desk advised me to still remain on this flight and the connection ticket would be handled for me once it was ""officially missed."" I did so and continued waiting. The plane was delayed for a little longer than originally planned but it did finally arrive at the airport. Unfortunately, yet another plane had maintenance issues and the delay was extended by another 1.5 hours for them to check it out. The departure time was 4 hours and 17 minutes late. I had been rescheduled onto several intermediate flights but, ultimately, missed all connections due to another delay upon arrive at DFW - we were not able to get to a gate so we were waiting in the holding box for an additional 20 minutes. I was finally booked onto the last flight between Dallas and Houston for the night, so I went to the gate to wait the 1.5 hours. While waiting, the flight was ""delayed"" by 30 minutes, and the shortly after that announcement, it was cancelled altogether. After waiting in line at the AA customer service desk for 30 minutes, I was informed that they had not scheduled a flight crew for that flight, which is why it was cancelled. So I had to be put up in a hotel and fly out the following morning. The airline dropped the ball in numerous ways, but the poor state of their planes is the most concerning. I finally contacted them after it was all finished and requested compensation for the nightmare that I went through and the airline offered me a $100 ""goodwill"" voucher to fly American again in the next 12 months. I do not accept that as sufficient compensation so I continued emailing back and forth, ultimately ending with a phone call from corporate customer relations saying that this was all that I was entitled to since they provided the service that I paid for - a flight between the two destinations. I am shocked that multiple delays and hours spent in airports waiting for their mechanics to get the planes in fit condition to fly amounts to $100 on an airline that I have no intention of ever flying again if there is any alternative. I've flown Spirit airlines multiples times and had better customer service than American provided. I advise you to steer clear and avoid American Airlines if at all possible. I could have driven the 1200 miles and gotten home before I did by flying."
921,"  Savannah to Miami. Flight delayed repeatedly, for more than five hours, how is it possible to make any connections. Extra fees for everything, checked bags, drinks, snacks, headphones. How does this airline compete on the global market. "
922,"  Kauai to Detroit via Los Angeles / Charlotte. We used our loyalty program to book tickets with American. United is the hub where we live, but we have chosen American for what used to be its service. The program apparently has so many rules that when we arrived in Charlotte, NC trying to get back to Detroit, there was an earlier flight. American would not allow us to get on the flight even though the plane was half full. The company preferred to make its loyal customers wait for six hours until its next, probably half full flight leaves for Detroit. I waited at the gate for the agent who never showed. The pilot, who was waiting too, politely told me that I could go to the customer service desk to get help. When I arrived there, two of my original five passengers were somehow on this flight. Interesting that they had to fly back already allowing American to resell their seats, saving them two 850 vouchers at our original departure city. The agent at customer service told me I had to call a number to get help. The agent at the number couldn't help. But her supervisor at Dallas Fort Worth asked why I hadn't talked to a supervisor at the gate. I politely told her that I was told to call this number. She told me we could fly standby but the agent had to reset her documentation which is fine print for not wanting to take the heat. Every single time each employee said they couldn't break the rules - he/she was not going to get written up for breaking the rules. I wonder when helping loyal customers became breaking rules. Sounds like this organization needs to reorganize around its central service orientation: people. Looks like I wont be choosing American over other airlines anymore. Loyalty program beware."
923,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Corpus Christi. Our plane couldn't land because the taxi runway was still taken up, because of this I missed my connecting flight, I was supposed to be home before noon, instead I'm spending my entire afternoon in the DFW terminal having to buy overpriced food and American Airlines refused to refund any portion of my trip even though it's their fault I didn't make it home on time."
924,"  Guadalajara to Dallas Ft Worth. Flying AA in economy (Booked using BA Avios) you must purchase your checked in luggage at the check in. This caused insane mess and it took ages. Check in agent then informed us that we are not seating together and offered to seat us together at the cost. This is a blatant extortion! Besides, this is completely unsafe practice, as in case of an accident split families will look for one another putting the whole evacuation at the jeopardy, but i guess for AA it's only $$$ that matter. Safety is overrated. Staff ground as well as flight crew, not a friendly bone in their body. Service is fast and efficient though, but might as well be performed by robots."
925,"  Los Angeles to London. Another deeply disappointing experience with American, and this time it involves an illegal, deceptive sales method. Purchased a so-called ""basic economy"" ticket from LAX to Bucharest at a not so basic price. This allows me to check in 24-hours in advance and obtain the best seats then available. Was unable to check-in online and was told it is because I am flying on BA to Romania. Romania is a EC member-country just like France, England, & Germany and also does not require a visa of US-citizens, so I do not understand this pretext. I was told to drive out to LAX and check-in tomorrow when there is nothing left but middle seats in the back. I protested and then learnt the real reason my check-in is restricted: they advised me to purchase seat assignments online for more than $100. When I protested further the agent told me it was my own fault for buying ""basic economy,"" but I responded that the real error here is patronising American Airlines. This is what is called by the FTC ""bait-and-switch"" and it is illegal. I am dreading this trip now because of this and the 3-hour connexion on BA - the last time I flew AA to London and then a BA flight to Düsseldorf my suitcase was delayed for two hours but it took BA five days to bring it to me and by that time I was on my way back to the airport to continue my journey - they then tried to negotiate me down on my modest interim expenses. I advise you to save yourself anguish, headaches, and ""American-""style service (that means discourtesy all around and bitter stewardesses with chips on their shoulders) and fly a foreign carrier like KLM, Swissair, Lufthansa, or Austrian. You'll arrive happier and in good condition."
926," Montego Bay to Denver via Dallas. Worst customer service of any airline I have ever flown! Stark curtness and pure rudeness from the ticketing staff to the attendants. Must be a bad company to work for because every single staff member, on all legs of our trip, behaved like it was the worst day of their life. We felt as if we were inconveniencing everyone just by existing. This in turn, made this the most uncomfortable and unenjoyable journey of my life. We will continue to patronize our current favorite airline, Southwest, and avoid American Airlines at all costs! We will also be preaching to anyone who will listen about how horrible our experience was."
927," This is the first and last time I’d consider American Airlines. Flew San Diego to New York JFK. I was extremely uncomfortable this full 6 hour ride. The seats are extremely conjested and I felt very claustrophobic. I usually sleep any time on a plane but in no way could get comfortable on this flight. The seats are terrible, the TV screen is touching your nose, you get a coffee (drink) and cookie for you whole (6 hour in this case) flight (everything else costs something), and they said I’d have to pay another $70 if there was a free seat open next to my friend so I could sit with them. Any other air carrier easily allowed me to switch my seat for free if something were open the day of the flight in my same class. I paid the same price for so much more on Delta and Jetblue."
928,"  Portland to Phoenix. Disappointed with policies. Paid to upgrade to premium class, sat next to a big guy who was stuck in middle seat. All exit seats were open, asked to move back to the exit seat so we were all a bit more comfortable, but nope ""against the policies"". Won't fly this airline again if there are choices, clearly a corporate decision to take customer service and reasonable accommodation out of the employees hands. Disappointed with how far this airline has fallen!"
929,"  Seattle to Wilkes-Barre via Chicago. If you are able to, I would avoid American Airlines if it is possible for you to. First, the flight was delayed because their defroster wasn't working, which could have been avoided by them warming it while we were boarding, rather than waiting till we had been sitting for awhile to defrost it! So we sat there for about twenty minutes until they finally got their defroster out and then we had to wait another hour for them to fix the defroster. Because of this, I missed my connecting flight in Chicago. The only positive thing about American Airlines is that they re-booked my flight automatically after the delay. But the next flight wasn't for another seven hours! Then, once I boarded the next flight, we sat for an hour again because there was ""traffic"" from the other airplanes. American Airlines was just a mess as you can see. Not to mention, completely unprofessional. While on the first flight (flying to Chicago), I saw the flight attendant on his phone while he was supposed to be handing out refreshments to people and they were very lazy. Two of the three flight attendants sat for most of the flight. The woman who was in charge of boarding was very rude, and I ended up having to check my second carry-on bag because they are very strict about the dimensions. My bag barely was over the dimensions. Overall, it was a very bad experience and such an unprofessional environment, filled with many incompetent people. "
930,"  The worst traveling experience I have ever had. The flight started of by being delayed for about an hour then when I reach in Miami for my connections I had missed it due to the original delayed flight. Following this when I tried to go to the costumer service line it took them about an hour and forty five minutes to deal with the 8 people that were in front of me. Finally I make it to talk to the customer service desk and they tell me that they are not providing accommodations and that I will be stuck in Miami till the next morning. Although there was a flight leaving for Toronto in 45 minutes that they could’ve put me on which they didn’t. All in all this was one of the worst experiences I’ve had flying and I believe that it was handled very poorly by the people working at American Airlines, both in Miami and in Trinidad."
931,"Not Verified |  Detroit to Dallas. Horrible experience. I had to jump through many hoops in order to pay for my bag, and the agent helping me with it took so long that I almost missed my flight. When rushing to security I accidentally left my backpack at the counter and when I came back minutes later it was gone and the agent at the counter was extremely rude and unhelpful when I asked her if she had seen my backpack. At my gate I was practically yelled at by customer service for asking if they knew where my bag was. I also tried to call the airline to speak to someone in customer service to see if they had my backpack and was left ringing for 10 minutes before I finally hung up. Wish I could give them negative stars. "
932,"  After two weeks staying in Albuquerque, on Jan 2, our family of 6 was flying back to the East Coast on American Airlines. A snowstorm unexpectedly hit Albuquerque and Dallas, and the evening before our flight we got a phone call that it was canceled. I was very thankful for getting this information prior to arriving at the airport the next morning, and American was able to rebook us the following day on the exact same flights. Weather delays and issues arise, and as regular travelers, we understand this. My husband, four children, and I arrived at the Albuquerque airport about 20 minutes before 5 AM for our flight to Dallas that was at 6:45 (we like to hit security about an hour before our flight). There was already a very long line of about 150 people waiting to be checked in. Almost all of the kiosks were broken and not working and the ones that were working would not process our tickets because of the prior day's last minute flight changes from the airline. Our kiosk actually asked for us to get a worker to help us process our tickets at the kiosk, and when I asked the woman checking in kiosk bags if we should wait for her to help us, or if we should get in the line she started yelling at us to get on a different kiosk, that they don't all work out it wasn't her fault. I think they were maybe 3 working kiosks at that point. Only 2 workers were checking in standard tickets, 1 was 1st class only (and mostly standing doing nothing), and another was checking bags from the few who got the kiosks to work. After waiting in the line for over 2 hours, as we approached the front of the line, 1 of the desk workers began yelling at the crowd that it was our fault that we had missed our flights and we should have been there hours earlier. My husband responded to her and told her that the crowd had not all missed their flights because of being late but because of the inability of the airline to handle the delays from the day before. She began screaming at us that we should all know to arrive over 3hrs early for any flight. That maybe recreational travelers don't understand these things. The entire crowd of now 250 people behind us yelled wow at her and she proceeded to turn to the security guard and make a comment about having my husband removed. Thankfully the security guard shook his head no at her. She told us that it was all over the website that we needed to be there over 3 hrs early. When looking at the website to verify, there was no mention of needing to be there 3hrs prior and nothing under the alert section either. I believe there were well over 300 people waiting in line to check in at one point. Once we got to the counter almost an hour after our flight was supposed to leave, we were refused ticketed seats for the 6 of us on flights and put on standby rather than give a new tickets because this was ""our fault"" for missing the flight. They also tried to make us pay $250 a ticket to get new flights because again it was ""our fault"" and not theirs. The six of us entered security at 7:40, (exited it less than 8 minutes later), after being at the airport almost exactly 3 hours. While I'm very thankful for the gate workers along the way who found creative ways to get us home, ABQ AA needs a new ticket counter staff. We will not fly with AA again."
933,  Amsterdam to Philadelphia. On the way to Philadelphia : - entertainment system old fashioned monitors - none of the handsets worked so we were unable to listen to the shown movies - food that was distributed was below any quality - leg space for my length 1 meter 90 a disaster in the aisle seats on the floor there are boxes for the non working communication system that take 25% of the space to put your legs. The way back with even older 767-300 - entertainment system did not work at all - we skipped the meal - we tried the “continental breakfast “ which is just a complete joke how can you screw up yoghurt? - seats are uncomfortable and old.
934," Lafayette to Portland via Dallas. Absolutely terrible, poorly organized staff and files, will lie on reports to ensure you cannot get compensation for issues they caused. My first flight was delayed by over an hour due to another plane making an emergency landing on my flights runway, and they wrote it down as 'weather delay' because they knew if they did I would not get compensation for a hotel when I inevitably missed my connecting flight. They also constantly demand you check your carry on because they don't allocate enough space for them on flight. Overall the worst flying experience I have had to date, I would steer clear of them if you value your time and money."
935,Not Verified |  My husband and I were flying to our tropical honeymoon. Our flight was supposed to leave at 5:38 AM so we had to be the airport by 3:30 for international flight. Our flight was extremely delayed and we missed our connection to our destination. They tried to reroute us however every time the flight got delayed and we missed every connection. Sitting on the tarmac for over 5 1/2 hours waiting for the plane to be fixed. Finally after it was fixed we got to Charlotte where they directed us to Miami and then to our destination. However we were supposed to arrive at 3 o’clock we didn’t arrive until well after midnight. we missed a complete day at our resort and I was out a lot of money. The next few days we tried to recuperate we were on able to experience any of the excursions we had planned. Upon my arrival back home to the states I contacted American Airlines where they have the following to say “ we apologize for this inconvenience however we will give you $100 credit each for this inconvenience please note they do expire within a year”. My husband and I almost never travel and we blew all vacation time to do this trip with one another. I am beside myself with regret and anger towards this airlines and the fact that they would not help me beyond this hundred dollar credit voucher.  It would’ve been better if these would never expire since in 2019 we cannot take anymore time off. They should’ve put us on a different flight to begin with or had a top priority to get the flight fixed.
936,"Not Verified |  New York to Nasville. I was not notified until just a few hours before my flight that they had too much weight on the flight. So instead of notifying me earlier, it was more so last minute. Then, they let us go down the terminal ramp to the plane, and another American airlines employee rudeley told us to go back up the ramp. The employees were very slow at rebooking and we even saw them send another couple to baggage claim to get their bags instead of checking the gate they were at, (which the bags were actually at that gate). Very disorganized airline. This will be the absolute last time flying with them ever again."
937,"  Reno to Phoenix via Yuma. I paid over 1,100.00 for 2 round trip tickets for my son and I to visit my husband living in Reno for work. The dates were Dec 26th - Jan 2. I was bumped off both directions to a later flight. Luckily, I purchased flight insurance for this possibility. I still paid even more to check 2 bags each way. That is a ridiculous amount to pay and get bumped off both flights. I arrived this morning at Reno/Tahoe at 5 Am for a flight after 6 Am and there was nobody at the counter to check me in. That's not acceptable. Specially paying over $1,100.00. I could have bought a used car and drove home for that much money."
938,Not Verified |  Albuquerque to Rochester via Chicago. Our initial flight home was booked for 1/1/19 on AA1431 at 6:54am. American Airline canceled our flight on 1/1 gave us a rebook on 1/2. Then once again canceled our flight 1/2 as well. These cancellations provided us with hardship. No place to stay. No reimbursement or food voucher or free tickets. They canceled us twice and we are stranded fending for our selves. They did not even give us option to fly sooner than. 48 hours is way too long to be stuck somewhere unplanned with children in tow!
939,"  Cancun to Dallas Ft Worth. Due to bad weather in the US, our return flight from Mexico to DFW was cancelled - this is not what I'm upset about. My concern is how we were treated. There was NO airline rep at the gate, and we were told over the PA to go to another gate for ""more info"", which they never communicated what was going on or how we would book another flight. We had to go back through customs and they transported all passengers to different resorts for the night (I do appreciate the accommodation), but still, no information on how to secure new flights. Not everyone had international phone service if they even had a personal phone, and, the resort didn't have a way to get online and book a new flight. The app said ""no flights available"", and if you tried calling AA, you would get hung up on. After 1.5 hours on hold, we were able to secure a flight. AA should have re-booked everyone before we were transported away from the airport. I was traveling with a group of 10, including 2 in a wheelchair. Once we made it to DFW, our flight to Kansas City was ""oversold"", even though we had tickets and the agent at the gate was very rude and not empathetic, nor did she communicate what was going on. I was told ""you should thank this man for giving up his seat for you"" - really? This is not how you treat customers. I submitted a compliant, and they said they were ""sorry for the weather, outside of their control"", and I responded that is not what I was complaining about, and they sent another response back saying ""it's not their policy to compensate""...again, that is not what I was looking for. I just wanted to provide feedback so they have an opportunity to not lose any more customers. I will never fly with American Airlines again. I should have stuck with my old faithful and reliable Southwest Airlines"
940,"  London to Montreal via Chicago. American Airlines do not respect schedule, they made me miss my flight to Montreal through Chicago, no support no nothing on new years eve. I will never travel this airline again."
941," Dallas to New York JFK. After working nonstop to be able to fly for New Years to see my family and friends. I was meeting a friend in NY for a day and a half to spend there. American Airlines decides to canceled my flight less than 12 hours before. Their explanations was because the plane of my flight was canceled at his first destination. They scheduled me for 2 days after and I changed it for the next day. I missed my day in NY, the whole reason I did this trip. Never getting a flight with American Airlines."
942,"  American Airline is the worst for seating. We purchased tickets from San Francisco to Charlotte over a month ago and our flight on the way and returning, did not have seats next to each other. When parties book very expensive plane tickets, they assumed they’ll be set together. Don’t count on it with American Airlines."
943,"  Kona to Washington via Los Angeles. I really enjoyed my flight with American Airlines, everything that could go right did go right. My plane left on time for both flights and the staff seemed to go out of their way to make sure everyone had a great flight. They frequently made rounds throughout the cabin but could tell if you did not want to be bothered. My seat was pretty comfortable and I had enough space to be comfortable. I was surprised how comfort the seat was since I am 6 feet tall and usually find economy seats to be very cramped. The only problem I had with my seat was, the USB port on the A321 did not work."
944,  New York to Kingston via Miami. Horrible customer service. Want computers to do their job for them. 4 hour delay for maintenance. Slept in Miami airport overnight for them to tell me I have to pay $150 for my carry on bag after it was already carried on to my first flight. All about money. No respect from either rep at airport or supervisor. Demanding more money. Had to throw out my brand new carry on bag. Called 1-800 rep she said for me to keep receipts for refunds because supervisor at airport is incorrect. Most frustrating service ever and I fly often.
945,"  Burlington to Pensacola return via Charlotte. We attempted to check in on the kiosk only to find we were not seated together. We had to pay $60.00 to get seated together and they would not assign seats for our connecting flight or give any gate information for our connecting flight! So at each Gate we had to ask for seat assignments only to be told to wait and wait and wait until just before boarding! At one time we were told we were on standby, yet we were holding tickets. All the gate attendants treated us like we were an annoyance to them (with the exception of the BTV attendant). We will never fly on American Airlines again. We even observed them split of a mother and two small children, a father and two small children and many couples - placing them randomly throughout the plane and telling them they would have to barter to sit next to each other! The most inefficient way I have ever seen to assign seats and board people."
946,"  Boise to Phoenix. Let's put a screen in the back of every seat. And, just as passengers begin to fall asleep let's pump loud, obnoxious ads into their faces preventing from sleeping because we won't let them be allowed to control the screen or volume and be forced  to continue to listen to our ads for credit, food and movies over and over. And don't forget the bag of broken up stale pretzels. I'll never fly American again."
947, Charlotte to Tulsa. American Airlines is the worst airline to fly with. Everytime there is a 1-5 hour layover. They overbook the flights and have 0 customer service. I will be choosing a different airline in the future because this airline is never going to get me to my final destination on time!
948,  Knoxville to Charlotte. I missed my flight due to the slow understaffed check-In and TSA. I got to the airport more more than an hour in advance and was forced to stand for an entire hour. The TSA line was unreal and none of the staff was kind. Along with my self 9 others missed this flight. The staff was so rude and they closed the door in our face.
949,"Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Dallas via Columbia. I don't know where to begin because I had so many problems with American Airlines. Flight from Las Vegas to Dallas canceled. Was given alternate flight to Chicago - Charlotte - Columbia. Landed in Chicago only to be told flight to Charlotte had also been canceled. I went to AA Customer Relations and spoke to extremely rude agent. No flights out of Chicago so ended up spending the night in the airport. AA provided ""hotel discount coupon"" which was useless since hotels were already booked. No food voucher provided. I did not have a carry on bag due to AA's policy for economy travelers, I asked that my checked bag be brought to me so I could get my medication. My checked bag was located in Philadelphia even though I had no connections in Philadelphia. The next day, my flight to Columbia, SC was diverted to Charleston. Finally made it to Columbia after 28.5 hours only to find that my checked bag had made it to Columbia hours earlier. So AA can get your checked luggage to destination sooner than passengers. Makes absolutely no sense."
950,"Not Verified |  Seattle to Aruba via Philadelphia. I was at the airport early. I checked in with no one in front of me. My luggage was checked in right away with no issues. So when I arrived in Aruba, there was no luggage. I was told it was still in Philly and it would be sent to Miami and then onto Aruba. Well the next day it was till in Philly and it was going to be sent from Philly. I finally received it about 7:00pm . Really disappointed in AA."
951,"Not Verified |  Dallas to San Diego. The day after Christmas, there was a storm in Dallas so our plane was delayed. The problem was that when finally boarded for the third time and got to the runway, it was announced that it was cancelled so that another group of travelers could board our plane and go to LA along with our luggage, which they said they couldn’t take off the plane. We were left in the terminal, without luggage for three days. Who does this!"
952, Flew American Airlines from Dallas to Boston. My flight has been delayed for the past two and half hours. We aren’t getting proper reasons for the delay and still they are asking us to wait. This is our last flight for Boston from Dallas after which we may need to catch new flight the next day in case of cancellation. Very poor response from the team. Also they keep on changing terminals.
953,"  Philadelphia to San Diego. Very disappointed! My flight was from Philadelphia to San Diego on Thursday December 20th, gate A2. We were a group of five, my mother (a senior), me and my 2 children ( age 6 and 4) and my youngest sister. Unfortunately our seats were randomly assigned and not close to each other, so I decided to speak to the agents at the gate to help me sit at least with my kids together. I approached the guy at the gate in a very nice way and I asked him if he can help me with seats. I was shocked because of his unprofessional attitude! Instead of answering my request, he pointed at me with his fingers and asked to go ahead and board to the airplane! I repeated my question again and he started yelling at me.  I boarded with my kids and family, me and my 6 years old  had to sit by ourselves in different places, I asked the flight attendant if they had any open seats, she said yes, we have 20 open seats so I managed to sit at least with my son! I don’t usually post bad reviews unless it’s really bad! I was shocked by his attitude and poor behavior. American Airlines are losing hundreds of customers due to bad customer services. They really need to work on training their staff on how to do their job in a professional way. This person could’ve been able to help me but instead, he decided to act like this with a customer. Last time with AA for sure! I don’t recommend them, instead, Jet blue are much better and more professional."
954,"  Chicago to Knoxville. I am appalled at the service American Airlines offered. They canceled my flight from Chicago to Knoxville at the last minute. We were literally about to board, 20 minutes later than they originally told us. After the cancellation, they offered us zero help. They said our flight could not be rebooked and that we would have to leave Mmuch later than expected. They also refused to pay for a room for us to stay in, even though it was their fault. There were also little to no seats on the flights we needed; therefore, our traveling group had to be broken up and we had to make complex arrangements to get back to where we actually needed. For example, we wanted to fly to Knoxville but we ended up having to fly to Chattanooga. We then had to ask someone to drive all the way there to pick us up and bring us back to Knoxville. There workers/company has given us no help and is pretty much clueless about most of our questions. They didn't even know how we were supposed to get our luggage back. I am very disappointed in this and I plan on only using Delta flight services in the future."
955,  Austin to Phoenix. My original flight was for Friday around 6 am on December 28th. The customer service swore there were no other flights to get me out on that same day so they got me on a flight for the 29th. Already one day taken away from my trip I was made but was willing to work with it. They have now delayed my flight on the 29th by 5 hours and are hesitant to work with me in getting onto a quicker flight to get me out of here. I have spoken to many people and no one has been helpful. I will never fly this airline again and will stick to Southwest Airlines which is always faithful and I have never had any issues with.
956,Not Verified | Dallas to Atlanta. Horrible experience. Delays after delays and on top of that a bunch of attitude. Made us check our small bag in when ones clearly larger than ours was put overhead. Never again. Thanks American for reassuring me that Delta is the way to travel. Never had delays or snobby employees with Delta.
957,"Not Verified | London Heathrow to Mexico City via Dallas. Our trip was a shocking state of affairs. Understandably there had been terrible weather which knocked everything back. So we took off 4.5 hours late, went to New York instead of Dallas and missed our connecting flight to Mexico City not great but I was happy to chalk it up to a bad luck. And admittedly the staff on the flight were brilliant, very kind and tried everything to help everyone on the flight. The ground staff however were absolutely vile. I’ve never seen people treated like that in my life let alone in airport related problems. When one woman from AA was “doing her job” and asking people if they needed help with anything she would listen to their questions and then be so patronising and unhelpful that it then put people off asking her questions as they feared to be verbally abused by this member of staff. The attitude from the AA staff on the desks as well was unforgivable, they had absolutely no urgency and not a single iota of warmth. AA need to send each and everyone on a customer service training course. No point risking with this airline as if anything happens you’re in for a torrid time."
958, Knoxville to Dallas. Will never be flying with American again. This was my first experience with them. Flight was cancelled due to weather and then due to their mistakes I was not able to board the flight that I rescheduled for. For the third time that I rescheduled they scheduled me for the wrong time. Now I am having to reschedule my flight but no agents are getting back to me. 0/10 terrible service. Unprofessional and incompetent staff. Poor experience.
959,"  Memphis to Denver. The day after Christmas, when all i wanted to do was go back to Denver, when a startling email, caught me asunder. My flight had been canceled due to lack of a reason, I should have known not to fly American this season. I rebooked my flight for the morning of tomorrow only to find I was again stranded, cancelled. There's nothing we can do the lady told me, no customer service to my disbelief. I said give me a refund, they said no way. I said fine, I'm flying southwest. Have a good day."
960,"  Denver to Miami. I am glad I am home and the flight was safe. However the customer service of American Airlines is so bad, nobody really cares about you, as a matter of fact it’s quite the opposite. After canceling our flight at 1 am for reasons not valid since they said it was due to weather but the gate across the hall from us departed to Miami half an hour after and our plane was sitting there the entire time, nobody cared to give us assistance with hotel, and in order to book another flight home which happened to be on my birthday, we had to wait 4 and a half hours on hold, and were able to get on a flight for 2 days later. The worst part is that once we arrive at the ticket counter after all we went through they make a big deal about 4 pounds over weight of my luggage and we purchased the main cabin seats so we can be more comfortable and guess what? Seats don’t recline! We pay $50 for seats that don’t recline! I was exhausted and for a 1:20 am flight you want to sleep, you figure they will tell you seats don’t recline!"
961,"  Chicago to Newark. Our flight was delayed from Cancun to Newark and American Airlines put us on a flight from Chicago to JFK . I was just curious to know if there were any other flights closest to our destination since I saw one available to Newark, but the people at the kiosk were extremely rude and annoying. I sincerely request American Airlines to please incorporate courtesy training with the staff at American Airlines.Its really annoying and insulting for people who wait for 28 hours for the flight and then have to face such annnoying comments. I don’t mind to some extent to wait for the flights due to whatever delays but I at least expect the customer service to be decent enough not to treat people in this way. Especially the staff at Chicago of American Airlines sucks. However we did find one person out of the lot who was courteous enough to put us on a a flight. Thanks to him but for the rest I call out to American Airlines to please deal with in a strict manner."
962,"  I typically don’t write bad reviews but I am extremely disappointed every time I fly with AA. Not only do they completely ruin my holiday plans but they do it without caring. They literally are always putting the blame on something other than their company when really it is the results of poor maintenance and poor flight/booking management. I have been at the airport for going on 12 hours now and I still have a 3.5 hour flight in front of me... and that’s if I’m lucky and they don’t cancel this flight after I wait god who knows how long. Think long and hard before booking a flight with AA, it’s very likely you will have a terrible experience."
963,"  Wichita to Milwaukee. Did not let me pre board with my infant and stroller. No hot water available for a bottle. I called AA twice before my flight from Milwaukee to Wichita and they assured me of pre boarding and that I did not need warmers because hot water was available. My checked luggage was also damaged. After my bad experience I called agents after my flight who were so rude, would not give me their name and then disconnected. She was snarky and insinuated that I was too incompetent to write a formal review on the AA website, which I told her I had already done. I purchased insurance with my first flight and switched flights coming home to be on the same plane as my husband because of the awful experience I had from the beginning. We had to pay for an entirely new ticket instead of just the difference. Cheap, rude and none of our family and friends will ever fly with American Airlines. I would give a 0/10."
964, Dallas to St Louis. What a nightmare trip on American Airlines. We have had problems on every flight this trip. We have had every flight delayed or cancelled and have had to spend an additional two days in hotels and we are still not home. The way they handled the changes we're ridiculous. I have never flown on AA before and recommend that no one else does either.
965,Not Verified |  Hartford to Chicago. Extremely upset with the service of American Airlines. I went up to the woman at the desk and ask nicely if it was possible to make my next flight with only 30 minutes. She then asked me “and who booked this flight” I said myself. She then replied “now there’s the problem that’s your fault you saw the time when you booked it.” I then said “please you don’t need to be rude I’m just trying to understand if I’m actually going to make it so I know if I should stay with the flight.” She then answered the phone and stopped talking to me. I’ve been in customer service for a while and that was the rudest encounter especially with the holidays.
966,"Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Dallas Ft Worth. We visited LA for Christmas. We were scheduled to fly back to Dallas 12/26/18 at 7:45. I was to check in online for that flight and received our boarding passes through email. After we returned our rental car, I then received a text message that our flight back to Dallas has been cancelled. We headed to the airport and out flight was rebooked for later that night 10:30pm LA to Reno then to Dallas. My husband had to miss work. We had to ride the bus going to our assigned gate, as soom as we arrived at the gate I received another text message that Reno to Dallas flight has been cancelled. We approached the staff and they told us to go back to ticketing counter to get our flights rebooked as there is nompoint for us flying to Reno if our final flight to Dallas is cancelled. We stood in line for quite sometime to get our flights rebooked. So our flight got rebooked again to depart evening the following day. We asked if a hotel will be provided, they said no hotel because it is cancelled due to weather. We had to pay extra for our hotel. We also had 1 checked baggage and we were told to go to baggage claim area to get it. When we got there they told us they can’t locate our bag, that it might be being loaded going to Reno. Staff advised us to come back at 5:30am and said since our flight from Reno to Dallas has been cancelled they will send the bag back to LA. All our clothes and toiletries are in out checked baggage. We came back the following day and another staff said it would be a miracle if out bag will be sent back to LA, when she checked the status it said that it is headed to Dallas from Reno. Now we are here at airport, our flight back to Dallas is supposed to depart at 5:59pm 12/27/18. Few minutes after we arrived on the assigned gate, I received a text that our flight is delayed amd will be departing at 7:50pm! The delay Is not about the weather this time. American Airlines is horrible! Won’t be flying with this airline ever again!"
967,"  Tulsa to LaGuardia via Dallas. We will never ever fly this airline again. They left us stranded days before hurricane Irma hit the florida Keys, canceled our flight back from Austin Tx and we had to drive the last leg from Dallas airport, have made us late several times on business and pleasure waiting on a pilot to show up or maintenance. Now, they have ruined our wedding which is planned in NYC because of they cancelled our hours before for maintenance and then they changed their mind and said weather related. They were nice enough to book us a flight 2 days later! though! We have friends leaving the same airport which is Tulsa with different airlines and neither of them were cancelled nor delayed! My fiance wanted to try and stick with American since they headquarter in our local city (Tulsa), She finally said never again! We will cancel our American Airline credit card as well since we will no longer need their frequent flyer miles. Good riddance American Airlines."
968,"Not Verified |  Indianapolis to Cancun via Philadelphia. I flew American airlines out of Indianapolis we were the first flight out of the Airport 5:15 a.m. We boarded our plane and the pilot informed us the Co- pilot was nowhere to be found and they could not reach him. They eventually found a replacement we flew to Philadelphia we landed 10 minutes before our connection flight took off. We ran through the airport only to have the door closed in our face, plane still attached to the jetway. Along with 20 other people who were on the First flight with us. So the group of us marched to customer service to try to catch the next flight which none of us did. We were all rerouted onto multiple other flights. We were rerouted to Dallas ( this flight they also boarded the entire plane they took everyone off because they forgot to do a security check even know the plane had been sitting there for 30 hours and no one though to do that before it was suppose to fly. ) People missed cruises. My wife and I missed an entire day of our honeymoon by the time we got moved around and reached Cancun it was midnight. All because a pilot didn't show up and they couldn't hold a plane for 10 minutes to allow 20 plus people to make the flight. To top it off the airline tried to cover its ass by claiming it was a mechanical malfunction when we talked to customer service deposited the gate agent , captain and flight attendants saying the co pilot didn't show up. Never flying American Airlines again."
969,"Not Verified |  Corpus Christi to Baltimore. Flight canceled just hours before takeoff with only reschedule possible 2 days later to a different airport. Missed reunion, although made reservations 60 days in advance. Much anger. American staff also seemed angry with customers. I don't envy them."
970,"Not Verified |  We arrive at the Tallahassee airport just for them to tell us our flight is delayed due to the crew. That delay was 2 hours. We then received another 2.5 hour delay after our first delay, due to plane problems. We finally board our plane at 12:07 am when we were suppose to board at 8:15 pm. Get to our destination at 2 am and they provide us with a hotel for 1 hour, so we couldn’t sleep or rest. We’re back up at 430 am to catch the bus only to find out our 7:15 am flight was canceled and that they could not get us on another flight till 2 days later. They would not give us a hotel, food, or compensation for loss of wages. I have been up for about 32 hours now and I continue to get mistreated and disrespected by these people. It’s unacceptable and I will never fly American Airlines again and I suggest that no one else does as well. Also, Andrea that works for the front desk in Charlotte, NC LITERALLY yelled at me and then stormed off. The customer service is actually worse than the airline it self."
971,"  San Antonio to Dallas. I have been sitting on a plane for 8 hours and it should have been an hour and a half flight. We sat at our gate for about four hours before we even took off for our flight and now that we have arrived at our destination from San Antonio to Dallas, we have been sitting here for 3 hours. I was originally scheduled to leave at 7.50pm front SAT, and around 5.30 I received a call informing me my flight had been cancelled and that I was going to be on a new flight departing at 6.27. I was 30 minutes from the airport so I rushed, incredibly fast, to find my flight had been cancelled not only once more, but three more times. Now, finally after boarding and waiting four hours to take off due to adding 360 miles to the trip, having to fuel up with 2,000 more pounds of fuel and maintenance problems, here we sit. With no word for almost exactly 3 hours. I had to call DFW to find out why exactly there were no gates available. No food, no water until orange juice was offered at about 2 and a half hours in. I am appalled at this experience. And they ran out of food because the flight before us was supposed to be a 50 minute flight but turned out to be 4 hours."
972,"Not Verified |  San Francisco to Columbia . I arrived Christmas Eve at 11: 45 p.m. to Columbia. My bag did not arrive. I received a text from American Airlines that my bag was on a later flight. I was advised to contact the airline to arrange free delivery, and when I called, I was routed to a voice mail. Now, when I call American airlines to locate my bag, I am told I will have to pay for them to deliver the bag to my address since I did not contact them within the 4 hour window, which would have been Christmas morning midnight until 4 am. I am extremely disappointed in this policy. I am being charged for a mistake made by the airlines."
973,  New York to Charlotte. Horrible disorganized service! Half of staff tried to be nice and helpful other half have given up.
974,"Not Verified |  Detroit to Miami with American Airlines. Extremely unhappy with the customer service and flight operations. I purchased my flight in August to fly in December 2018 only to find a few days before my flight that they have moved the departure/arrival time to later. Additionally, are telling me my only option for me and my girlfriend is that we must purchase two new tickets (with no refund to our originally purchased tickets). This would be adding an extra $400 to my trip cost because they moved the flight time to a new time that conflicts with my schedule. Naturally, I called customer service for them to only continually repeat that they cannot refund or provide me with another flight without buying new tickets. Despite my best attempts to ask other questions, I was interrupted nearly every time I tried to speak. I told the customer representative that I understood their policy (having heard it 3-4 times by now) and wanted to ask other questions. Again, I was interrupted with ""Merry Christmas"" and then he proceeds to hang up the phone."
975," American Airlines from Chicago to Miami. Seriously, probably one of the worst airline companies. Pretty comparable to Spirit. 3 days of cancellations, missed connections and horrible service. Completely unorganized. The staff looks like they seriously dislike their jobs too. What a terrible experience. This airline is sinking quick!"
976,"  Dallas Ft Worth to McAllen. American Airlines has by far the lowest quality planes in the fleet of any airline. The planes are old and in bad shape, the customer service is far below any customer standards. Customer satisfaction is not a priority for AA, not even close."
977,"  LaGuardia to Chicago. I was appalled to find out that unlike every other airline I have ever flown, American makes passengers with infants wait and board at the back of the plane. Clearly they care more about their premium passengers than families and is no longer a family friendly airline. I will never fly American with kids again."
978,Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible experience! Started at 3am when nobody shows to check our bags - almost missed our flight except our 5 am departure gets delayed until 11am! We go eat breakfast only to get alert update that our flight is now taking off at 8am? We rush to make flight only to sit at terminal waiting for all other passengers. Missed our connection to DFW and following connection to Belize City - now waiting at DFW on our lost baggage. I could go on and on about courtesy and such but that was a total flop as well - never again American Airlines!
979,"  Washington to Baton Rouge via Charlotte. Awful. Flight was eventually delayed about four hours, though that information was only fed to us in hour-long chunks. The initial information concerning the delay came an hour before my scheduled departure. The cause of the delay was equipment malfunction, which American admits is entirely within its control. I was re-booked with a flight late the next day that involves an additional hour of layover, and an additional two airs in the air, in a middle seat. All escape row seats were available at the time of my rebooking, but I was explained that these are still only available for a fee. Further other earlier, direct flights, were available and offered to other travelers. No meal vouchers were offered. They offered lodging at the nearby Econolodge and Ramada, the shuttles for which were so small and infrequent that it took me 45-minutes to get from the airport to the hotel. A trip that should have taken three hours will now take 18, directly and solely as a result of American's ineptitude, and the only compensation they see fit to offer is a budget hotel, the commute to which detracts a further two hours from its use."
980,"  Newark to Orlando. We have just had bad experience with American Airlines and had to cancel our vacation, the flight was delayed and we missed connecting flight, and instead of helping and find some solution they told us to cancel our vacation. I was trying to find another person but they did not even talk to us, they were so rude and ignoring, they said they can not put us to another flight because it is overbooked and no compensation, no hotel or free meal, no sorry, will never fly with the company ever again. Stay away from them if you don’t want to ruin your vacation!!!!"
981,"  Miami to Newark. I’ve never experienced such a disgusting flying experience. I was asked to tip the curb side check in by one of the attendants. I was then told my carry-on despite compliance was needed to be checked. After asking for my jacket to be hung up in an empty coat rack, they denied me. They didn’t add my TSA pre - check upon board with a child. I will never fly with American Airlines again."
982,"  Terrible airline. I flew from Boston to Toronto via Laguardia. The plane was delayed for 2 hours in Boston, then they said that I would miss my connection from Laguardia to Toronto. They rerouted my to a flight from JFK to Toronto. When I arrived in Laguardia, they lost my bag and it took me two hours to retrieve it. Airline staff at Laguardia was rude and not helpful. I took a cab to JFK from Laguardia, when I arrived at JFK, I found out AFTER going through security that my flight to Toronto was cancelled. They sent me back to Laguardia, made me standby for two flights, neither of which materialised. There is no apology, no explanation, no compensation. I had to catch a flight from Toronto to Asia, and obviously I missed that and had to take care of the changes, and hotel stay at NYC."
983,Not Verified |  Philadelphia to Tampa. They gave away our seats that we paid for when we had checked in 20 minutes prior to them boarding plane. Airport security held us up! We arrived at airport on time! First time “flying” American Airlines and we will never fly them again!  Let us remind them that - American Airlines’ conditions of carriage specify that passengers must be at their gates and ready to board 15 minutes before a scheduled departure from the US.
984,  Charlotte to Chicago. Complete incompetence. After a 2 hour delay they have us all packed on a plane just sitting here 40 minutes and the pilot says he has no idea how much longer. Anyone that flies with American Airlines should have their head examined.
985,  Miami to Bermuda. American Airlines did a horrific job today. First one of their flight attendants did not show up on time to depart so we didn’t load up until 45 minutes after we were supposed to start. Then after boarding some passenger was not supposed to be on this plane and they had to get his or her bag from under the plane to let them off. They did a terrible job with this as it has taken 2 hours now and we are still sitting here.
986,"  Washington to Syracuse. I said the last time I flew with them, that I wouldn’t again. I should have listened. I was on a flight that not only children, but adults were screaming on. There were thunderstorms the entire flight there, in which I got videos of lightening right outside of our window. Even before the flight, my fiance had clothes that made a bulge in his bag, and they made him throw away a Polo Ralph Lauren T-shirt (60$), a pair of Nike socks, and a pair of Tommy Hilflager boxers ($40), and did not give us the option to check his bag or anything like that, the agent literally pointed at a trash can. That is unacceptable on its own but let me go on. They destroyed my brand new $360 luggage set. And on top of that, My fiancé needed to use the bathroom, and everyone behind us were using it no issue, we paid extra for our seats, but when my fiancé got up to go to the bathroom he went to the one ahead of us ( we were in row 10 I believe, and was denied restroom service) “I’m sorry, can you not read the seat belt sign?” Is the exact words used by the flight attendant, he tried using the bathroom at the front of the aircraft ( irst class bathroom). What I am saying is, American Airlines is at the bottom, but one ahead of United. I fly 4-6 times a month, and they don’t care about their guest at all. "
987,"Not Verified |  Have not flown American Airlines in over 5 years now I know why. So cramped, no leg room, dirty planes, worn and full of germs. I fly a lot for business and pleasure more then 50 trips a year. Recently return from Asia booked budget airlines on outer island that experience was much better then the cramped, hot, dirty American Airlines flight I took. Think again about booking economy class, better off with Southwest, Spirit or Frontier new fleet of planes. American is keeping old planes retro fitting them with more economy seat which means those extra seats take leg room away from somewhere, maybe your seat! Plane was so darn hot asked 3 times to turn on air, sick people around me tons of Babies on flight so could you imagine all the germs the poor kid were exposed to because the lazy flight attendant did not lower temperature! If you want no leg room and a dirty plane book American they no longer have the standard they were known for, they are now a low budget. "
988,"Not Verified |  Charlotte to South Bend. Flight left on time. Although advertised as allowing a carry on bag, there was an effort to get folks to check bags at the gate. Question, if it is allowed, why do they need to be checked - if the plane is small, allow free bag check before getting to the gate. Based upon the way the industry is geared, it seems that the best thing to do is always take the bag with you and allow it to be checked at the gate for no cost. In order to check a bag it required the removal of any medication, batteries, personal items, etc, the items one specifically packs into a carry on bag because they want to have it when they land. Also the cost for the seat (booked last minute) was extremely high (>1000) for a flight of approx. 2 hours. The service on the plane was good. I have decided to not recommend AA due to the gate experience, cost, and poor frequent flyer program."
989,"  Nashville to Ontario via Dallas. Flight was over an hour late leaving Nashville due to mechanical issues. It happens, but, this was my 4th non weather delay on 6 planes just this month. I missed my connection at DFW (after rushing to get to the gate that is always on the other far side) so they put me on a later flight. That was also delayed because the crew was late. I always try to pay extra for seats with leg room due to being a little claustrophobic and did so on both flights. My BNA to DFW seat was 16A an exit row seat. So I thought and so it said on my boarding pass. I get on the plane and it is in fact not an exit row. Okay, I’m irritated at this point, but, still going with it. The lady who helped with the flight (she was nice) from DFW to ONT put me in seat 10-A. No biggie. Window seat right(?) and I understood that I was a late passenger. I get on the plane and although it is next to the fusulage, there is no window AND the there was less leg room than the normal seats. It literally looks like there was an exit door there at some point and they just covered it up and threw a row of seats in.  I’m done with AA period."
990,"  San Antonio to New Bern via Charlotte. American Airlines has always been less than courteous when it comes to customer care. I’m a doctor by profession and have been taking frequent flights recently for my interviews etc. Almost every flight I take with them is delayed and the delay happens to be more than 12 hours every time. I end up missing my connection flight and it affects my job. Their attendants are less than helpful when it comes to updating the customers on flight updates. I have had delays with other airlines like Southwest and delta. Their staff is courteous and they make sure they are updating the passengers every 20 mins or so. The delays that I have faced in American airways are for ridiculous reasons. Like on this recent flight, they had all of us seated on a plane flying out from San Antonio. And right before take off they announced that they just realized that they don’t have a pilot available to fly the plane. Another time, they kept delaying the flight every 20 mins for a total time of 8 hours because ‘a seat on the plane was broken’ I realize unexpected things happen all the time but with this frequency and the attitude of the employees of this big company, is very disappointing."
991,  Boston to Washington DC. My flight this morning was late to take off from Boston due to unexpected snow. Because of this I was worried I wasn’t going to make my connecting flight to Sarasota so I had asked a traveling flight attendant a quick question about it and I was beyond amazed by the response. Cynthia for AA went above & beyond helping me out! She walked me thru Washington terminal & even gave up her seat because it was closer so I could make my flight (I didn’t) but it was her kindness and thoughtfulness that made the whole process not as stressful. Thank you Cynthia & Lisa. Because of your kind act I will always look to fly American Airlines first going forward.
992,"  Miami to St Maarten. Worst ever treatment by an airline company.  You can't carry a carry-on for your 75 years old father unless paying additional fee, you can't carry a hat on your head, you can't have 1/2 pound over 50lb until repack, but carry it on your body is OK. Total weight will be the same, and more stuff inside cabin."
993,"  Amarillo to Dallas Fort Worth via Corpus Christi. The worst experience I’ve had with any flight. Delay after delay. Then when we finally get to Corpus we can’t even get to our gate to get off the plane! Unorganized, and uneducated on their job. Lied about tires in Amarillo.  Never again."
994,"  I came to the Albuquerque airport to pick up my daughter and had my TSA credentials with me so that I could go through TSA security. Thanks American for the terrible customer service and not  allowing me to use that to get through security to get my daughter. I would have preferred to use the expedited security line because I am allowed but agent didn’t want to fuss and gave no explanation. United is the worst airline, and American Airlines have become a close second. "
995,"  
Phoenix to Newark. They've taken to splitting everyone up just to charge 80 dollars a seat to get back together. Their customer service sucks, their planes are uncomfortable and are, generally, an awful way to fly."
996,"Not Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Baltimore with my 6 month old baby and my mother in law for an event. Had a good flight. Plane left in time and we got there on time. Sadly enough our bags did not arrive. My baby’s food (which at the airport they won’t let me carry in my hand luggage), diapers, bath, clothes etc I was mad frustrated because the  attendants were not help matters. They asked me to buy and mail receipts for refund. My bag only came next day at noon. When I mail the receipts it took forever. I started calling to find out it was from one excuse to another. Some customer service said the file has been closed. Thank God for one staff who took my case personal and helped out. She is the best specialist for central baggage."
997,"  Nashville to New York. I’m highly disappointed by the ground service of American Airlines. I had to check in and drop luggage at the front. I waited in line for 15 min then agent asked to go to the kiosk and print boarding passes and bag tags. (Isn’t that suppose to be their only job in first place to get us checked in?). Anyways I went to kiosk (another line), waited there for another 15-20 min. Finally I started to check in and it didn’t allow me. I asked for help and guess what I had to go to the another counter, and another queue. Those two old ladies were the slowest people on earth, didn’t had any clue how to handle computer, they had to ask for help for every customer and took them at least 5 mins to address each customer. I had to wait for another 15-20 min. I was very anxious by now as I had a flight in less than 45 min and had to go through security and all. Finally I managed to get my bags checked in, she didn’t make it any easy, I had to take off few items as I my bags were overweight by 1 freaking pound. She started to give me lecture on how it can make flight imbalance and all. I was gonna ask what do you do about 400 pounds people? Do you ask them to distribute their weight across flight? Anyway god bless bna security people, I cleared security check in less than 15 min and was able to make to the flight in time."
998,"  Madrid to Miami seat 13A. Premium Economy Seats on the Boeing 777 are located in a very small area about 21/24 seats next to the business class. Seats are great, service is excellent except for the lavatories. PE passengers are not allowed to use the business class bathroom in any circumstances. The flight attendants treat the 21/24 premium passengers like they were not human beings that have spent much more money to have the comfort they need and make them to walk about 60 rows in a very narrow aisle completely packed of people and stay in a endless line to use a very dirt and super small lavatory which is really a challenge and return to their seats at PE that means walk back 60 rows in a very narrow aisle with a lot of people standing. I have been traveling in a PE at Virgin Atlantic and also in Air France where PE passengers are treated as a priority class. Next time no more American Airlines, there is better service out there!"
999,"  Norfolk to Dallas Ft Worth. Overall experience as far as customer service at the counter, flight attendants, comfort, and flight was good. But when something goes wrong they go to their little policies and leave you hanging dry. My flight got canceled due to weather no obviously that’s out of their control which I completely understand, but then they book me to another flight in less then 24 hours to the same city where it currently is snowing at the time and where the weather channel is reporting heavy snow for the next few days. When they basically say that this is the only next available flight we obviously take it, but it also gets canceled. I’ve traveled with Allegiant and have had flights canceled due to weather, but they provided a hotel and even vouchers for our next flight. So we got stuck for two days paid hotel, food, and also missed work for two days. I guess every airline has a different policy, just some are better than others."
1000,"  Springfield to Albuquerque via Dallas Ft Worth. Flew American today and I am so happy that I regularly fly Southwest!! My flight was delayed because of a ground hold, arrived late into Dallas, was told to ‘run’ to the gate to get my connection and they closed the door as I walked up. I’m then put on another flight, in a coach seat, even though I paid for extra legroom and get to board last. Thanks for your attention to detail American and for taking great care of your customers. Like they even care?"
1001,"  Ft Lauderdale to Philadelphia. The plane turned around very quickly to accommodate connections in PHL. I appreciate the captains concern. To make this turnaround happen, no food was put on the plane and minimum clean up was done. I paid full fare first class. Nothing but 2,000 points offered. I should have been refunded my fare down to a full coach fare. I will do my best to not fly American and to let the world know how unimportant the customer is to AA."
1002,Not Verified |  Salt Lake City to Morelia. Very disappointed in our recent flight with my family. The flight never told us we might not get our luggage due to the passenger weight. When we arrived at our destination after a very long 23hours of traveling we go get our luggage and they tell us and about 10 more passengers from the same flight that our luggage had been left at a previous airport! Very frustrating we have been on our trip for 4 days now and our luggage is still not here. I have been calling our landing airport to see if they have them yet and they tell me we need to call our airline. We have had to spend more money now buying clothes since we don't have our luggage. I can’t get through to them and it seems as they don’t care about making their flight passengers happy. This is definitely the last time we fly this Airline. Let’s see how long it takes to get our luggage.
1003,  Ft Wayne to Charlotte. What helpful and pleasant customer service associates. I purchased a non refundable ticket 10 days before the hurricane hit North Carolina in September. American Airlines was kind enough to offer me a travel voucher. I booked for November and then my grandfather died and yet again American Airlines gave me a travel voucher. Above and beyond I love the direct flight from FWA to CLT! And now on will purchase travel insurance
1004,"Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Salt Lake City. My wife and I were to catch AA flt 6036 to LAX leaving at 11:59. Before 8:00 AM we got an E-Mail from AA saying the flight was on time. At 9:00 AM the baggage agent told us the flight was 20 minutes delayed. The inbound aircraft never left the ground! We were told at about 12:00 that the flight had been canceled but there was plenty of room on flt 3401 leaving at 2:30 PM (too late to catch the ship). The gate attendant knew that the flight had been canceled but waited until all competitive flights had left before the announcement. This was a clear case of canceling a lightly booked flight and consolidating it with a later flight to save money. A classic case of AA's ""customer be damned"" business philosophy. Never again with AA"
1005,"Not Verified |  I paid for and flew first class from Cedar Rapids to Las Vegas on American Airlines on November 23 2018. On the DFW leg of the flight I had reserved a meal for this flight. Everyone in first class was served drinks and a meal before me. I thought it was rather strange, but I didn't say anything. After everyone had eaten the attendant told me that they did not have my meal. The meal that I had pre ordered! I was then given a snack box. They told me that there was no record of me ordering the meal. Even if I had not ordered a meal I think I should have been served with the other passengers. I received 5,000 frequent Flyer miles for my trouble, wow!"
1006,"  Atlanta to Miami. The distance was not long but I will never fly with them again they have bad delays. I took this flight from Atlanta to Miami to get on my cruise ship the plane had a delay which made me miss the boat after calling for several hours to customer service I couldn’t get no help. Customer service continued to hang up, be rude, was non caring they made me feel less as a customer saying it’s nothing they can do while there policy states “if we have delays we will accommodate you on the next flight” - they did not, all they said was sorry buy a new ticket which is inconsiderate while they mad me miss my next connection. "
1007, Phoenix to San Antonio. Changed boarding gate # with no announcement. Almost missed flight. Staff was rude when asked about it. Will never fly American again. There was no concern that I almost missed my flight and that others may have missed it all together. Horrible customer service.
1008,"Not Verified | Round trip from Fayetteville, NC to Chicago, IL. Departed 2/04 returned 12/05. Return flight from Chicago departed 2 hours late. Missed connection from Charlotte to Fayetteville. Had to stay in Charlotte over night. Flight home to Fayetteville next morning left 40 minutes late. American had 5 chances to get a plane out of the gate on time and failed four of the five times. All Delta due to equipment failure of maintenance issues. Never again!"
1009," Austin to Chicago. Have flown many other airlines in the last several years and I really can’t say I thought one outdid American. They have really improved a lot over the last several years. Better seats, better planes, better lounges, more routes and generally respond well to feedback. The basic economy and the choice to make status much more difficult are unfortunate and weak in their copy cat nature but we shall see how they play out."
1010,"  San Jose to Nashville via DFW. The customer service of this airline has consistently been pretty terrible and rude. I was placed on standby for a flight and went to the gate desk a little early and told to come back after the current flight departed. Understandable, no problem (with the exception of the slight attitude the gate attendant had with my mere presence). I came back when my flight was supposed to be serviced, and again told the flight just needed to pull out of the gate and she could help me, again with annoyance that I was back. I stand back a couple feet to make it clear that I am ready when she is, and then proceed to listen to the gate attendant talk about vacation, travel, all other chitchat etc., for 30 minutes - ignoring that I’m clearly waiting for her. I approach and tell her I’d like my seat assignment, and she breaks from her social hour, and throws a boarding pass at me that was already printed! Why was she waiting to just hand it off? This employee had no interest in doing a key component of her job, in just being generally pleasant like a normal human being, and instead wanted to just loaf and chat with colleagues as her main job - all else an annoyance. Most American flights I’ve had were delayed, and I only reluctantly booked again because I have a lot of travel this month and wanted to stretch a budget. If you can, pay a bit extra for any other airline to get you to your destination and be treated with some semblance of respect along the way."
1011,"Not Verified |  
We have flown American Airlines in Business a number of times over the past years and found it lacking in comparison with other carriers. This trip, however, broke that pattern. The 789 from Paris to Dallas was a delight, comfortable and plenty of cubbies for storage. The service was very good and the food was excellent. Based on expectations, this flight got an A+ in every category. The DFW-SJC portion was good but limited by the service standards of domestic flying. Crew was nice but I fail to understand why US carriers do not put footrests in F cabins. It is a small thing but adds greatly to the comfort of the flight. Good job AA."
1012,"Not Verified |  Montego Bay to Boston via Miami / New York. Worst airline I’ve ever flown with. First could not get seats together with my husband. Was told & desk they don’t sit family members together because they want you to pay to sit together. That we buy the “air” not the seats. If we want to sit together more $$, even though empty seats together still available. Second booked our flight directly from Boston to Montego Bay Jamaica and back. Return flight from Montego Bay to Miami to LaGuardia NY to Boston. Left Sandals at 4 Am. Cannot for the life of me figure out Why they sent us this route when there were direct flights with empty seats from Miami to zBoston. For us to change was $400 additional. In LaGuardia now flight delayed 2 hours. We’ve been traveling since 8am will not arrive in Boston till 9:15 but every time we look at monitor delayed more. Horrible experience. Will never fly this airline again. Staff not sympathetic"
1013,"  In booking my round trip flight from XNA (Fayetteville, AR)to RSW (Ft. Myers) and back, when I printed the itinerary, the return flight was not to XNA but to FSM. Reservations wanted $400 to correct the return flight to the airport we originated from. It makes no sense that when booking online, I click on Round Trip and then enter from XNA to RSW and somehow the return flight gets mixed up and has us flying into a totally different airport. And they want me to pay $400 to make the correction to the airport that I was suppose to be returning to in the first place. That's what I call idiotic! I'll be looking for a different airline for our next trip."
1014,"  London to Guadalajara via Dallas. I'm unsure if American used to have high customer service standards, but they certainly do not have them now. They are the worst airline I have travelled with, especially as a Business customer. The planes are outdated, I was given drinks tokens in the lounge, my screen broke from London to Dallas and it needed 3 follow ups from me to get a tablet instead. My flight from Dallas to Washington was deplaned due to an issue, I then wasn't allowed back into the Lounge I had already been in. There were many people on the plane who had already come from a cancelled plane. I get the impression that this is routine for American. In a week period I flew on 4 American flights, and each of them had an issue of some description. Their Business and First Lounges are dated, lack facilities and food (especially compare to Emirates which are brilliant). Giving it 3 stars because I made it to the destinations eventually, and I had a particularly good steward from Dallas-Guadalajara. However none of the trips were relaxing, despite paying for First or Business."
1015,"Not Verified | Houston to Los Angeles. Just the most horrible flight I have ever had. What more can I say. The seats are so small and hard, the service was terrible (what little there was of it), the toilets were putrid and not cleaned through the flight (even after the staff were made aware), and when I asked for water through the flight as I got very dehydrated and unwell, I got the royal eye roll. I had paid for the seat upgrade to the bulk head and the staff came barrelling through with the trolleys with not as much as a warning let alone an excuse me. The only positive thing was the current movies they had to view and the ground staff were helpful especially in relation to tracking my lost bags. I will never fly this airline again."
1016,  New York to London. It was a night flight. I hate the night flights because I am not able to sleep on the plane. There were two meals. A hot and a cold. My place was in the 24th row. The flight is 7 hours long it is acceptable.
1017,  London to Miami. My seat was in the 42nd row. For the 10 hours the seat and legroom is very uncomfortable. They offered a hot a cold food and an ice cream. They had given beverages very often. The food was average. The stewardess was very very helpful and kind.
1018,"  Miami to Washington. The interior of the plane was brand new. The windows are very low, any other thing is perfect. Clean carpet, seat, restroom. Helpful and kind staff. Cheap price. Fast boarding. They offered free, water and biscuit. Legroom and seat is enough for this 3 hours flight."
1019,"Not Verified |  Portland  to Pensacola via Washington. Worst treatment ever. I expressed to the gate attendant that I will miss my connection since the first flight was late. Totally dismissed me. We arrived late then parked on the runway waiting on a gate. Spent forever in line for customer service. Then they tried not to put me up in a hotel for the night. They rescheduled me for the following morning. No dinner, no breakfast. Next day the desk attendant was rude to me when I asked to get a seat closer to the do so as not to have to walk for long. Treated me as a leper because I was flying economy! Very hurtful and condescending. Last time I fly with AA. I’ll spend some more I fly with a decent airline"
1020, Valparaiso to Lansing via Washington. Absolutely horrid excuse for customer service or an airline in general. Every flight delayed due to incompetence and not a single employee that can answer any question. I will never waste money on such a trash airline again. How pathetic that Spirit is now better than American. Save your time save your money fly anything but American 0/10
1021,"  Seattle to Cancun via Charlotte. American Airlines has the worst customer service. We were flying on vacation from Seattle to Cancun - 1 stop in Charolette, North Carolina. I chose this flight because it was a red eye flight beginning at 10:30 PM to allow us almost a full extra day of vacation in Cancun. The A321 airplane they used on our first flight was horrible. No in-flight entertainment system, no charging area in your seats and the seat space was cramped.  On our second flight on our way to Cancun we were on the tarmac when the pilot notified us of an issue with the plane where we would have to return to the gate for a 20 mins fix. Once at the gate, we were told the paperwork would delay us longer and they would find another aircraft. After another 2 hour wait the flight was just cancelled. No notification at all. 280 people began scrambling to find another flight. Needless to say they sent us to customer service where they had major computer issues and just rebooked us all on another flight the next day.  This was after 2 hours of standing in line. They put us up in a hotel by the airport, with no bags, and a $12.00 per person food voucher only for use at the airport with no restaurants but a small Starbucks for food. They made a meager attempt to give us 15,000 miles for our inconvenience but that doesn't cover our lost day of vacation, hotel fees for a day in Cancun, and additional food and Uber expenses in Charlotte. In attempts to get additional reimbursement for our hotel fees etc, they declined and said we should have gotten travel insurance. RI am not going to accept their 15,000 miles because I never plan to fly this airline ever again. "
1022,"  Washington DCA to Chicago. I just want to express my gratitude to 2 American Airlines customer service employees at Reagan National airport in DC. I am dealing with a vision disability and the both went the extra mile to help me change my flight and get me the proper info and they did it with a great attitude. Thank you, your patience and kindness went above and beyond!"
1023,"  LaGuardia to Washington via Buffalo. Poor and horrible service, too many delays in one trip.It should be a one hour fly until Washington and one more hour to get to Buffalo. I took my flight at 4pm and finally got home at 2am, small seats, no food not even water. Horrible and very uncomfortable."
1024,"  I had a terrible experience flying from Chicago O'hare to San Antonio. My flight was delayed 5 times due to snow but workers were not able to help you and they were disrespectful. I totally do not recommend you flying in this airline. Service is awful, we were waiting in the plane for 2 hours to depart and we just get a glass of water or soda in the whole flight. "
1025,"  Corpus Christi to San Jose. I travel quite frequently whether it be business or leisure and usually am very happy with my flight. This instance however is unacceptable. I am a US Soldier and had to fly out of Corpus to arrive at my final destination San Jose to having no bags. My flight did not change. I had all my uniforms to go to my next training site, and now have been held up due to the airline losing my bags, and telling me I am unable to receive them till after 11am today. This is totally unacceptable. I would understand if flights had been delayed or changed, but neither of this happened. I am a frequent flyer and used 75,000 points to get this flight, and now I will be attending a training late due to your irresponsible staff."
1026,"  Chicago to Boston. American Airlines is the most inefficient and disrespectful airline out there. They are late, and today they got to my limit by canceling my first flight at 3pm for no reason, they also expected me to get on a different flight to Boston vía Florida. After I discussed for 20 minutes with a very disrespectful customer service assistant she proceeded to give me a ticket to a flight straight to Boston 3 hours later (keep in mind she said several times it wasn’t possible to fly straight to Boston today, disregarding the fact that I paid 700$ in order to fly direct). The 6pm flight got cancelled after many hours of delay and now they won’t give me my carry on bag which they made me check back, and the cherry on top is that they expect me to leave tomorrow to Philadelphia and on Tuesday to Boston. Of course I am expected to pay for the hotel because that is the American Airlines way! Do yourself a favor and stay away from this so called airline."
1027,"  Charlotte to Philadelphia. The crew were late to get on board, we left over a hour late from CLT. Then once we arrived into Philadelphia there were no ground crew waiting. Sitting on the ground as we wait “for the ground manager to assemble a crew”, so the pilot said, “American doesn’t usually hold these standards"". I took this same flight last Friday  CLT - PHL and no ground crew where ready too. It’s a huge same American. You need to get yourself sorted. Bad hospitality half the time, late the rest."
1028,"Not Verified |  Washington to Miami via Washington. The flight to Miami was pretty good. Staff were courteous and attentive. The flight back was extremely disappointing. The seats were smaller and on an older model plane, and the staff barely attended to us. The nuts were lukewarm, and our trays were not emptied until the flight was almost over. The staff was more interested in talking to each other and playing on their phones than assisting anyone on the flight. Needless to say, we will not be flying American Airlines ever again. The service and level of comfort is vastly different than what we experienced on United Airlines and we will not be choosing American Airlines for future travel."
1029,"  Raleigh Durham to New York. My first flight didn't offer us so much as a pretzel for a snack, despite a travel time of over three hours. The onboard wifi didn't work, meaning we had no entertainment whatsoever for 3+ hours. Poor service all around. On my second (return) flight, the wifi was working but I was charged $12 for access to it, after which the ""free"" movies would not load due an an error with the American Airlines app. I watched YouTube instead. Avoid this airline at all costs!"
1030,"  Los Angeles to Honolulu. Good Flight, but nothing special. Flight was on time from push back to landing. Bags also arrived very quickly which is a nice surprise from AA the mainland operations could learn something from the Islands on how to get a plane unloaded and bags arriving quickly. Plane is showing it's age with well wore seats. IFE worked great. I did not try the WiFi so I don't know if it worked over water. My disappointment with the flight is it was only OK, nothing special like the Hawaii flights use to be. FA did the bare minimum to make it through the flight again, nothing special. Meal was again, ok, nothing great. If you want a special experience for your trip to the islands, I would recommend Hawaiian Airlines and stay off the big three."
1031,  Phoenix to Austin. My review is for my son who who bumped out of his seat on his flight home from Phoenix to Austin. He had early checked in online 24 hours earlier and already had his boarding pass on his IPhone when he arrive at the gate. He arrived at the gate 15 minutes before the plane was due to depart. The person at the boarding pass scanner told my son your seat was just given away to a standby passenger. The gate agent gave my sons seat away right at the time my son arrived telling my son he was late but he was not late. So the gate agent was looking to bump someone off the flight in order to accommodate a middle aged couple maybe because they had made some sort of excuse. It was not right for the American Airlines gate agent to give my son seat away as he already had his boarding pass and they could have let him board but would not. They claimed he was late to the gate but he was right there while the gate agent was giving away his seat to another standby passenger.
1032,"Not Verified |  Chicago to London. Food and service was good. Seats are comfy. Good flight overall. Airline needs to take better care of their passengers belongings, both mine and my fiances luggage were completely ruined. We now have to buy new luggage. My suitcase had only been used once previously. Very disappointed."
1033,"  Miami to London Heathrow. Check in and bag drop were easy as a Premium Economy customer can use Priority where the lines are very short. This is conveniently located next to the Priority TSA security lane that I was able to use so I was airside in MIA about 15 mins after dropping my bag. Once airside, because I'm a Oneworld Sapphire cardholder, I was eligible to use a lounge. Whilst AA has more than one lounge in MIA I headed for the best one which is the Flagship Lounge. Lots of space and different seating areas and points for food and beverage to avoid bottlenecks. The hot food was superb and indulged in a little bit of this together with some champagne and really good Californian red wine. About a 5 min walk to board and most others had already boarded so there was no line at the gate, even though I had priority boarding if needed. The Premium Economy cabin is small, only 3 or 4 rows, with a bathroom right in front of the first row. I had no problem placing my hand baggage in the locker. The seats are very new and comfortable. I flew out Main Cabin Extra (MCE) just a few days earlier so could easily compare the seating. The IFE screen is noticeably bigger than coach as is the width of the seat. The legroom is very comfortable, with a foot rest, but to be honest only a couple of inches more than MCE, but several more than Main Cabin. The Premium Economy recline is really good, so you can create a fairly relaxed seating position overall. Proper ear surrounding headsets give a better sound offering for the movies, which are the same as offered in coach. We were offered drinks and pretzels within 30 mins of departure and the offering was the same as coach. Not much time passed before the main meal came out with more drinks. The food presentation was good, solid crockery and metal cutlery. But after this point, is where it fell flat. The main course appears to be bespoke for Premium Economy, presumably as an enhanced offering. A number of my fellow passengers had pre-ordered special dietary meal. There is also an option to pre-order your main meal even if not for dietary reasons. I had not done this. As a result I was offered no choice and given this bland, tasteless, protein free vegetable risotto. It is the most disappointing long haul inflight main course meal I have had in all my travels. Even more so because I was in Premium Economy. Thank goodness I'd earlier eaten in their Flagship Lounge.  About an hour before arrival a light breakfast was served consisting of a fresh fruit plate, banana yoghurt and a small cinnamon pastry with tea or coffee and juices. This was fine, although a hot beverage refill would have been welcome. Despite the disappointing dinner, with the good seat comfort I got about 5 hours sleep. Bag delivered promptly at Heathrow with no issues. My verdict on AA Premium Economy: slick on the ground, very comfortable in the air, but didn't see the premium in the food and beverage offering. I'd fly it again depending on the extra cost over Main Cabin."
1034,"  London to Miami. I was able to pre-reserve a seat in a Main Cabin Extra row as I'm a Oneworld Sapphire cardholder so this was a great start. Check-in bag drop was a breeze as I was able to use the Priority Check in area even though in Economy. Quickly through Heathrow T3 Fast Track. Then a choice of lounge in T3 for Oneworld (BA, AA, Cathay and the new Qantas lounge). I was entitled to use the AA Admirals Club, but opted instead to use the Cathay Pacific lounge which was great. Once on board I got settled in quickly and was really impressed with the extra legroom I got in Main Cabin Extra and some of the lockers are designated as reserved for these customers. The inflight food and beverage offering is the same as everyone else in Main Cabin. But I can't really grumble. I got a drink and a sweet biscuit within an hour of departure. For Lunch, which followed shortly afterwards, portions were sufficient and the main course very tasty. The FA's were generous with the wine and we're happy to give refills on request. About an hour out from landing a hot small pizza calzone was served with a choice of drinks. The entertainment offering was average with a reasonable selection of modern release movies and the screen and sound were fine. With the exception of leg room, which exceeded my expectations, this flight lived up to what I would expect for a long haul international economy flight. I'd fly AA international again."
1035,  Departed El Paso Friday morning for Paris with a two hour layover in Dallas Tx. Monday night my luggage is still sitting in Dallas. Putting a piece of luggage on an airplane is beyond their brain capacity.  Does anyone at American Airlines actually care? Are you listening to customers or just collecting flight benefits as you ramsack luggage building your wardrobe? Carry on luggage only.
1036,  Hartford to Chicago. I accidentally booked a flight for 7.30pm not 7.30am. I paid 200.00 to change the flight and an additional 300.00 because the rate changed. I arrived to the airport to leave at 7.30am and the plane broke down. The repair took all day and we ended up leaving at 730pm after all and they will not refund the additional amount paid to take the early flight that I was not able to get on. They nickle and dime you for everything but do not take care of the customer when they are at fault. I have flown 13 times since May and this is how they treat me.
1037,"  Las Vegas to Philadelphia. When I purchased my tickets, I forgot to secure my seats. By the time I remembered, my seat on my outbound flight was an isle and on the return flight a middle. Although I am slightly claustrophobic, I felt I could manage the return if I kept my mind busy. Well, I was wrong. I will remember my return flight today forever. While waiting for my boarding group number to load, the airline informed us they were looking for 10 people to give up their seats as they were overbooked. They offered a $1,000 voucher. Wanting to get home sooner, I boarded the flight and sat down in my middle seat after the isle passenger moved aside. Once I sat down and with the other passenger next to me, my claustrophobia kicked in and my heart started to accelerate. I felt a cold sweat and a feeling of being trapped. I tried hard to read a book but knew after 1 minute that it wasn't working. I asked the passenger to get up and quickly exited the seat. I rushed up to the stewardess and told her I had a problem. I explained I was having a panic attack due to the middle seat position and my claustrophobia. She immediately looked me in the eye and told me everything would be fine. She told me her father also had the same fear. She helped me out of the plane past the line of entering passengers and told me to take deep breaths. She then went back inside the plane and asked the passenger in the isle seat if they minded moving to the middle. Unfortunately they said no, so she took my carry on bag and escorted me back to the check-in area to be placed in an isle seat on another plane. Now the story does not end there. Because the plane was overbooked, a passenger seated on the isle in the emergency row decided to deplane. Rather than placing another passenger in that seat they brought me back in the plane. The flight was wonderful and I had no further anxiety problems. I even got home on time to see my family. I feel American Airlines and the stewardess went above and beyond. I will remember the kindness they showed me today for the rest of my life."
1038,"  New York to Freeport via Miami. Absolute poor experience from end to end. When we checked in, the boarding passes didn’t work when we entered security. Our re-check-in was done with an attitude of me not understanding how things work - which isn’t very customer service minded. After we arrived at our destination, 2 of 3 checked in luggage’s missed our flight (we had 2.5h layover) and was not found until the day after. Neither of these experiences were managed well, and no one (!!) from the additional assistance during check-in (and re-check-in) to the baggage service representative (via phone) had any empathy or a customer service mentality. Please note, we were traveling with an infant. On the way back to our home, we experienced an unpleasant situation while boarding the first airplane. We were kindly asked to check in a carry on at the counter, and we explained that our carry on had baby equipment required for a long layover (blankets, harness etc.). A classical superviser-type (by attitude) employee from AA interrupted the conversation, without any respect of existing explanation (or emphathy for that matter), and ordered us to check in our carry on. If we did not, she told us we wouldn’t be allowed to board the airplane. “Next flight you’re taking is at 6PM” was her exact words. This was said without even trying to solve our issue! It contributed to the unpleasant situation we experienced at the gate. Worth mentioning we were flying with carry on allowed as part of our ticket. We unwillingly gave up our carry on (incl. important baby stuff) only to discover that half of the overhead bins were empty when boarding was complete. I am frequently using AA for business trips - it’s though no longer my first choice when other options are available. Participated in the post flight questionnaires provided by AA. I honestly gave up after answering questions for 10 minutes - also realized I was only through 1/3 of the steps."
1039,"  Orange County to Gainesville via Miami. The airline had no control over the weather delays, but my flight landed late which made me late to my connecting flight home. I had to stay overnight in Miami; I was frustrated, irritated and just wanted to get on my flight. I talked to the gate agent and they gave me a voucher for a hotel ($200 a night kind of hotel). The room I received was a King sized bed with a golf course view of water and palm trees. The company also gave me a $12 voucher in order for me to eat that following day. I was mad about not going home but this company exceeded my expectations! I had a similar situation happen with Delta Airlines and it was a joke. They gave me a $50 voucher as compensation, that was it!"
1040,Not Verified | Topeka to Meridian via Chicago. This flight was outstanding. Seating was comfortable and service outstanding! I highly recommend American Airlines! Will not hesitate to fly with American again.
1041," Oklahoma City to Dallas. American Airlines is a disaster! Let’s review: 1) Plane delayed 30 minutes from OKC to Dallas. 2) Plane delayed 20 minutes after landing in Dallas. 3) Arrive 2 minutes late to catch our 2nd AA flight with 10 other people from our first AA flight! 4) AA didn’t wait for us 10 to catch 2nd flight and even left the gate ~7 minutes before scheduled. We know because we watched the plane back out. 5) Lost $600 in travel costs and 30 hours of my life. 6) This airline is by far the worst, from an organizational standpoint. It’s apparent from every aspect of the way their organization is run."
1042,Not Verified | Pittsburgh to Charlotte. Delayed on the runway for over an hour and they wouldn’t provide me with a drink of water while on the ground with no actual reason. I had a very dry sore throat and this made it very uncomfortable. They didn’t even seem to show any sort of empathy for me or my request. Never had good experiences with this airline and this will only add to my list.
1043,"Not Verified | I had a horrible experience flying back from Boston to Miami with American Airlines. The flight that was supposed to leave at 6pm got first delayed to 7.15pm: I literally saw the plane that was supposed to be the one that would have taken us to Miami, be given to the people in the 4.50pm flight from Boston to Miami. After that, we were told we were waiting for a flight from Philadelphia to get to Boston and they would have boarded us there. Well, the plane got to Boston at 7.45pm but we couldn’t board for “weather-related problems” when the reality was that the crew wasn’t there. Well some crew members got to the airport and boarded the 4.50pm flight that was waiting in the parking since 6pm. We were told that another crew was on their way and our flight would have taken off at 10pm. At 10.30pm we were told we wouldn’t be able to go to Miami and our flight was cancelled. No refund, no hotel provided because it was “weather related” when really it was because American Airlines couldn’t get the crew to the airport. At that point it wasn’t even raining in Boston. If this wasn’t enough, the personnel at the desk was incredibly rude. They lied to us multiple times regarding the status of the flight, they told us the problem was the weather when all the other flights were taking off from Boston, just not to provide us with reimbursement. When I asked them to be put on a flight for Miami ASAP since my pet was at home alone they told me “well, pray this flight is leaving because we don’t have any tool for tomorrow”. And when I told them I would have complained they yelled at me. I will never fly American Airlines again."
1044,"  My flight was from Jackson to Phoenix, with a connecting flight in Dallas. Our flight to Dallas was 5932. There was a weather delay and we were told we would miss our connecting flight in Dallas and that we would “have to figure it out.” When we arrived in Dallas we were notified that our connecting flight was also delayed, so we were overjoyed that we would make the flight. After running to the terminal, we learned that there was an electronic issue aboard flight 556 to Phoenix that they working to resolve. This announcement was repeated over the next two hours. The next announcement said that the plane was out of order and they were looking for another flight. Then another announcement saying that was incorrect and that they were still working to fix the original electronic issue. After another hour goes by we were all given hotel vouchers and were booked on the same flight for the next morning at 9:00. We arrived at the terminal on time for the flight. After a thirty min delay, an announcement arrived that the pilots had not arrived. Then another 30 min: “there is an electronic issue.” After another two hours they said that the plane was out of service. We were told that all remaining flights to Phoenix were full and we were routed to customer service. I was told that there were 4 seats left on a flight to Phoenix about 5 terminals down and were given new boarding passes. After me and my wife get there as fast as we could, we were told that the flight was already gone. At this point my wife collapses sobbing. You see, she only gets two days this year for personal reasons and one has already been wasted in an airport. Not to mention what our plans for this trip were, which I will get to in a min. Anyway we go back to customer service and they get us on a flight to El Paso to Phoenix flight 2399. When we boarded the plane in El Paso, we sat on the tarmac for 45 min with no air conditioning. Babies were crying, the flight attendant even made the comment that passengers should not be treated this way. Some staff during this process were rude, some were very gracious and helpful, like Sally from customer service at the Dallas airport. Now let’s talk about expenses. I have invested in a continuing eduction course in Scottsdale for Nov 8 and 9 for a total of $3,000. I missed one of those training days. I took off of work for the remainder of the week. I realize you don’t care about these things, but these inconveniences resulted from your poor systems and protocols and lack of communication."
1045,"  Los Angeles to Kona. American Airlines is the worst! I arrived to check in my bag 40 minutes before my flight. They have a strict policy that you have to check a bag within 45 minutes of your flight. If you don't they force you to buy another buy and get on anther flight! They provided zero alternative options for getting my bag there on time. They didn't let me get on my flight and take the chance my bag would be delivered on another flight. Plus, they have retarded bag fees and their customer service phone line had a 45 minute wait! "
1046,"  Las Vegas to Atlanta. The worst experience ever that I received. For someone whose scared to fly I believe they need to be better at their service. If something going wrong with the flight I believe that there should be communication being given to passengers. If a passenger explained that their flight leaves at a certain time, like 20 min from now what you don't do is tell the person whose seated way in the back to hurry up and make it to they flight in order to make it. When their difficulty happening on the plane. There was no type of order. To be paying for a flight I do wish to get treated right and not being disrespected to and treated as if I'm nothing."
1047,"Not Verified |  Newark to Phoenix. I fly almost every week for work and never had a positive experience with American Airlines. I paid for preferred seating for a window seat and there’s no window in my aisle, and they also made me check my carry on bag, which they do every single time regardless of size. I have also had more delays with American Airlines than any other airline. I am an American Airlines member and cardholder and still am treated poorly. On top of all of that, it is completely impossible to get in touch with customer service. Would not recommend."
1048,  Lihue to Phoenix. I booked and paid for a first class seat. When I get to the airport they downgraded me without my approval to a coach seat. I was told it was because they overbooked first class. When I paid for first class there was only two seats booked at the time. I was informed my downgrade was because the other travels had a higher status with American then I do. Seriously? This is how American treats people. Never again
1049,"  Pensacola to Boston via Charlotte. I recently flew American and the flight resulted in a change to a further airport, a delay in the new flight due to airport maintenance that was known about but not conveyed until after the flight was supposed to take off and finally an hour wait while they retrieved our gate checked bags and found us a hotel. Each individual I spoke to was very polite but ultimately the company policy made this a difficult,exhausting, and ultimately very costly trip with lost days of work."
1050,"  Denver to Charlotte. Waited at gate for paperwork (as per captain) Made us almost miss connection. After standing at the luggage carousel for 30 min, we realized our luggage was not there. Walked all over the airport trying to find a AA employee. Found a security girl that directed us back to luggage pick up. Found AA baggage office, they say they will deliver my baggage some time at night. Tired from getting up early and flying all day, I am now expected to wait up for this."
1051," The flight from St Louis to Chicago via Providence was, by far, the best domestic flight I have ever been on. The staff were absolutely brilliant - the most accomodating, friendly, and humorous flight attendants. They were extremely attentive and made the flight seem even shorter than it was. They even brought some gifts over for the kids sitting behind me which was very sweet. The pilot kept us updated during the flight and provided a safe and smooth take-off and landing. He even saw us off the plane after we landed. I never had a favorite airline before but I will absolutely be flying American from now on!"
1052," Baltimore to Dallas with American Airlines. Paid for inflight internet and it barely works. Waste of $12. Not the first time either. Airline has turned into something like Spirit Airlines, nickel and diming you throughout the process. I’m already looking at other options for travel. My retirement certainly won’t be this brand. I’ll use my 157000 miles (hopefully they won’t ruin that too) and get out."
1053,"  West Palm Beach to Las Vegas via Charlotte. The ladies at the desk at Charlotte airport American Airlines were nothing but rude! It was late but I get that, it happens- but the ladies made an announcement if your looking to switch seats come to the desk, so with a seat 29B I was delighted! I go up and the lady looked at my ticket then smirked and was like your in basic economy “if you have the money is the only way I can switch your seat” -  ok lady, I am the customer what happened to the customer is always right or at least don’t be rude is all I ask. Then the other woman at the desk announced there is no food on this flight, so I go up and ask if there’s at least gonna be water. After speaking with her coworker, she was rude after a simple question based off of a bad comment she announced. American Airlines, hire more polite people or train your people better. Very displeased."
1054,"  Orlando to Orange County via Dallas. My flight from Orlando to Dallas was delayed, but I was able to obtain a seat on another American flight and make my Dallas connection. However, a computer program determined I would not be able to make the connection, cancelled my seat on the flight to Orange County, and assigned me to a flight the following morning. I received an automated email asking that I accept the next day flight or request another, which I did not respond to since I was able to get on another flight. I did discuss this with the gate agent in Orlando who apparently cannot override the computer's erroneous conclusion. American Airlines Customer Relations responded in writing to my complaint, but stands steadfast by the computer rather than the customer. American Airlines has attempted to reorganize from bankruptcy with a new logo and some new planes (although they remain among the older fleets). The Admirals Club staff are clearly trained to smile and great and offer assistance to customers. Unfortunately the Customer Relations staff appear stuck in the bankruptcy period, little imagination or motivation to attract and maintain customers."
1055,"  Salt Lake City to Lubbock via Dallas Ft Worth. In short, multiple occasions of poor communication at the airport, cancelled flights with hit an miss support, delayed bags after confirming they were on the flight, & rude employees during and after trip. My problem isn't as much that bad things happened, but how many and how the airline handled the situations. I even filled out the the survey that American Airlines sent me. Due to my responses, I expected that I would have been contacted by now (3 weeks later) with al least an email apologizing for the problems I had and appreciation for flying with them. As a result I feel it is important to share with others my experience. The problems started with a series of gate changes that had me bouncing around the airport at DFW. At one point there were people from 4 different flights at a gate trying to figure out if it was the gate they were supposed to be at. The monitors at the most of the gates did not show any information about the flight that was upcoming. This added to the confusion for my flight and others. Eventually my flight was cancelled. The next flight wasn't available till late morning the next day. The person at the gate was able to re-route my flight so I could meet up with the group I was going to road trip with. I received a hotel voucher for my overnight stay. When I called the hotel shuttle to pick me up, they informed me that they wouldn't send a shuttle. I told them I had a voucher from the airline for my stay. The hotel said that it didn't matter and I would need to talk to the airline for different arrangements. Many American Airlines employees & 4 hours later, I was finally on my way to a hotel I would have to pay for myself and submit a refund from the airline. Another person on the shuttle had many difficulties as he didn't have a cell phone to get messages about gates changing and flights cancelling. The lack of announcements and information at the gates was a serious concern. Once at my hotel, I called to confirm that my baggage would be rerouted with me to my new destination. The employee submitted a request, but said I would want to arrive early at the airport and talk to the baggage people in person. I arrived several hours prior to my flight and approached the baggage assistance counter. I stood at the counter being ignored by the employee for several minutes before she acknowledged my presence. She then asked me to wait a few minutes. When she was ready for me, I explained my situation, she seemed pretty annoyed, but she did pulled up my information and said that my bags are marked to be with me. I expressed concern because the lack of confidence from the employee the night before. She snipped at me and said they will be on my flight. (They didn't make it on my flight.) I proceeded to my gate. While waiting, I observed similar flight and gate confusion as the night before. Gate changes & people not being sure where they were really supposed to be. One particular flight only had one passenger on board and they were within a few minutes of needing to shut the gates for take off. I was only set to a few gates that morning. On the plane, the passenger next to me and I realized she had received texts from the airline directing her to gates that were different then the ones I received. We confirmed by looking at each others messages. Upon arrival I was informed that my bag was going to a different airport. I ended up having to replace the contents of my bag and submit reimbursement. Still hoping for refund."
1056,  Baltimore to Dallas Ft Worth. American has become the most unpleasant travel experience I’ve ever had. They just collect my money and treat me like a number; a meaningless number at that. It’s pointless to go into a great amount of detail because it won’t matter. Let’s just say I got some bad news from home and I was told to prove it. It was cold and callous. They didn’t get that I couldn’t get them the information until it was too late. They even told me they had available seats. Forget that I have flown them for 35 years and have accumulated hundreds of thousands of miles. They just don’t care.
1057,"  Miami to Zurich via Philadelphia. Second time the plane for the connecting flight suddenly had technical issues and we had to wait more than 3 hours for them to find a new plane. And of course every flight is overbooked and delayed because they have to find people who are willing to take a different flight. Also, better don’t think it will get any better once you are on the plane. The cabin staff is mostly in a bad mood and ignore you. Definitely not worth saving a couple of dollars flying with this airline!"
1058,"  
Medford to Los Angeles. Got here 2 hours early. Needed a wheelchair, waited 45 minutes before anyone came to help me. Still waiting for help. Requested wheel chair while making my reservation. Called to see if the airlines got my request. Got to Medford airport which is tiny. Still no wheelchair. No one was willing to help. Very scary feeling, when you're handicapped. If it wasn't one of two airlines that fly direct, I would never fly with them."
1059,Not Verified |  Flight was delayed because of technical difficulties which caused me to miss my connection to DC in Dallas and have to sleep there overnight. No American Airlines customer service rep or any of the ground personnel was concerned. I wasn't offered anything for the inconvenience which was entirely their fault. When I filed a complaint online I was offered a measly $100 voucher and was told that it was perfectly sufficient and they weren't going to do anything else. They have the worst customer service and I honestly believe that AA is one of the worst airlines in the United States currently.
1060," Not good service at all, no one was willing to help. Website says one thing, customer service says another thing — about changing flight to an earlier one, same destination and layover in Charlotte. This was a business trip and I will not choose to fly American Airlines again. Really rude on the phone while I was being nice. Folks at the airline counter were nice, but just told me to call. I just don’t understand why they wouldn’t even try to help a customer if they could."
1061,"  Washington to Milwaukee. My husband and I purchased airline tickets together months before, but when we checked in and received our seat assignment our seats were nowhere near each other! In all the years we have traveled together we have never been split up until this flight. I think this is terrible and a poor business practice. I will never fly this airline ever again. Airlines are a dime a dozen—there are more options out there than just you, American Airlines. Avoid unless you are traveling solo. This is not a family friendly airline."
1062,"  New York to Buenos Aires. The Flagship Lounge at JFK terminal 8 was very nice, with good selection of foods and wines. Check-in and boarding went smoothly. The seat was very comfortable. Cabin service, though was not at the level of premium Asian carriers, was pretty good. Cabin crew always showed up with a smile, and one can clearly saw that they were trying to provide upscale service. The big letdown was the food. I had better meals in economy with other carriers, and that was the first time I left my meal mostly untouched. Dessert was, however, pretty good, so that became my dinner. I had the exact same experience on my return flight from Buenos Aires, so this seemed consistent. What puzzled me was how AA let this minor thing ruined all other improvements they made. If AA simply improves in-flight catering the way they did with their lounges, I think they can be a 4-star (or even 5-star) airline."
1063,"  New York to Miami. The plane is old, the luggage compartments are small and there is  barely any leg room. There are no screens or TV and the service is horrendous. We are waiting over 25 minutes to get a gate in Miami and they dont let my children go to the bathroom. The flight up to New York from Miami was a disaster, they kept us on the plane for an hour with ac. Truly a horrific flight and airline."
1064,"Not Verified |  Dallas Ft Worth to Honolulu. American Airlines points are useless. I purchased a 1st class ticket (full fare) for my honeymoon. I used my miles for another ticket for my wife. I was also sold the upgrade to platinum level for about $800. Now we are on our way home and American lied to us and told us one of us was getting bumped to coach due to the flight being oversold, Come to find out my wife's seat was bumped because an AA pilot wanted to deadhead home in 1st class. No more American Airlines for me. I just cut up my card and also cut up my Citi aa card. Done with AA. "
1065,"  New York to Dallas Ft Worth. This was my first time flying American, as I am usually a Delta flyer, and this trip left much to be desired. The staff at the gates are very snippy, impatient, and borderline rude. I actually got angry at the treatment I felt myself and other passengers were receiving. The flights either left 45 minutes late or pulled away from the gate 15 minutes early. The seats feel like church pews. They kept it freezing in the cabin and when i asked for a blanket (which is standard with Delta) the stewardess informed me that I would need a business or first class ticket to get one. I  paid regular price) and strongly considered just purchasing a one way ticket back to California with Delta to avoid the extra grief of flying with American. Very poor experience."
1066,"  Dallas to Las Vegas. Airline is trash and disrespectful. They took our crew and put on another plane. I am never flying this airline, I prefer Frontier. We were given a $12.00 food voucher. They lied to us twice about a crew and we had no choice but to spend the night. They will not reimburse for a hotel but will give vouchers. Everybody had bad stories of this airline."
1067,"Not Verified |  Flew American Airlines from Boston to Savannah. This is one of the worst airlines I’ve flown, cancelled my flight 3 times and due to an emergency in Boston that was the airlines fault they made me reschedule my flight 2 times. This airline literally sucks and the people that work here don’t help either, never recommending them to anyone."
1068,Not Verified |  Two thumbs down for American Airlines. I flew American round trip from San Francisco to Costa Rica recently and though there were a few redeeming moments with them on the whole I would never recommend or choose American. Of the 4 flights (connecting included) there were stressful delays on each one and re-routing and departure time changes which added considerable travel time and made me miss appointments. My main complaint is that American seems to use scented air freshener in their cabin air system which every hour or so would come blasting through into the cabin. I happen to be physically very sensitive to chemical air fresheners and I know for certain that there are many people who are sensitive. We are trapped in the capsule at the mercy of someones decision to use this toxic scent (whatever it is). I got off the plane feeling ill and with lung irritation. My partner could smell it on me when giving me a ride home. He too is sensitive and it gave him a headache just from my clothing. It seems we are living in a new culture of air scenting from laundry detergent to garbage bags and everything in between. Hopefully they will realize that this is a bad move. Also because of their delay in one of my days of travel I did not have time to eat in my connection airport as I had to run to the gate. I was prepared to purchase food on board the 2nd flight of my journey only to find out they didn't have food to purchase (between Dallas and San Jose) which was the longest leg of my flight. Instead they had a wimpy and junk food like snack offering. What was with that? Also the headphone jack was broken on one of my flights so I couldn't use the onboard entertainment for a 6 hour flight. Overall I think American is the worst airline I've used and I travel fairly frequently.
1069,  Boston to Miami. American Airlines never fails to disappoint. It has gotten to the point where I book a flight a night before I would like to arrive because the chances of them getting me in on time is less than 10%. Every time it is due to a “maintenance problem” so I do not even get compensation for the time they have wasted. The only reason I am still buying flights from them is because they are the only airline that has a direct flight from Boston to Miami. This is the last time I make this mistake. It would actually be faster for me to have a connecting flight than to take this direct flight. This particular time the flight was delayed 2.5 hours. They made us get off the plane so that we could reboard in 20 min. I am still waiting for AA to give me a voucher or some sort of compensation for the last time I flew with them when my flight was delayed for 3 hours and as a result I lost my AA connecting flight (with an original 1hr layover) - they rebooked me to take another AA flight after an 8 hour layover. I ended up getting a new ticket on a different airline where my layover wouldn’t be half a day long. 
1070,"  Denver to Dallas. I felt like I was targeted during boarding from Denver to Dallas on 11/2/2018. They require you to check your bag at their notice without the consideration of my needs and the reasoning why I didn't pay to have my baggage checked. I was boarding the airplane when the ladies checking my boarding pass took my carry-on baggage. Their intention was just to check any bag without asking the traveler if there's a need. I asked for valet check in service and I was told no, but at the same time another traveler was granted such. AA assumes all responsibilities in the event somethings happens to me. After departing the airplane, I noticed several baggage were the same size or even bigger than my baggage but I was the first to pull to the side. There were even travelers with more than 2 items boarding the airplane but they were not asked to consolidate or to check one."
1071,"  Vancouver to Lima via Dallas Ft Worth. I was very pleased with all aspects of both legs of the flight to Lima.The departures were punctual, the seats and seat pitch were surprisingly comfortable and the meals were above average.The crew were are all friendly, courteous and efficient.The only shortcoming, which did not, which did not happen to bother me, was that in flight entertainment was extremely limited."
1072, Philadelphia to Northwest Arkansas via Chicago. Airline departs Philadelphia on time. Lands in Chicago at 0855hrs. The plane sits on the tarmac for 30min causing me to miss my connecting flight. I ran to my connecting gate to be told the gate was closed. I could see people inside the door. I knocked on the door to let them know I was outside. No response. I found a 'supervisor' and complained. She said she could put me on the next flight but said the problem was mine. I informed the supervisor that the airlines set the times. American Airlines is never on time. Never! American Airlines has got to be the worst domestic airline ever.
1073," Los Angeles to Charlotte. Why does it seem that every time I fly on an American Airlines operated flight the planes are broken. I'm always delayed due to something not working on the plane. Today, I was booked on a 0830 trip to CLT, but that didn't happen because it was broken. So after 3 and a half hours we got on the next flight out and surprise, surprise, that ones not working either. Thanks American Airlines for holding me up hours on my trips constantly."
1074,"Not Verified |  Dublin to Orlando via Philadelphia. I have an extremely bad fear of flying. The cabin crew could not have been more accommodating from the first minute. Re-seated us at no charge to a more comfortable section at the middle of the plane, and checked in regularly, explaining every noise and bump. Fantastic service and left me feeling incredibly grateful. No complaints about the comfort or level of service, all top quality for a bargain price."
1075,Not Verified |  Honolulu to St. Louis. Horrible customer service. Employee at the gate held up the line and made me “consolidate” my purse into my husbands laptop bag. 2 people get a total 2 carry ons and 2 personal items. We had 4 as we were allowed. No need to be rude and bossy. It’s not necessary. Flying is already stressful and uncomfortable. I don’t need rude employees making it worse. Flight was out of food. Dr Pepper. Both my original and return flights offered WiFi for a fee. Wasn’t able to use it. It was disconnected one way and cut out the other route. But they sure did take my money. Never American. Never again
1076," London to Chicago. I’ve arrived to Chicago and I realized that the stroller I was bringing to my grand daughter was broken. I contact American Airlines 2 days after my arrival to Chicago. They finally got back to me after 3 weeks! To make a long story short they refused to compensate me for something because I didn’t have the receipt from the stroller. In other works, according to AA, we have to keep all the receipts for purchases above $150 until the time we die just in case we will travel with them and they broke or destroy our personal items. This is unfortunately the customer service companies like American Airlines offer to their customers. Now, I have to buy a new stroller and apologize to my 3 year old grand daughter why she never received her favorite stroller. Shame on you AA."
1077,"Not Verified |  Tucson to Tokyo via Los Angeles. I recently took an AA round trip ticket to Japan. On all segments of the flight my husband and I never were seated together although we were booked together. You had to pay minimum an extra $40 for assigned seating. Those weren't cheap tickets to start with. Throughout the trip we had the chance to witness and talk to a number of couples who were experiencing the same thing. One case was so obvious. Where there were 3 seats, an American couple was split by a Japanese girl who was sitting in the middle. They asked her if she wanted to sit by the window and managed to travel side by side. In the automated check in stalls at the airport it was rather irritating how AA kept requesting whether we wanted to upgrade class, seating, meals etc. That is so low class behavior. I personally am not looking forward to travelling AA again."
1078,"Not Verified |  I will never fly American Again, this was the worst customer service ever. Six hours on the tarmac - after3 hours it was back to the gate by federal law, however not long enough to get something to eat, then back on the tarmac for 2 more hours. Ten finally we are ready for take off, the plane starts to throttle up on the runway but then suddenly throttles back and exits the runway, to be told the crew had been on duty too long to fly and it is only about a 40 minute flight. So then it was supposed to be back to the gate but there are no available gates. 1 more hour on the tarmac, no ac, the plane was way to hot. I could see from my window seat at least 3 empty gates probably not American. We were told many times the reason for so many delays, was Little Rock is a small airport, all the more reason to be adaptable. How companies respond to a problem is everything. "
1079,"  Chicago to Raleigh Durham. This airline nickel & dimes passengers for everything and penalizes us for purchasing an economy ticket by putting you in a middle seat in the back of the plane when you can finally check in online. My flight to Chicago I got stuck in the middle next to a non-stop burping passenger; my flight on my way back, I'm in the middle & praying i don't sit next to her or someone worse tomorrow. I can see their tactic which has only encouraged me to never fly American again. Why not put ticket prices that includes everything (overhead storage, seat selection, etc) as base price instead of separating everything? I can't believe any other airline (besides Southwest) could make United look good, I was wrong and greatly disappointed. If your gonna spend $$$ on a plane ticket, save some & don't go American. My experience was so bad I'm actually considering Delta for my next trip."
1080,"Not Verified |  Flew Fort Lauderdale to Charlotte via Tennessee. I was so disappointed with American Airlines, no TV unless you pay extra for the service. No wifi unless you pay extra. I paid $1000 for the flight so we should have recieved at least free wifi. My husband and I were traveling together and they put us in different seats and different rows. I had to ask other people on the flight if they would switch seats because I have a fear of flying and I need my husband there to be comfortable, I won't fly with American again."
1081," Charlotte to New York. The worst customer service I have ever experienced. This is the 3rd time I have tried this airline within the last year and for sure will be my last! Every flight was delayed which caused me to lose out on a $4,000 training. I am beyond upset I also called just to see if I can postpone my outbound ticket so I could make up the lost time no one returned my call. Then at the gate I asked for at least a simple seat upgrade and was denied this company does not care about their customers at all. Never fly American Airlines!"
1082," Washington to Miami. American Airlines is consistent with bad customer service, from the phone representatives to the the ticketing agents. You need to train your employees on proper communication etiquette and how to carry out good service. Each AA representative I have dealt with has been extremely unprofessional and just have an overall sense of not caring about the service they provide."
1083,  Flew from Dallas to Oakland via Phoenix. First flight delayed one hour but arrived only 3 min before connector flight but when I went to gate it was gone. They referred me to customer service counter and lady was rude when I told her I had to get home cuz my wife was having a baby at home and she didn’t even care. She said why don’t I Check with other airlines and I asked if I had to pay and she said yes. You would think since I paid for a ticket already and they made me miss connector that they would bend over backwards for everyone that missed. 
1084,"  Washington to Houston via Dallas Ft Worth. Evening departure on an older 737-800 with no entertainment system and average service nothing to mention about it, connected with a much newer 737-800 with an entertainment system. I must mention the super friendly flight attendant who was super pleasant and helpful."
1085,  New York JFK to Nashville. The most miserable flying experience I have ever had. The flight home was incredibly uncomfortable. It was so hot on the plane that the chocolates that we had bought in the airport melted. I will never fly again. Staff was less than friendly and would be better off working for TSA. Complete waste of money.
1086,"  Miami to Atlanta. Dont Ever fly with them. They lied to us on the phone when we called prior to our flight saying we would be able to keep our return flight if we chose to purchase a flight earlier than the original one. The day we went to check in they said they had cancelled our flight, wouldn't give refund, said we lied about ever calling. We have proof that we called. Said they wouldnt help us that the basic economy doesn't work like that. We followed their rules to a T and called prior to make sure and then told the day it was cancelled that we cant miss the first flight, although again it was approved ahead of time. They didn't even act caring, had to wait extreme times on the phone to talk to anyone. No one was helpful or even admitted they cancelled it, kept blaming someone else. If you want help dont fly with them! So were stuck on miami with no way home to my kids, unless we wanna pay another $360 just to fly home cheapest possible with them. "
1087,Not Verified | AA policy. I had a 9:30pm flight from Miami to Dallas. I arrived at the airport in time from a previous flight to catch a 6:30pm same flight. Despite being empty seats. They don't allow you to exchange the flight. They said there's usually $75 fee you can pay to change. I was not allowed to do this for unknown reasons. AA leading the way in not helping customers out.
1088," Jacksonville to Boston via Charlotte. If American Airlines didn't have such good credit card offers for mileage accrual, I would reconsider flying with them. I am a regular user of American because of convenience of routes and schedules, but I find myself turned off by their oddly convoluted (and long) boarding times, less than helpful ground staff, and overwhelmingly apparent cost-cutting. I purchased a premium seat online for one segment of my trip, and was charged accordingly. However, upon check-in, I was told the payment was not received and that I'd have to repay the $41.60 fee, and no effort was made to rectify the problem on the check-in staff's part. Dispute is still ongoing with my bank. Let's move onto the actual product though. The two aircraft I flew were definitely showing their age, but the new leather seating and adjustable headrests (737-800 models) were greatly appreciated and of good quality. Arrival and departure times were more than punctual and flight attendants were friendly enough, but the borderline harassment that ensues when 6 minutes of intercom time is devoted to credit card advertisement is definitely a turn-off. I didn't use the wifi, but I did use the stream-to-device entertainment, which worked well. There was also traditional overhead monitors available on the 737-800, playing standard sitcom fare. Overall it's an average experience, but a few factors such as aging planes and odd advertisements, along with cheap biscotti snacks and pricey buy-on-board options leave just the slightest bad taste in my mouth."
1089,"Not Verified | Philadelphia to Rome. On October 10, 2018, I had one of the most unpleasant experiences, in a long career in flying. When I checked in for AA 718, over two hours before the departure, I noticed that our seats were not assigned on the boarding passes. I thought this odd since I had selected our seats and paid extra for those seat selections. I checked the AA website and saw that a note that the flight was delayed 30 minutes, but I did not receive an email alert. We went to the assigned gate and 20 minutes before scheduled take off, it was announced that our flight was delayed, the gate was changed, and the plane was changed. Our seats, which I selected and paid $282 for extra leg room (it was a 7.5 hour flight), were not honored and we were assigned seats in the rear of the plane where we could enjoy the roar of the engines and a hint of jet fuel for the duration of the flight. AA's code sharing partner, British Airways, also foisted the ""change of plane"" and doomed us to horrible seats. I have a suspicion there was some consolidation of flights going on here. I checked the flight the day before and many seats were still available. The upshot of this is that I believe that AA changed to a plane with fewer seats and that our ""guaranteed"" seats were not honored. I am left wondering who sat in our seats, and why we were selected for inferior seats. If I am unable to feel confident that the seats I select and pay for will be available, why would I ever utilize American Airlines again? Please persuade me as to why I should fly American Airlines again, after this dismal performance."
1090,"  Philadelphia to Los Angeles. I had enough with American Airlines. It's now #2 on the list of worst airlines I ever used (#1 is Wamos, a Spanish airline). Their personnel on the ground (and in the air) is actually pretty helpful and their machines fairly simple to use, at least from my experience. But it's once you're onboard that you realize your mistake. I paid $1030 for a flight from LA to Reading and back, the same price I would pay for a trip to Europe, which is twice the distance. You'd think for that price you can get a minimum quality, even on economy. Wrong. For a start, you pay $30 for your first check-in luggage, and it grows exponentially! Totally outrageous. What this does, it makes everybody bringing carry-ons, overcharging the cabin with carry-on luggage, making it hard to find space above your seat for your luggage, so you have to put it in a totally different area (what a hassle to get it when you exit the plane!). No food for the whole flight (Yes, AA, I don't call food a couple of pretzels and a soda). If you want food, you have to pay for it. And what kind of food! Then, there is the entertainment: just as it seems to become a trend on the worst airlines, American Airlines forces you to use your own devices to be able to watch their programs. In their penny pinching minds, they automatically assume that everyone has a smart phone, or a tablet, or a computer. If you don't have any device on you, or your device is not compatible with their system (more on that later), you're out of luck. But the incredible part is, they don't even provide any electric plug or USB for you to plug in your devices! So, if all you have to watch movies onboard is your smartphone (which is already pitiful), and you need your phone battery fully charged for when you arrive at your final destination and need to call your friends, taxis, hotels, etc., again, you're out of luck. Now, let's talk about device compatibility with their onboard movie/TV system, which uses Flash Player. I did have a fully updated version of Flash Player on my computer, but their system kept saying it was not updated. After several attempts, since they were offering to download their own updated version of Flash Player, I decided to uninstall my version and replace it with theirs. Guess what? It still would not work. Their system would not recognize its own version of Flash Player on my machine! Unbelievable. I uninstalled and re-installed the app again, tried everything to get it to connect. Nothing worked. I spent the whole trip with no entertainment. Also, the cabin remained pitch black the whole time (you could barely see where you walked) which was very hard on your eyes when people constantly turned on their individual light or their computer screen. When we got to the luggage claim area at the airport, no indication anywhere of which carousel it was. When we finally found it, the previous plane had not even started their download, which made us wait for an extra hour. To top it off, I was carrying fragile items in a separate box. American Airlines made me pay an extra $200 (one way) because it was oversize. But the best part: they didn't put it with the oversize luggage (that are usually handled with a bit more care), they put it with the regular ones. Nothing was broken, but the whole experience really made me furious. The irony in all this is: AA is one of the only airline companies to wear the name: American. Aren't you ashamed, guys? You should be."
1091, Terrible customer service rebooking and flight cancellation policy’s are a joke. Was cheaper to rebook than to change a flight with more than two weeks notice. Customer service representatives have all been very unprofessional to talk to and will not be booking with American Airlines again.
1092," Miami to San Francisco. Absolutely awful! How is this airline still in business? I can't even believe how awful they are and expensive too. My flight was delayed 11 hours and there was no apology!! Just a deal with it attitude! No vouchers, no excuses, no apologies!! On top of that, a 5 hour flight offering a cold Turkey croissant for almost 10 dollars! Only choice!  Plus a bad movie, their choice. Hated it! Never again!"
1093,"  Milan to Miami. I flew the dreaded Basic Economy, and it was okay! I knew what I was getting into - no checked bag, no seat selection, boarding last - so there were no surprises. My expectations were low, and AA exceeded them generally. AA will not give you a boarding pass for flight segments until you arrive at that airport which is moderately annoying, but that was the only issue for me. There was plenty of overhead bin space on the international segments for my bag. I had a middle seat CLT-FCO but had an aisle seat MPX-MIA. Food was decent as was the on-board service. IFE gets low marks because there was no AVOD at all on the nearly 10 hour flight MXP-MIA. Apparently the 767-300 refurbs have not gone that far per a flight attendant. Also, in Economy there are no power ports; so your devices will quickly run out of juice. Bring an old-school paper book! In general the Basic Economy experience was not that bad, and I would do it again anytime I do not need to check a bag."
1094," Dallas to Grand Island. Every flight on my vacation was delayed. Customer service was completely disrespectful. How am I supposed to be a satisfied customer when nothing goes the right way, this is not the first time this has happened, but it is now the last time it will ever happen. Delay after delay. They have no excuses. All staff are lazy and works at there own pace. People have lives and families outside the chaos of airports, we have made commitments to get from 1 place to the next, and this airline wants nothing more but to take our money. This is so pitiful. I am so angry and have had 2 anxiety attacks because I had no where to go when things canceled. I am a patriotic American. And it pushes me off that the company American Airlines cannot uphold what we are as a country."
1095,"Not Verified | American just keeps getting worse and worse. I've flown American for the past 2 years on business. They used to have 2 classes of tickets, now they have 3. If you buy the old economy ticket you could upgrade to say and Emergency Exit row 1 hour before the flight. Now, with basic economy you can not. So, if the plane is half empty and you prefer to move, you can not, unless you pay an additional $60! Are you kidding? This after becoming a platinum member! Rude gate agents, horrible service, delayed flights, and horrible seats has driven me to fly another airline. Southwest is first on the list. Bye-Bye American! Don't waste your time with this un-American airline!"
1096," Flew American Airlines from Miami to New York City. Boarded the plane knowing full well we were delayed 2 hours. The pilot waited until everyone was seated to announce it. And to put salt in the wound, no service of any kind. Didn't see an attendant anywhere. Shameful and last time any of my family flies on this trap."
1097,"  Dallas to Santa Ana. Warning - do not travel economy in this airline. This means you will overpay, I ended up paying $ 500.00 for a flight I have made in JetBlue numerous times at a price of $97-$140. It guaranties that you will be seated in the last row and in the middle. Even when the plane is empty and they give others better seats free you will not be moved unless you pay extra. If you dare to request to be given another seat they reply “you are group 9 economy.” When I requested an explanation they just said you don’t get to change your seat. Someone booked this flight for me. Do not make this mistake."
1098,"  Had a 4 hour layover in Charlotte trying to get to Chattanooga. There was a flight leaving to Chattanooga in 30 minutes and the attendant verified there were 3 unsold seats on board. I was initially informed I could pay $75 to switch to the sooner flight no problem, but when my boarding pass was actually scanned the attendant flatly said I could not get on the earlier flight for any amount of extra cost. This was baffling and stressful, I am mainly upset because no explanation was given as to why I could not board the sooner flight. Sitting here for 4 hours when I know there are empty seats on the sooner flight. Thx AA"
1099,"  New Orleans to Los Angeles. My flight was delayed 3 hours due to the unavailability of a flight crew. While waiting at the gate to board, the pilot announced that we did not have a flight crew available in New Orleans and that we would have to wait 3 hours for a crew to be flown in from Dallas. American offered no compensation for this major inconvenience. I wrote several letters but American just sent a form letter saying how sorry they were!! I am frequent flyer with AA and was offered no additional compensation - not even some extra miles."
1100,"Not Verified |  We flew from Puerto Vallarta to Sacramento, with connected flight in Phoenix. We booked 2.5 hours available in Phoenix because we have to go through customs immigration (since flying from mexico). Our Flight from MX was scheduled 5:50pm and 1 hour delayed, we now have to fly at 6:57pm, meanwhile it's 7:25 pm we all seated on the plane and it still didn't move. Because of that we will have maximum 40 min between connected flights. My husband asked staff if possible to let us and others who are in same situation as us deplane earlier, all he got was a rude remark from her. Also after she made sarcastic comment without realizing that I was walking behind him. I'm pregnant, we travel with child and parents, at least I would expect some understanding and respect from crew, instead we got smacked in the face. I will continue review when we arrive to Phoenix."
1101, Tampa to Barcelona via Philadelphia. Our flight attendants were more concerned about their off time than our comfort. They asked us to move seats - then we realized they wanted to claim the two rows all the way across in the back for their own lounge. They even made us go down to the middle of the plane to use the bathroom so they could have the one in the back. One was great the other four were awful.
1102,"Not Verified |  What kind of airline makes someone pay $200 to change a flight? Life happens and no one should have to pay more than their ticket originally cost to change a flight even to the next day. My boyfriend and I are flying to see his family and we need to stay an extra day due to something, my original ticket cost more than the day that I needed to change to but in the end other than the $200 per ticket I also have to pay $50 per ticket because It was booked through a third party. Let me tell you something about an airline that puts their customers first, it’s not American Airlines. And honestly I’m not sure how great they do everything else but if I have to pay that much to switch I am never going to book with them again. I booked another ticket with southwest for the day because even though I won’t get my money back for the American airline flight I found a cheaper one overall with Southwest, who isn’t an airline I fly a lot but they have free flight changes so they just got themselves a new and very happy customer."
1103,"  Minneapolis to Charlotte. After experiencing a steady trend over the past several years in upward ticket prices and frequency of delay, I thought it was time to leave a review of American Airlines. I have recently experienced so many delays, resulting in missed connections, that I now find it preferable to fly to an airport 3 hours from my destination and drive the remainder. That is how unreliable airlines have become. Today, my flight has been delayed for two hours (so far), with a series of 3 increasing delay emails that began with a shorter predicted delay. After finding no information online about the reason for this delay (when airlines are usually eager to blame weather so everyone knows it's not their fault) I contacted customer service to inquire as to the nature of the delay. I was told ""maintenance issues"" after being on hold for over 10 minutes. I am writing this review in part to suggest a number of changes that AA could make to their service to dissuade negative reviews such as this: 1. If a delay is due to something that is the fault of the airline, and not the weather, state this honestly on flight status pages. 2. Maybe offer a voucher or other compensation when delays that are YOUR FAULT exceed two hours. Even something minor—like a seat upgrade or free wifi—would be better than nothing, and deter disgruntled passengers from boycotting your airline (which I am seriously considering at this point in time). 3. Change the ""on hold"" music to something with slightly better sound quality. Also, we do not need to be reminded of AA advertisements and ""Please continue waiting"" every 30 seconds. This is incredibly distracting and irritating when people are already irritated. 4. On your website's ""Your Trip"" section, clearly display the arriving aircraft's departure status, so that customers can click on the delayed flight and see where it's coming from and whether it's departed. This is an incredibly obvious thing that helps patrons gauge how long a delay is likely to last, or whether a cancellation is imminent. Other airlines already do this, but AA forces people to use better flight tracker services to check the status of the arriving aircraft. Unless some of these things change, I will not be using American Airlines any longer, and will recommend all of my friends, family and colleagues do the same."
1104,  Boston to Dallas Fort Worth. Ground employees extremely rude including check in and gate staff. American needs to work on service excellence. Will fly Jet Blue next time. They are known for great customer service. American has lost my business.
1105,"Not Verified |  Flight was 8 hours late. No vouchers given or even a simple we are sorry for the inconvenience. Terrible service both at the airport and in flight. After waiting 8 hours to take a flight and already missing my brothers wedding, I was treated extremely poorly and was told that I should pay more attention to putting my bag under my feet than looking at my phone. My phone that I was texting my family on to tell them that I will not make it to the wedding. I will never fly AMERICAN again."
1106,"Not Verified |  Austin to Montego Bay via DFW. Boarded the flight with no initial delay, 10 minutes after flight was scheduled to depart, the captain informed the flight via intercom that someone spotted a dent on the plane - maintenance allegedly told him that it would take about 15 minutes, then he would update us. After 30 minutes, it became indefinite. At this point, we had no chance of making the connection to MoBay. I called AA Customer Service, which was a joke; the rep kept telling me about overnight layovers and deplaning, which is not the airline’s fault, because they need to keep us safe. “So whose fault is this and who compensated me for my nights loss, transportation, etc?” “We have no control over that...” She said. The point is that this airline is not proactively maintaining the aircraft. No my vacation time and hard earned money are lost and they don’t have the decency to offer any type of reimbursement, not even a drink of water. The toilet facility on the aircraft is filthy and the attendants are sitting down with their feet kicked up. We’re on the plane as I write, wasting our lives away while they get paid. Never again! I rather take Southwest, and I hate Southwest."
1107,"Not Verified |  On March 24 of this year I flew on AA 1839 from Washington to Dallas Fort Worth. Since this flight was a short hop there were no meals served, just American's biscoff. The flight attendants seemed very nice and helpful, check in at DCA was very simple in painless, there were kiosks with staff roaming the check in area collecting baggage and helping out with any issues, from parking to being at the ate took me about 45 minutes. Once we reached DFW the staff at the gate were very helpful in finding where my connection was. I would fly with American again."
1108,Not Verified |  LaGuardia to Dallas. Worst airline ever! I always fly Delta but had no choice but to fly American Airlines to Dallas and it’s the worst. They always have huge delays and issues and wont provide you with any information or approx time of departure. The staff are rude even when the airline has inconvenienced me. I’d rather fly Spirit.
1109,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Philadelphia. Terrible support and accommodations on-flight. No room was provided for my carry on. It should not have to be a concern of the flyer to ensure that personnel use proper storage room. Flight attendants or crew members should ensure flyers use proper storage. Instead all flyers group 6 and back were asked to check their baggage.  I have important documents, work laptop and information to keep on me and was not allowed due to running out of room. I will request I never fly American aAirlines through military again. Completely let down, I have flown with this airline numerous times and have always been allowed to keep my bag even when ""no room"" was available. The lady at the desk was extremely rude and not willing to listen at all. Just got told to please handle it when you arrive at Philadelphia. So much for your customer service. This was terrible and can not any longer recommend your airlines for flying to others."
1110,"  Honolulu to Salt Lake City via Los Angeles. Worst customer service I have experienced. My wife and baby went to the counter and checked in and the woman at the counter in Honolulu airport told my wife that I had five minutes to get there or I wouldn’t be able to board the plane. So my wife called me right then and I was there two minutes earlier than the five minutes because I sprinted from my car rental drop off after she told me that. When I arrived at the counter (three minutes earlier than the five minute cut off she gave my wife) she said in the most demeaning tone “you’re not going to be able to board the plane” and it felt as if she loved telling me that. I said “why?” And she said “because you didn’t make the cut off“. I looked at my watch and I said “yes I did, look at the time” and I showed her the time on her computer screen which was one minute earlier than the cut off time. She said in a sarcastic voice “I’m sorry there’s nothing I can do“. I said “can I speak to your manager“? And she laughed and said “she’s not going to help you“. She came back after like 15 seconds and said “told you, you’re not getting on the plane“. I asked her why she seemed to not be interested in helping us and told her it seems like she didn’t care.  She just kept saying “it’s under the terms and conditions” and “you shouldn’t have agreed.” I will never fly American Airlines again. Because of some cut off that I wasn’t even actually late for. "
1111,"Not Verified |  One of the worst flights ever.  We flew from San Francisco to Rome via Chicago. First they didn’t allow us to checkin online unless we selected seats for which we needed to pay like 30-40 Dollars per seat per leg of the flight. That means it costs like 150-160 dollars for just selecting a regular economy seat. Then when we reached the airport, we tried checking in the kiosk. It said assistance required and there was no one around. Then we went to a counter and checked by bag which cost 60$ for a single bag(wow). Then first flight from San Francisco to Chicago was delayed by 1 hour. That was after boarding. We barely made it 10 minutes before our boarding started for our next flight from Chicago. Then after sitting in the flight for 30 minutes they started saying that some maintenance was required for the flight and now it has been already more than 2 hours and we are still waiting. They are not even letting us off the plane."
1112,"  Chicago to Wichita, 1hr 32 mins late arriving. Worst airline in the business, delays and other issues, aircraft are cramped and uncomfortable. I would not be flying them, but my company booked the flight. Truly a disgrace to airlines, I'm not  sure how an airline can screw up so badly and so often."
1113,Not Verified |  Buffalo to Charlotte. Worst airline to fly with! This is now our second time this year for our flight to be delayed causing us to miss our connecting flight thus missing very important events that we paid a lot of money to be at. To “accommodate us” they gave us a 10% hotel discount for a hotel that was over $150 a night and sent us on our way. Absolutely unacceptable. And now that I’m reading the reviews I see that it’s a very common thing with this company. Will never be flying through this Airline again and suggest you not to if you want to make it on time wherever you are going.
1114,Not Verified |  Phoenix to Monterey for a wedding. We were in a 10am flight. Got on a plane and they told us to get out because of technical issues. I was asking what is going on because no one was giving us information and they told me to go sit down in a very rude way. We waited and then they cancelled the flight. I went to costumer service to ask to fly somewhere else and I got yelled there as well saying it is not their fault. They put in on 1:45pm flight. Flight was delayed because they could not find the pilot. Nobody was taking responsibility for this. We missed the wedding. We had a hotel there and could not be given our money back. Worst experience ever.
1115,"Not Verified |  Will not fly American again. Flew Friday 10/12 from Bradley International Airport, Hartford CT to Richmond VA via Charlotte NC. Flight delayed 30-45min from Bradley to Charlotte. We had a 1:45 min layover so no big deal. Flight from Charlotte to Richmond delayed 30 min. Trying right now to get home. Was supposed fly from Richmond to Hartford via Philadelphia. Flight from Philly to Hartford canceled. Rebooked from Richmond to Hartford via Chicago. Flight from Richmond to Chicago delayed 30min. In Chicago right now. Flight from Chicago to Hartford thus far delayed 1:15 min and changed gates in O'Hare from one end of Terminal 3 to the other end. Funny aside, the original flight we were booked on from Richmond to Philly was supposed to leave at 1500. Over loud speaker, ""Last call for such and such flight to Philly"" at 1530! So that flight was delayed too. I have flown Delta for years and very few issues. Unfortunately, there was not a convenient flight on Delta for this quick trip so decided to try American. Will never do that again. They are truly a comedy of errors and pathetic-ness."
1116," The worst airline I have dealt with. My flight was delayed for 10 hours, they didn't send an email or call to let us know that there was a delay. I came with a group of 5 to the airport and when you tried to check in the system showed us that there was a delay and all the American Airlines offices were closed. We have been waiting for the assistance for 3 hours to try to find at least a place to stay in because it was 3 am and we arrived at the airport at 12 am but they were disrespectful and they didn't even gave us a place to stay and it wasn't our fault. They didn't care about their customers."
1117,  Norfolk to Philadelphia. Charlotte with American Airlines at Norfolk was the most helpful associate I have ever had. She was able to do things at the gate that the customer service counter said they couldn’t and was able to get me in my wife’s flight. Thank you.
1118,"Not Verified |  
I will try not to ever fly American Airlines again. I say try, because sometimes it can't be helped and that's the only business they deserve. There was only 1 gate agent in San Antonio that was wonderful. We arrived Phoenix thinking we were going to be running, flight crew did not announce the gate the plane parked at. We run off to find out that we were at the correct gate. Could have stayed on the plane. Asked the gate agent at gate 2 at 4.30pm MST in Phoenix if there were any upgrades since I have long legs. She immediately said no and didn't look. I was not asking for 1st class, just a row with more legroom. If I can post the pictures I took of how many open seats including the ones on the front row by the wall with about 6 more inches. She didn't even take the time to look, instead stood there talking to an airport employee in red shirt. We heard the conversation and it wasn't about anything work related. The flight crew on the flight from San Antonio to Pheonix were rude, like we were their last flight. Guess what, we were, imagine that, horrible service! Do not fly American Airlines!"
1119,"  Los Angeles to New York JFK. Lovely service and lots of space even for a little snooze and had fun watching the first 5 episodes of the (US version) of The Office (why not more?!). Only complaint concerns the pre-booked meal - I'd chosen shrimp avocado toast - it consisted of 2 slices of toast, 2 shrimp and about 1 tbsp of avocado - more of an appetizer than a main dish! Fortunately I'd had a gorgeous fruit plate at Flagship Dining in LAX, or I would have been forced to eat the entire basket of onboard snacks otherwise. Really excellent flight with friendly and efficient service"
1120," Washington to Atlanta. I am going to stop being completely loyal to American for flying. I only have gold status but am flying a lot next year so would probably get higher. I don’t see the reason to stay with American. My last two flights in a row with American have been canceled. The first after sitting on the tarmac for three hours and the second after sitting on the tarmac for 5.5 hours. Although it was weather related, it shows very bad planning and a disregard for people’s time. They could have canceled earlier on when you knew the situation was so poor. The flight I’m on now has six open seats in first class and I wasn’t upgraded. Which just confirms my belief that they don’t value my business. In fact when my last flight was canceled I rebooked with Delta for the following morning and was impressed with the new plane even though I was sitting in a middle row in the back. I don’t remember the last time I was in a new plane with AA. They may be the largest airline (as I hear you often boast) but this can change when you take your business for granted."
1121,"Not Verified | Phoenix to Bradley via Charlotte. The worse experience we ever had on an airline. Terrible service from check in to departure. The majority of employees of American Air Lines were rude, uncaring and very disinterested in the needs or wants of the fliers. The only exception was a Supervisor. We booked our flight and expected to be seated together, we weren't, I paid an extra $40 dollars to sit near my wife and the machined malfunctioned and seated us in different rows. After being told I had to pay another $40 dollars to change seats, the supervisor kindly corrected the situation. American Air lines is an airline we will avoid ."
1122," Phoenix to Newark. They changed the take off time twice, pushing it back. Then they decided to change the time and make it sooner. I went to the gate several times and it was empty of people. Each time they said take-off will be 10am. They ended up shutting the doors at 9:20 and we almost missed the flight. The staff at the door was extremely rude, argumentative and was fixated on blaming us for her faults. She threatened to not let us on the plane, because I confronted her about her rude behavior. I’m very unlikely to fly American Airlines now unless absolutely necessary, I will chose another airline."
1123," London Heathrow to Washington DC via Philadelphia. I can’t believe the negative reviews on here! Please don’t listen! Before I booked my flight with American Airlines, I came on this website and I was about to cancel my flight, thank god I never did! Inhad an amazing flight with American Airlines. Flight was on time, the crew were absolutely lovely, the food was delicious. The crew kept on coming to give us snacks and even ice cream. The wine was lovely and they kept topping my glass. Before we landed to Philadelphia they served us pizza. I always fly out with Virgin Atlantic when flying to America however, from now on it will be only be American Airlines! I just want to thank the lovely crew on flight AA729! Please don’t listen to the bad reviews."
1124,"Not Verified |  Purchased 2 First Class tickets for Washington Dulles to LAX to Puerto Vallarta. Dulles flight had mechanical issues, but was canceled 3 hours later, gate agent immediately rebooked us on a Washington National Airport to Dallas w/connection to PVR. Upon arrival in Dallas, airline partner refused to honor tickets & told us to talk with American airlines. American airlines customer service desk said ""Yes, we're having a very difficult time getting them to honor the tickets, we've told corporate., I guess they're trying to work on it."" We were booked on a flight on for Mexico City with a connection to PVR. That flight too had mechanical problems, but took off 1 hour late. After going through Immigration in Mexico City, we had only 30 minutes to get to the connection; when we arrived at the gate, they refused to honor the tickets & sent us to the AeroMexico ticketing desk. AeroMexico refused to do anything but simply referred us back to international terminal & American airlines desk. At the desk, the agent was able to see all of the issues which had occurred, told us there were no flights until the next day at 7am & provided a voucher for a meal (at 10:30pm) and a night at a Mexican hotel adjacent to the airport. The next morning we were at the airport by 5 am for the 7am flight to Puerto Villarta. It took American Airlines, and their partners, 29 hours and 5 airports to complete a 6 hr flight. Upon my return, I was informed by American airlines they were crediting 10,000 miles and were sorry for our troubles. They did not reimburse us for the difference between the First Class tickets we paid for (but never received First Class, sold out) on our journey to Mexico. Really terrible customer service, obviously they don't care!"
1125,Providence to Los Angeles via Philadelphia. This was the worst travel experience I've ever had. I missed my connection in Philadelphia due to a maintenance issue on the plane. I landed at 8:52pm and was told by customer service in Philadelphia the next flight out was not until the next morning at almost 9:00am. I was looking at a 12 hour layover so obviously I wanted to stay in a hotel. I was told I would have to pay out of pocket by customer service. I had to argue for a while that it wasn't my fault the connection was missed and that I shouldn't have to pay out of pocket for the hotel. After the customer service agent agreed to give me a free hotel stay she said all of the vouchers were already given out. She then told me I could purchase my own and I would be reimbursed. There is a hotel attached to the Philadelphia airport and their cheapest room was $313. After taxes and fees it came out to $364. Since I was told I was getting a reimbursement I didn't think it mattered how much I paid. At that point I purchased my own hotel and the next day e-mailed American Airlines for my reimbursement. An agent e-mailed me the next day telling me I would not be getting a refund. After arguing my case over e-mail and the phone I was then told I would be getting $120 back. I have been trying for days to get the rest of the reimbursement but have been told multiple times the maximum reimbursement for hotel stays are $120. It doesn't seem to matter that I was told I would be getting a full reimbursement. The fact that they are willing to lose business over $244 is so crazy to me. This is the worst customer service I have experienced and I will not be giving them my business or recommending them to anyone anymore.
1126,"  Belize to Denver. I was surprised to learn there is zero leniency when it comes to change fees. I booked flights about two weeks ago to do a volunteer opportunity. Another opportunity arose, and I was hoping to change one flight. As a student, budget is very tight. Even though my flights are two months away, there was no leniency. When airlines like Southwest have no change fees, I’m disappointed there were no better options than charging me $200 to change flights to another American Airlines Flight!"
1127, Memphis to Jackson Hole. If you want to be on time go somewhere else. Everytime I have flown American it has been delayed or canceled. I have no idea why this company is allowed to treat its customers like this! Any other business would be shut down!
1128," New York to Dallas. My flight was scheduled to leave at 5:40a.m. We arrived at the airport at 3:30a.m. and after going through security we stood in a long line for at least 30 minutes just to get thru to the terminal. We finally made it to the terminal to board the plane and was told to stand to the side because due to computer issues we weren't assigned seats. We waited on the side as directed and watched everybody board the plane. I walked up to the counter and asked the rep what was going on and she said ""oh, I forgot about you"". We paid for our tickets just like everyone else did and should have been treated with the same respect as everyone else. We were given the last 2 seats in the back of the plane. I don't mind sitting in the back but the service we received was not good at all. This was totally unprofessional!"
1129," 
Miami to Los Angeles. The way people engage with customers is horrendous. Happen to be rude enough to complain that I had paid extra for a seat and didn’t want to check in my bag because I should be able to put it where the seat I paid for is situated. The rude, unprofessional, ridiculously unhelpful man they gave a suit to and a title said if I complain I can go on another plane. Talentless. He is being rude to someone behind me as I type."
1130,"  
Baltimore to Miami. I had an issue with American Airlines canceling my flight for November 2018 without my acknowledgement. Was very upset when I called, the agent Nina helped me right away. Fixed my flight and was very helpful. Customer service was great. Handled my issue right away. Thank you Nina for all your help through my stressful moment! "
1131,"  
Toronto to Houston. It was my first and last time with American Airlines. My wife and I had 1 bag 2 carry on and they could not deliver our baggage! They took our 2 carry on as well which my wife had her medicines in it. We should have not trusted them. It was definitely our last experience"
1132,"  Tucson to London via Dallas Ft Worth. Twice I have paid for Priority Boarding and get group 6 which is the same group I get when I don't pay for an upgrade. 3 of the 5 legs of the flight to and from were late. I paid extra for better seating and got different seats than what I paid for and rude service when I asked why the response was ""sorry sir, we are full and had to move people around"". Then where is my refund? Land back at home and baggage missing. They said they would deliver to my house and that I have to be home. I was told it would arrive at 6 am. Just prior to going to bed, I get a notification that it would be there at 5:07 am - great! So I wake up at 4:30 am and finally leave at 7:30 to go to work with no bags. I call the airline to tell me they don't even pick up bags from the airport until 8 am or noon, then why the notification updates! If something could go wrong with an airline, American Airlines knows how to do it. Absolutely never again!"
1133,"  Birmingham to Buffalo. This was the first time I flew with American Airlines, and I have to say it was the most pleasant experience I have had flying. It was wonderful. From now on I will do all my flying with American Airlines. Thank you for making my trip so enjoyable."
1134,"  Cancun to Seattle via Phoenix. I don’t know her name, but I had the best experience with one of the employees who went way above and beyond her call of duty. We were waiting in the customs area and I had a rescue dog with me. She was worried about our connecting flight and personally showed us the dog area which was a good 10 minute walk from where we were. Then she directed us up to ticketing where she took care of checking her back in for the connecting flight. I would not have known where to go. Thank you for being so awesome and I will definitely fly American from now on."
1135,"  Boston to Madrid via Philadelphia. The worst airline I have ever used. Our flight from Philadelphia (which was a stopover) to Madrid was delayed because the IT people did not cross check the numbers against those on the actual plane. The delay was for more than 2hrs. Then an AA customer manager comes onboard and promises everyone on the plane that all our connection flights will be rescheduled automatically to the next available time by the time we reach Mardid. This was a plain outrageous lie. We were standing in an enormously long line at the AA desk at Madrid airport where basically all passengers from this flight went to, trying to get their connecting flights rearranged. Because nothing was arranged for anyone. In addition, we were told that all flights to the island were booked and they could not accommodate us on that day (we arrived around 10am in the morning). so they booked us for the next (!) day and put us in a hotel. Only the AA agent 'forgot' to tell us that there were NO SEATS and NO GUARANTEE that we were going to fly the next day! We nearly did not make it the next day because the flight was FULL! We had to wait with a little kid until everyone boarded and basically begged the staff to let us in. In addition, this flight was at 9pm which meant that we lost 2 days in Madrid, away from our main destination. In addition, our hotel in Tenerife did not cancel our missed day and we had to pay extra 500 Euros for the day we were not there. When we emailed the AA and asked them to reimburse us for the missed hotel day, cab rides that we did not intend to take, they rejected it stating that we simply had an inconvenience and nothing more than that. I am glad that we did not waste our money booking first class seats. Terrible AA agents across the board, whether in person in different countries, on email or on the phone! It is better to pay extra and book it via another airline than with AA! Do not waste your money."
1136,"Not Verified |  Bradley International to Fort Myers. American Airlines has been one of the worst airlines I’ve ever flown. I’ve had countless experiences where the flights have been delayed. I actually can’t think of a time that the flight was on time. I write this as I wait for my once again, delayed flight. I fly American because they are cheap. However, I will consider paying the extra $20 to fly an alternative airline. I also often find myself in a puddle jumper for the first half of my flight (before connection). There’s no leg room and I’m honestly surprised some of these planes are still running. Zero stars for American."
1137,"  San Francisco to London via Philadelphia. Bought ticket on British Airways but flight was operated by American Airlines. Full plane, I got a seat where someone had broken off the headphone jack in the armrest so 5+ hours with no entertainment. Gate attendant for connecting flight yelled at me loud enough for all to hear for standing where I could see a computer screen that she had left on and unattended. I thought no company could ever rival United Airlines for incompetence, but AA seems to be trying."
1138,"  Flight got delayed by 1.5hrs from Austin to New York and so I just had 1 hr layover in New York I asked the air hostess if I can go to front seat she said go when pilot announces landing. I am not interested in going to front seat, I was late because of u guys and that's why had to go out of plane early. As I got out I asked one of the American airline person to tell at the gate that if I am late of they can hold the connecting flight and his reply was: you do it!"
1139,"  Las Vegas to Charlotte. This is the fourth time I have traveled American Airlines over the last month. My wife and friend have also flown in the recent month on this airline. Every one of our trips has delayed flights and missed connections. I tried flying our dog. Don’t even bother. They will give you the run around so much that it’s a full time job. Oh, and if you miss your flight because of them and they can’t get you out, too bad, sleep in the airport all night. This airline is a joke. They are neglecting their customers and quality aircraft maintenance. All so they can make more money, even when gas prices are lower. Do not fly this airline, you won’t make it where you need to go on time."
1140,"Not Verified |  Dallas to Honolulu. We paid for the premium economy seats both ways & did not get them either time. I’m 6-3 and would have just flown on an other flight if they would have been honest about the seating arrangements. To make matters even worse, the charges (about $500) were not automatically refunded. We contacted American multiple times and eventually filed a dispute with the credit card company after getting a constant runaround. It’s now October and we have only received the Money back for one of the three seats that they charged us for. Complete scam and worst customer service ever. I will travel by car or ship before I ever use this airline again."
1141,Not Verified |  Rochester to Chicago via Minneapolis. Flights were delayed from 6pm getting out of Rochester. In Chicago they were delayed and delayed and at 2am it was cancelled. My next option was 4pm. Horrible and there is no excuse you can make. I rented a car at 2:30 am. I should have done that 6 hours ago. Horrible!
1142, Phoenix to Lexington via Chicago. Terrible flight. Multiple delays. Rude flight attendants. Uncomfortable seats. Expensive fares. Gets worse every time I fly. I am very dissatisfied and unimpressed.
1143,"  Sacramento to Dallas Ft Worth. As uncharacteristic as it is for me to rant via social media, I think my years of airline travel and airline frustration have officially come to a head. In traveling to see my wife for our 1 year anniversary, I made the mistake of choosing American Airlines for the final time. In the last two years my wife and I have flown with them, we've had nothing but issues. Lost baggage, overcharged baggage fees for bags even while on military orders (which most airlines waive), being removed from flights because of the possibility of our connectors potentially not arriving on time, and just a general sense of ""I dont care and you're a nobody"" exuded from the employees. Finally, we have today's ordeal. I arrived at Sacramento International at a little past 7 am. My flight was scheduled to depart at 8:05 am. I arrived at the ticketing area at 7:18, and after a couples minutes of finding my record number, I began to punch in my numbers. At 7:21 am, I was told that I had the choice of either getting on a later flight or departing with carry-on only. Not knowing exactly what the issue was, I went to the counter where I was told that I was too late to travel with bags (by one minute), so I would have to be placed on standby for the next flight 4 hours later. This would delay my final arrival time by 6 hours. At this point I very politely asked if there was any way I could make this flight, being that I was only 1 minute past the 45-minute deadline. I was told that I had to travel with my bags and that they couldn't take my bag due to this 45-minute rule and that I couldn't just have them take it and wait for it to arrive on a later flight. I begged for them to make an exception so I wouldn't placed on standby, but I was told that there was nothing they could do, which means that my entire first-anniversary weekend is currently hanging in the balance because of 1 single minute. Needless to say, I had no choice but to take the later flight and I will now spend the rest of the day hoping there is a spot for me, which brings me to this. How, in a time of jobs being lost to automation, can a company insist on being so rigid that no employee can use basic customer service skills to work this out? If their hands are so tied that they can't override something as minuscule as this, what can they do? And if they do have this ability, what song and dance is required to get said employees to just let it go? It seems that there is a serious issue with this company in almost every way except two: maintenance and the pilots. I can only attest to those two being quality due to the fact that, in the time I have traveled with American Airlines, the planes have always made it in one piece and I'm alive to write this. I just believe it's time that American Airlines finds a way to do better. If my wife and I have dealt with this numerous times, all within the last 18 months, how many times has this happened to others? I know you are probably thinking, ""Mike, just fly with another airline,"" and from now on, I'll respond, ""I sure will."""
1144,"  Jacksonville to Dallas Ft Worth. We were in Jacksonville FL for a wedding during the hurricane Florence though Jacksonville was not affected, it affected American's operations. 24 hours before the return flight I went to the American Airlines website to check our flights and the website crashed followed by your tickets are cancelled. Naturally I went into shock as many people in Jacksonville were staying in the city from the cities affected by the hurricane. On a good note because I am admiral club member I could reach AA customer service with in five minutes but the customer service could not rebook me and said email customers relation for a refund. I also tried at the airport on departure with same story email customer relations for a refund. On a side note I keep airline miles with Delta and others so I was able to rebook myself on Delta back to DFW with out having to buy a last minute ticket. Once home in DFW I took the skytrain to terminal A and asked American again and got the same story. Finally once home I emailed AA customers relations and to my surprise I got everything worked out. I did get a refund on all 3 tickets and even a thanks for being a loyal customer for 11 plus years with status. So in the end AA took care of the issue and did the right thing. I cannot really blame them for the website issues as to the hurricane and one of there main Hubs getting affected."
1145,"  I can't stress enough how terrible this airline is. In our experience (and we travel a lot) they are the worst airline available. Our flight was late departing, and we arrived in Chicago with 30 minutes to get to our connecting flight. The airline refused to assist passengers with connecting flights in any way. In my past experiences with other airlines, they would do what they could to assist, such as allowing passengers with connecting flights off the aircraft, and not making them pick up their checked bags and recheck them. The airline did none of these things. They then checked our bags on with our original flight, and when we got to the gate early, the plane had left. Not only did they refuse to wait the few minutes, they left early. They then put us a flight that was three hours later. When I spoke with the airlines staff about my experience, they were unfathomable - completely rude. They indicated none of this was their problem or responsibility, and even yelled at me for suggesting they shouldn't have checked our bags if they weren't going to hold the flight for five minutes. When I asked for their names or employee numbers, they refused to provide them. It was an utterly terrible experience, not my first with them, but it will definitely be my last."
1146,"  Indianapolis to Dallas via Little Rock. First thing, my email confirmation told me baggage was free. Went to check in, was rudely told by a man, it would be $90 to check 3 bags. I only had cash, and was again rudely told credit only. Had to find another counter to talk to a different person, he dismissed us quickly with no help. Was able to find a woman that quickly told us the only way to take care of this to purchase a card there, extra $5 to get card. Flight attendants weren't friendly, but weren't rude. Then in Dallas, horrible. Plane was delayed, on the taxi way for over 25 min, only told it was maintenance issue. But worst part was the flight attendant. There were 2. 1 for coach 1 for first class. Ours was so cold, rude, one word answers. I had to use rest room, it was occupied, she quickly told me ""sit down there"" and pointed to empty seat. After already being so rude. The most rude, ridiculous trip ever. Will never book with American Airlines again."
1147,"  I am really upset by my whole experience with American Airlines. I flew from London to Lima with a long lay over in Dallas. Cabin crew on London to Dallas were ok, but pretty rude and noisy on the flight from Dallas to Lima. I was mainly shocked by the crew from Lima to London, on my way back. They were very rude with all the passengers, shouting at us, being very nervous and horrible. Also the flight in itself was a really unconfortable experience, it is nearly a 7 hour flight with no aircraft entertainment (no movies). Food it is disgusting and cheap, there is not a vegan option. To complete my experience, my luggage was lost, sent to Japan because apparently my tag number was the same as someone going to Japan. They lost it for 3 days, and I had to call them back twice a day to check the status of my luggage, as no one bothered to contact me regarding this matter. It is supposed to arrive today, but no one knows what time it will be here, so I am obliged to stay home all day waiting for it, which is a total joke. I will never fly with them again, even if they are the cheaper option."
1148,"  London to Portland via Charlotte. I rarely fly AA and will avoid doing so at all costs in the future. While the rate was decent, that was the only positive experience out of 4 flights. The trip was from the US to London via Dallas going, and Charlotte returning. AA was the operator for British Airways for the first 3 legs. For check-in, I attempted to do this via the mobile app and online. The message I got was that since they are operating the flight for BA, that I needed to do check in with BA, and gave me an option to redirect to their site. Fine. But once there, BA said I had to check in with AA. Anyone see the problem here? Not having the ability to check in electronically is incredibly stupid in the year 2018. Checking in at PDX was fine, as I was at least able to use the kiosk. Checking in for the return trip at Heathrow was not fine. The kiosk took me through the entire process and gave a message at the end stating I had to see a customer service representative. To say that these reps were slow would be an understatement. It took them 45 minutes to process the roughly 5 people / groups ahead of me. 45 minute delay at an already notoriously slow airport. Thanks, AA. On-board, I would characterize the attitudes of the flight attendants as varying between indifferent and rude. They don't seem to be trained that they are in the business of serving customers, not belittling them. I felt like a number, when other airlines seem to treat people with respect. Getting bags was a chore as well, as AA doesn't seem to care about connection times, and takes a really long time to get bags out onto the conveyor. Other airlines can do this faster, so why can't AA? One can only guess they don't really care. Avoid AA. There are options out there. Vote with your dollars."
1149,  Panama City to Miami. Please help me understand this delay? I was told that you didn’t have gas to you the jet and that was the reason for the delay. We have been sitting in a very hot plane now for 90 minutes. I don’t my mind a delay but what I really don’t appreciate is rude service. I have a hard time believing that the lack of fueling up this jet caused an 90 minute delay from departing on time. On top of everything else I asked for a water and Was told to remind in my seat. 
1150,"  My family and I flew from Sydney to Los Angeles on September 8, 2018 before connecting to Toronto. We travel to North America every year and it was the first time we flew American Airlines. We were pleasantly surprised as to how enjoyable the trip was! The cabin crew were friendly and very helpful. We were due to fly back from LA to Sydney on September 21, 2018 but we missed our connecting flight on that day due to some issues with our flight from Toronto to LA (which Air Canada did not want to bear any responsibility) We were re booked on the next day. Upon our arrival at terminal 4 at LA airport, we were lucky enough to deal with a staff member and asked if there was any way she could assist us to fly back home. She was very helpful and  showed a genuine interest in wanting to help us. She clearly explained all the options which were available to us and explained that there would be a fee for the change of date, which we were happy to pay. She managed to check us in on the service which was leaving that night! She was very attentive to our problem and showed empathy and she was very easy to talk to.  We certainly will fly American airline on our next trip to Toronto. "
1151,"  Chicago to Philadelphia. My expectation couldn't be any lower. I've taken regular flights to US via JAL, ANA, EVA air. But this is the first time I've experienced the horror of American Airlines. I had a connecting flight from Chicago to Philadelphia. I got the ticket clearly stating my gate as H16. I waited until the specified boarding time but the gate didn't open. No staff was presented at the gate counter. No announcement was heard. By the time I realized they changed the gate(from the announcement screen which had changed the gate number before I noticed, the gate was about to close. They told me to talk to the customer assistant. I rushed to the counter. Fortunately, they have the next flight in the next 2 hours. But this mess wasn't supposed to happen. In Thailand, any airline counters would repeatedly and clearly announce any changes in flight plan or any passengers who haven't showed up yet. If any person responsible have read this, I sincerely hope you put more time and effort in notifying your customer a little more. Because our time matters, too."
1152,  Please invest a little extra money to fly any other airline. If you have an issue you already paid your money they dont give two cents. I really try not to bash any companies because they employ people. But this company sucks big time. The ground service was the only good thing about American Airline.
1153,"  Evansville to London via London. Horrible flight - 4 times changed my flight, because 1 cancelled flight, 2 flights was delayed - 1 canceled seat (they think, I couldn't reach the next flight and I could, but got no permission to go in) My Screen was broken and the staff was unpolite."
1154,"  Wichita to Dallas Ft Worth. Lost $6698.00 in flights and then had to spend another $2200.00 to get to our destination! Our flight was delayed four times which caused us to miss our 2nd flight, which was going from Dallas to Iceland (KEF). We had splurged and paid for business class to it was $6698.00 that we lost. Then we bought new tickets from American Airlines and that was another $2200.00. American Airlines will not help with any of our extra travel costs and it was their fault we had to buy more tickets. Not only was our first flight delayed four times, but the flight for the additional tickets we bought for Iceland was delayed over four hours and four separate delays. American Airlines stinks! I won't fly with them again and discourage anyone else from using their airline. I know multiple people who have had terrible experiences with American. They are always late and DFW is too big of an airport to quickly get around if your flight is delayed."
1155,  Washington to Chicago. First my flight was changed without even consenting with me. Then after getting my flights changed I sat in my first connecting flight for a half hour waiting for maintenance to repair the plane forcing me to miss my second connecting flight. Terrible lack of communication. Terrible customer service. Never ever flying with them again. And if you value your time and money I recommend you do the same and fly a different airline. I would rate 0 if I could.
1156," Vancouver to Phoenix. My flight from YVR was departing at 8:20am Sunday September 23. Upon arrival to the airport at 6am I see the big screen of departures and arrivals, with delayed 1PM next to Phoenix. I first thought well this sucks. My second thought was i have a ton of time to sit here. My third thought was why was I not notified of this delay? Fourth thought, why is the plane delayed so long? Fifth thought, would if this plane never takes off. I find myself over to the American counter, a huge line of people who also we not notified of the delay stand waiting for the attendant to hopefully find a new route for them home. People in line said their flight had been canceled over 24 hours and they had to stay in a motel and received a food voucher, other people said their plane on the way in had been delayed over 13 hours and their whole trip was ruined because they missed out on precious time. I started panicking I did not want to be stuck in Canada all day and night. I was running out of clean clothes and second I didn’t want to have to eat out another meal. I asked the attendant she said I had to wait to speak with someone as it was her second day and she had no idea why the plane had been delayed. Some customer service they have. I had a better idea to call. Once patched through to a human being and not an automated message the lady told me the estimated time was to depart at 1pm. I told her there is no guarantee it’ll take off and by the sounds of it it probably won’t because no one ever even reached out to say it was delayed. The lady said I had to wait until 1PM. I told her absolutely not. I want a refund which I think I got maybe 75% back of the ticket going back. But what a horrible way to end a trip. It is so foreign to me that as a consumer we have to notify the airlines of a cancellation within 24 hours of purchase of our ticket for a full refund. If anytime after that we don’t get a full refund. But the airlines can screw over so many people and ruin so many trips with out notice of delaying or canceling the plane. I will never ever fly American Airlines again. I only flew them this time because Southwest didn’t fly to Canada. I always fly Southwest and never have any issues with them. American Airlines are snakes and fraudulent. They will do anything to keep themselves ahead and don’t care at all about the passengers. I hope others will write about this awful experience from flying from YVR to PHX. American Airlines needs to treat their consumers better or they will tank. They have the worst cancellation policies and attendants working the counters at the airports. So incredibly unhelpful."
1157,"  Melbourne to Charlotte via Portland. I was scheduled to depart on 9/15/2018 from Melbourne Fl to Charlotte, NC then leaving from Charlotte, Nc to Portland Me. Unfortunately due to the tropical storm the flight was cancelled. I proceeded to call there 800 number as they instructed to find other arrangements. The agent sent me to Daytona Beach which is an hour and 30 mins away from Melbourne. I drove to the airport only to find out that the agent had booked me on a flight out of Dayton OH. Due to her lack of incompetence, I had driven to an airport that wasn't even flying to my destination. How do you make that mistake knowing I live in Fl and booked me a flight from OH. I called the 800 number again as Delta had a flight leaving from Daytona Beach to Atlanta and they could get me as close as Boston which my destination was Portland ME. Delta suggested that I contact AA and have them transfer my ticket to them. When I got a live agent on the phone they unfortunately could not do that for me as they were not transfering any flights for customers to other airlines. I had to end up paying for another ticket through Delta because of AA incompetents. I am thoroughly disappointed and dissatisfied with how AA handled the situation. They only refunded me for the cancelled flight I originally bought from them and would not refund me for the inconvenience they caused me nor would they give me miles for there agents mistake. They told me that they are not responsible for me making the option of flying and buying another ticket through another airline. That they can only address to higher management about the agent that made the error. I will never fly with AA again. Delta will be my number 1 choice of airline as they went out of there way to make sure that I was able to get to my destination since I was in an airport that AA had me drive to where no flights were going out of that day."
1158," Worst flight ever. A 7 hour flight for the amount of money I paid should be way more comfortable then this very full flight with no room to move your arms and legs. Everybody is jam packed on this flight. I don’t recommend flying American Airlines if you’re traveling a long distance, very uncomfortable. The plane is big for nothing, they pack everybody on and they don’t care if you're comfortable or not!"
1159,"  La Guardia to Cozumel via Miami. Where do I begin on what turned into the worst 'first class' experience I have ever had! The first flight we were meet with the least impressive first-class seat, which  belonged in a premium economy cabin somewhere. I must have missed the memo that American was now selling budget fist class. On this flight the toilet leaked blue goo all over the floor and ruined my partner's shoe when he was the first to discover this. The flight attendants were blasé and showed no empathy or compassion for the situation. Our second flight on the itinerary into Cozumel was thank goodness the one uneventful leg of the journey. Fast forward through a few days in Cozumel to our return flight 1256. You allowed us to leave Cozumel without begin able to land in DFW. Flight cancellation after cancellation lead to us being left on the tarmac in San Antonio for hours. We were then taken off the plane to clear customs and abandoned in San Antonio. No communication attempts were made except emails saying I had been rescheduled on flights, moved to a lower class of service and then those were cancelled as well. I was willing to take my chances that Houston would be a better bet given weather and we had to rent a car to get us to Houston to attempt to get home to SFO in a reasonable amount of time. I am unsure why we left Cozumel when you could not get us to the destination city. I find it irresponsible to have taken all of these passengers when the pilot told us from the get go we would need to circle around Dallas- ie we couldn’t land there. As a result of this experience, I am cancelling my upcoming reservation as the cancellation penalty could not be as painful as another flight with American Airlines. Last but not least their app is terrible and the wifi is not supported on most planes to provide entertainment"
1160,"  On our American Airlines flight from MSO to DFW, we were diverted to LBB (Lubbock, TX) due to weather. It happens, airlines cannot control the weather. It's what happens after they can control! We were in a holding pattern waiting for the weather to get better; however, it did not. The crew, obviously, notified their dispatch as when we landed in LBB they left to the hotel. There had to be communication there so American knew we were coming to LBB. After landing, the crew let us know they had ""timed out"", meaning they could not fly anymore (FAA regs.). The pilot said, ""We will probably be back around 5:00 AM tomorrow."" Good communication so far. Then we were de-planed. We were told by the flight crew to proceed to the AA counter for options. Many people stood at the counter for several hours; no one showed up. A police officer for the airport, who was extremely helpful, tried multiple times to get someone from AA to respond; to no avail. We had to leave to go to a hotel as we had been traveling with little sleep, unfortunately, we did not have our luggage. AA would not remove the bags from the airplane. Multiple phone calls were made to AA's 800 number. Not one representative cared enough to even try to assist. We were only told to take it up with the local AA counter. Here we were at another airport, no baggage, and nobody to speak with. The AA android app, which is HORRIBLE, showed a new flight for us three days later. If we were told go to a hotel, get some sleep, and return tomorrow for the flight to connect to DFW, we would have been good. Instead nothing! We ended up at the hotel at 1:30 AM, then returned to the airport at 5:00 AM, as the Captain lead us to believe the flight would leave around 5:00 AM. Well, it did not! The flight ended up leaving around 10:30 AM. We had to book another flight on Delta, which was excellent BTW, to get to our final destination. We still have not been able to speak with a representative to get a refund. Needless to say we will not fly American Airlines again."
1161,"  Terrible experience on American. Was flying from Peoria to Houston via DFW on Sept 21. Flight was late/rebooked out of Peoria due to bad weather at DFW, then couldn't land at DFW so had to refuel in Wichita and sit there a couple hours, then finally got to DFW at about 12:30a & it was about 1a by the time I had gotten to talk to a gate agent about flights home. Many customers had to sleep in the airport. All hotels were reportedly booked & American made no effort to help us find lodging. I tried several hotels and finally got to one at 2:15am. Left out of DFW the next morning, got to Houston, but my luggage was sent to the wrong airport (IAH instead of Hobby). My destination had been changed the previous day (Houston Hobby, then IAH, then Hobby again due to flight delays, cancellations, etc), but they assured me repeatedly that the bags would be delivered to the correct airport. The AA app showed I had checked 4 bags when I had only checked two. I called AA and straightened it all out but when my luggage wasn't delivered to my home I had to call again and they said they had no record of the prior call and that they might not be able to get luggage delivered to me until next day. I finally gave up and drove 20 miles to IAH myself to get the bags. Worst treatment I've ever experienced on an airline. The weather isn't their fault but dumping us off at DFW after midnight w/ no assistance to find lodging, and the incompetence without my bags, is inexcusable."
1162,  Literally a horrible experience in both directions with American Airlines from Lihue to Los Angeles. Disgusting overpriced food. Horrible customer service. Purposefully overbooked the planes and then delayed the flight to convince customers to leave a flight they paid for. I would’ve much rather flown Spirit then this poor airline. 
1163, The worst flying experience and airline I’ve ever dealt with. 20 open seats and nobody was allowed to move to an exit aisle. Over 24 hours worth of delays and cancelations and constantly lied to. I had to drive 2 hours north to Chicago for a direct flight that I found on my own and not by American Airlines. I will never ever fly with them again.
1164,"  I would never recommend American Airlines to anyone. I was originally suppose to be on a flight from Las Vegas, with a stop over in LAX with Honolulu as destination. Our flight kept getting delayed (which I understand can happen) I waited in line to speak to ladies at desk for at least 40 minutes, then only to be told to sit back down as my following flight won’t be affected. Then the flight got further delayed. So I went back in the line for at least another 45 minutes to check what I should do. I totally understand that the woman on counter was having a stressful time but honestly the customer service skills are disgusting. I have never heard people being so rude in the way they spoke to customers on that counter. When I finally got to the front of the line we were put on another flight with Hawaiian Airlines. The flight was to leave 10 hours after our original flight was meant to leave. I was reassured that our luggage would be put on that flight. After waiting around the airport for all this time and discovering that most of the food places were shut we ended up getting a taxi to take us to get some food. When we finally got on our flight and arrived in Honolulu, we then discovered our luggage wasn’t transferred onto Hawaiian airlines and was still sitting in L.A. Now I am normally a very patient person, the 10 hour wait I could handle, but the luggage not arriving after all that waiting around is what’s really annoyed me. We are actually on our honey moon and this was a short stop for a few days in Honolulu, before our return to Australia. So I would hope that American Airlines can get their sh*t together and get our bags to us today! By the way Hawaiin airlines are amazing to travel with and their staff are much more happier and willing to help, customers are their main concern. Not their coffee’s like American Airlines."
1165," On my flight from Baltimore to Dallas we were stuck on a boarder plane for about an hour because of what was explained as a Maintenance issue. That was fine I mean things do happen. When we got to Dallas I called customer service to say I wanted to switch the flight and just go home because my flight was delayed and I was annoyed at this point. I spoke with the manager on duty of customer service and they assured me that I would not have to worry about another delay the captain gave the okay to fly out. The delayed flight was suppose to leave at 9:40 then 10:30 comes around and I’m calling to switch planes and I get placed on hold for another hour and thirteen minutes, in the time I’m on hold my flight gets canceled and the customer service rep basically says they can not do anything for me because it was now technically a rain delay."
1166,"  Boston to Phoenix. Purchased first class but on return trip was re-booked for the following day in coach seats after 9 hours of delay and 2 times boarding and deplaning! The staff appeared to be uninformed by management about the true nature of the delays as the excuse given kept changing between maintenance issues and staffing problems. Nine hours in the airport with nothing more than water and chips or granola bars after the first deplaning. All the food service in the airport was closed by this time because it was late.The airline only refunded a fraction of what I have calculated to be fair (the difference between the first class seat purchased and the coach seat assigned). American booked passengers in hotels nearby but the dinner vouchers were worthless since it was 10:30 pm by the time we were re-ticketed and left the airport. I filed my first partial refund request through American Airlines website on August 21st--a month ago. The employee who initially responded has now ceased to follow up and no on else from Customer Relations has contacted me. Called the ""Refunds"" department and was told she can't help me. After I insisted on a phone number for ""Customer Relations"" she gave me a toll free number that was no longer working! Hard to believe that wasn't intentional. Why does this need to be under review so long before a determination is made? I was told it would take 2 full business days. Why do they make it impossible for customers to talk with someone? Disgusting level of customer service, if you can even call it that."
1167,"  Milwaukee to Dallas. So I booked my flight months in advance to go visit my friend in Dallas. The flight was delayed. At first by thirty mins, then an hour, then two and a half hours. They said they couldn’t find the crew, or get hold of them. Ok seems weird but I’m sure it happens. Then, they cancel it all of a sudden because of the weather. Alright, that’s reasonable. I’d rather not die. So I wasn’t really losses off at this point. I figured these things happen and my time isn’t really any more valuable than everyone else’s so whatever I’ll deal with it. So I go to the bathroom and grab a snack, figuring I’ll wait for the line to die down before talking to the booking agents. Well big mistake. All of the AA agents are gone. No trace. Vanished. It’s honestly only 7:30pm at this point, not like it’s 2am or something. So ok, no big deal, figured I’d just call. Well I’ve been on hold with no answer for over an hour now. Went online to see what I could do, they chose a new flight for me. All of the other flights have one to three layovers. Great. No now I paid a bunch of money to be in Dallas for less than 24 hours. And I tried to file to receive a refund online. surprise! That page conveniently does not work. Honestly I’m not even mad my flight got canceled because that’s just life, but clearly their customer service is terrible. So not take AA, even it’s your cheapest option."
1168,"  Phoenix to Joplin via LAX / Dallas. American Airlines is the worst airline I have ever taken. First I try to book a one way ticket to Joplin, Mo but I guess you can’t do that because the airports are small, so they had my flight going to LAX airport and me staying there for 2 an a half hours, which then went to Dallas and me stay there for an hour and a half just to then be in Joplin at 10pm when the flight from Phx was at 6am. I get to the check in place and the lady that is checking my bags tells me she going to change my flight because they is a delay that I didn’t even know of, and she can make where I go to Dallas to then Joplin. So everything is going well until we are 10 mins from Dallas airport and I guess there was a storm and the Pilot didn’t feel like he could landed there so he flies to Love Field airport where at first it was because the weather but then the fuel part broke and had us sitting on the plane for 4 hours. They finally fix it and then we get to Dallas and wait an hour again on the plane because they didn’t have our gate ready. Everyone missed there flight and the workers were very rude. Everyone had to stay all night till the next day. But they booked my flight to Kansas City, Two hours away from Joplin, Mo. So I had to buy a rental car, thank god I had my credit card because they weren’t going to give me one, and I drive two hour to Joplin. But that’s not it they tell me my bag had to go to Joplin so to pick it up there so when I got there no bag. I then had to go out and buy clothes till a lady drive my bag to me from Kansas City! This was the worst trip ever I missed spending time with my family and had to spend a bunch of money that I wasn’t supposed to spend and they did nothing to help!"
1169,  San Antonio to Stillwater. Poor customer service. They do not care about customers. This is first time I have submitted a review but have wanted to before and just haven't. I usually don't complain but tried to rebook a fly got home so I could get home to see my family earlier and they wouldn't allow me even though they had 9+ seats empty on the plane. They said I could buy  another ticket but wouldn't allow me to change flight. I'm sure they will screw up my later flight so I still won't make it home today like they have done before but certainly won't let me on earlier flight and would rather fly with empty seats.
1170," Charlotte to Anchorage via Seattle. As many people know, American had some serious software blackout issues that delayed and cancelled an untold number of flights on June 17 - the day I happened to be flying. I had saved my airline miles to take a once-in-a-lifetime trip with my two young daughters. I spent 240,000 airline miles, only to have my flights delayed (and later found out they were cancelled). We had guided tours booked in Anchorage, and delays meant cancelled trip, lost money, no memories. We had been planning this trip for the last two years, so out of desperation, I stayed on the phone with American until I was able to book a flight out of Charlotte, a two hour drive away. We threw the luggage in the car and rushed to make it in time. We eventually made our final destination, but not with our luggage - it was lost. Without going into too many details, it was late at night the following day before I got my luggage, and only because I physically went back to the airport, demanded to look in their baggage claim, then demanded to do a physical search of the Alaskan Airlines baggage area. No one could find my bag in their computer, but I found it stuffed in the back of Alaska Airlines. If I had not taken all of these extreme measures our trip would be a total loss. The flight itself was ok. No food offered without extra fees. The flight attendants only came by once. The seats were very tight and uncomfortable. When I returned I filed a complaint with American, asking for at least some of my miles to be refunded. They offered a whopping 682 miles for my trouble. 682 miles out of 240,000!! I was appalled. I literally could not believe such a slap in the face. I appealed my complaint to corporate, and received a scripted answer letting me know that they stood by their decision and reassured me it was more than fair. Of course, they wanted to make sure I knew how much they hoped I would give them a second chance. Hmm, a second chance to do what exactly? After my time, my expense, my stress, my fight to drive to a far away airport, to go back to physically search and find my luggage that wasn't even tracked in their computer (it still said it was in Seattle waiting for another flight). I can't even book a flight from Greenville to Charlotte for less than 15,000 miles per person on their own website. We had three people, but they think 682 miles refunded was fair compensation. Shame on them. We have very different opinions regarding what is fair. I have been a loyal customer of American up until now. I cannot justify loyalty to an airline that responds so poorly."
1171," The only thing the American Airlines has going for itself is its list of entertainment. May be they should be in the TV business. The only thing they do not have going is to fly passengers from one location to another. This is the second time I have missed an long international connecting flight due to unforgivable delays in take off. If you do not wish to fly your passengers then why operate an airline. I wouldn't have left this review if I had just one such incident to describe, unfortunately with American Airlines this is my 2nd time missing a connecting international flight. Will never fly this again in case of a tight schedule. However if I do not have anything to do in life and have a few extra days to spare I will consider flying American Airlines because I could waste away my time in the airport."
1172,"Not Verified |  Avoid this airline. Quality is severely lacking in everything about this airline if anything goes wrong. What’s perhaps worse than this, however, is their disinterest in you as a customer. Once you are there if they screw up in any way whatsoever i.e. their ability to deal with problems that must naturally occur in running an airline, they will simply smile, say they’re sorry and continue to do nothing to help. On top of this, if you bring any of these issues to the attention of superiors via social media they are ignored or replied to with snarky comments and then deleted. My family and I won’t ever be flying with American Airlines again and I suggest you do the same."
1173," American Airlines from Honolulu to Minneapolis via Dallas. The flight in Dallas (7:30 am) was delayed due to technical problems by 20 mins (7:50 am), which quickly escalated to change in fight and gate. Also the departure time was delayed by another 30 mins (8:25 am). Everyone was visibly tired at this point, but we still made it. The departure was again delayed by another 20 mins (8:50 am) because, “the new flight needs cleaning”. The time shows 8:45 am and no sign of boarding. When asked, the reason was that, “some of the life vests are out of the packets, they are working on fixing that, that’s why there is a delay in boarding”. The reason I am writing this review is that this is not the first time this has happened with American Airlines. A similar delay of 4.5 hours happened on the same trip (from Phoenix this time to Honolulu). The flight was scheduled at 2 pm. We boarded the flight and was asked to disembark due to technical issues. Again the flight and gate was changed and we boarded after 4.5 hours at 6:30 pm. Seriously question the quality of flights and maintenance of American Airlines flights. They are responsible for around 80 people missing the first half of their work and livelihood."
1174," I was traveling with colleagues from Boston to NE Arkansas, via O'Hare. We were supposed to have a 1.5 hour layover. Our flight from Boston to Chicago was delayed by an hour due to weather. No problem, these things happen. Usually when flights are delayed by that much the airline makes a special attempt to help travelers who need to make connections. But as we approached landing in Chicago they made no mention of connecting flights. They did not ask if anyone needed to rush off the plane to make a flight. They did not announce whether there were gate changes for connecting flights. I was at the back of the plane. Others I were traveling with were further up front. They ran ahead to the gate, which was in another wing of the terminal, a 10 minute walk, 6 minute run. I followed as soon as I got off the plane. Of course the gate was changed but no one at the old gate, when I finally got there, knew where the new gate was, so that took 3 minutes to locate it. My traveling companions who got to the correct gate first told the gate attendants that I was right behind them. But still they closed the jetway door seconds before I arrived and refused to open it. They had nothing to say, just pointed me to the customer service desk. The flights themselves were fine, comfortable, but the lack of customer focus, common courtesy, and most importantly the lack of helpful service on the delayed flight is emblematic of a company that just doesn't care. No attempt was made to help avoid the problem to begin with by asking if anyone had to rush due to the delay. No calls were made to the connecting gate to tell them that passengers were on their way. No attempt was made to help at the gate. And no apology was given at the service desk. It was a full team effort across numerous American employees to demonstrate that they couldn't care less about me as a customer. Pathetic. Also, JetBlue and Virgin both have free Wifi. American, nope. Gotta pay Gogo for really lousy bandwidth."
1175,"  Seoul to Dallas Fort Worth. Overall, a great experience with AA on a long haul flight, but some minor things could make it a little better. A few days prior to my flight, I attempted to upgrade my seat online. I work in IT so I know what I'm doing. The AA web-page kept asking me to update some details, which I did, but kept coming back and saying that they were not updated. As a result, I was unable to pay and do an upgrade. Tried this five times on different days, same result. Met a couple in Inchon who had exactly the same problem. Please fix your web-page! Despite explaining very slowly, AA staff at Inchon at check in did not upgrade me either, even though the seat was available. Fortunately, just prior to boarding, found a staff member who understood English properly, and she did my upgrade, thanks! The flight was great; fast, quiet, food and drinks were nice, and cabin crew were very polite and kind, but who on earth selected these ultra small seats?  Difficult to eat your meal without knocking your neighbor with your elbows. Please, even take out just ONE row would make the whole thing 100% better. Feel sorry for the cabin crew, impossible to get past one of them in the aisle if the food trolleys are in use. Despite all of this, I'm going to give good marks due to the newness of the aircraft, and the professionalism of the cabin crew. Captain had a great sense of humor too. Will be happy to fly AA again."
1176,  Dallas to Amsterdam. The Flight was on time but I booked a ticket with code share flight with Finnair and I can`t reserve my seats and cannot check in online so the booking process was bad. The service on the airport and in the airplane was very good.
1177,"  Chicago to Los Angeles. The seat was comfortable. The tray table was just disgusting. The cabin crew was unfriendly (Not all attendants). I bought a chicken wrap, it was okay. My IFE had a problem so it took a long time to fix it."
1178,  Phoenix to Ontario. Worst flight I’ve ever taken. Would’ve rather flown southwest like i usually do. They over booked the flight and didn’t have room for my bag so they sent it on a flight 7 hours later. Only served water and juice not even club soda or any other kind of drink. The plane was so small it was just miserable. Wouldn’t fly American airlines again.
1179,"Not Verified | Boston to Philadelphia. It was incredibly difficult to book using points on American. They seem to really want to discourage use of points. It took and hour and three phone calls to book a simple one way domestic flight. The website is convoluted and very difficult to navigate. Then I was shocked to see a $75 redemption fee. For what, a lot of aggravation? There not making enough money? It's not much of a rewards program. Bring back US Airways"
1180," I recently flew American Airlines for the first time on a trip to New York. My negative experience started right from the check in, where (with BA) I am used to dropping my bags, checking in and selecting my seat in less than 5 mins. In contrast, the check-in agents from American took 25 mins in total to override the computer to check my bags, and the same to select seats for my travel companion and myself. Obviously at LHR T3 I opted to use the Qantas, and Cathay First lounges - which are fantastic. Once onboard I started to really notice the difference in service and etiquette from other airlines. As being a top tier flyer and even when flying economy, on other OW carriers I am always greeted personally by a member of the crew, but on American I was completely ignored. Food and drink service was just average, I made the mistake in forgetting to order a special meal. I wouldn't bother trying to ask for another drink after service has finished. I politely waved at an attendant as she passed for the cabin and asked for another drink, and her response was very unenthusiastic. She returned 5 mins later and I thanked her, her response was shark ""OK"" and she disappeared. A seat mate pressed the call button as he needed water, and was scolded by one of the attendant, so for the rest of the flight I was too scared to ask for anything. In summary, the ground crew are grossly incapable and as for the onboard service. Well I think you would have a better experience on Ryanair."
1181,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Los Angeles. Got delayed 2 hours in VPS destin airport because American Airlines flight wasn’t there on time. Then we fly into Dallas and missed our direct flight to Tokyo. So we were rerouted and waited 12 hours at the Dallas airport. Finally boarded for our flight to LA then Taiwan reroute to Tokyo. So when we got on the plane from Dallas to LA, the airplanes starts smelling like burnt plastic. The power goes out and then we are asked to deplane. The the fire alarm goes off at the gate. So we deplane and are rerouted to another terminal. By this time we’ve waited all day and it’s approaching midnight. (We got into Dallas at 1230pm) not one to complain, but at this point we’re ready to bunk down. But the airline thought it was best to give us a $12 meal voucher and call it good. And customer service was short. So won’t be flying with this airline anymore."
1182,"  Dallas/Fort Worth to Detroit. They made me check my bag after I put it in the box that measures if it will fit in the overhead bin. It was snug, but fit just fine. There were people upfront and behind me with bigger bags. They all got to bring there bag on the plane. It's like she was picking on me. I don't know what I did to make her call me out. I was just going thru the line with a smile. And, she wasn't even nice about it. It was obviously personal, but I have no clue what made her want to pick on me. "
1183,"Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. Still trying to make the 48 minute flight home. This is 13 hours after our scheduled flight. DFW to Tulsa - maintenance light, pilots ran out of time, deboarded, 2 hours, reboarded, maintenance light again, deboarded, sent to seedy hotel for 1.5 hours, back at 5 am for 7am flight. New rescheduled flight: Sitting on the plane for the last 20 minutes, guess what - maintenance! They are trying to decide what to do. I am going to rent a car. Seriously. Get better systems in place."
1184,"Not Verified |  Orange County to Myrtle Beach. I had a business meeting scheduled for next week in Myrtle Beach and my company had to cancel due to the hurricane. I called American Airlines to request a refund and I was told they don't give refunds. They only give credit towards a future flight. I don't want credit as the meeting is canceled and there will be no future flight in the near future. I called my credit card company as I used my mileage to buy the tickets, and they can only refund my miles if AA refunds my ticket purchase. I'm losing both ways because American Airlines will not refund my money, and my credit card company will not refund my milage until AA refunds my ticket purchase. I wish I could give American Airlines a 0, but that is not an option. I want my money back AA, I don't want credit, I don't want your excuses. I did not receive what I paid for. I only received your excuses why you don't care about your customer. It costs you nothing to refund my money, well, maybe $1 in time.  I do not trust American Airlines."
1185,"  Atlanta to London via Chicago. I had to share my bad experience with British Airways operated by American Airlines. On Monday 27th my daughter and I supposed to fly in Chicago from Atlanta at 7:15am (flight # 1951) and from Chicago having our next flight to London at 9:15 am (flight #1541). I supposed to meet my sister at Heathrow Airport in London so we booked a hotel in London airport for the night of 27th until next morning Tuesday 28th because we had tickets to go in Paris, France. So we checked in just fine in Atlanta we went through security line… no problem we got at the gate in time, we got our seats, boarding passes and then we were waiting to go in a plane to Chicago. Right when they scan our tickets, they told us to get on the side to fix the boarding passes because the “sequence #’s are wrong! And was British Airways mistake (so either way was not our problem). Instead of taking the time to fix our problem the lady and her co-worker they were trying to fix other people problems and didn’t let us go in a plane even that we told them our next bookings and connections we have. They called the manger in charge for that day and she didn’t care to figure out what is going on. She left because she had a emergency problem not “minor problem” like ours so we were left I Atlanta airport. They finally put us on 10:00 pm direct flight from Atlanta (the only one available) So we had to spend all day in airport and miss our hotel night and almost the flight to Paris. We had a check in luggage that travel to Chicago and couldn’t be located so we had to file a claim when we got in Paris. We received the luggage on Thursday 30th so 2 days before we were leaving Paris. This really was upsetting us - we had to spend money to get some clothes to wear and personal items, so really extra unexpected expenses."
1186,"  Norfolk to Punta Cana via Philadelphia. Once in the plane and pulling away from gate the plane stopped and we sat for approx 20mins. After waiting, the Pilot announces we have a maintenance issue and they are finishing the paperwork and we will be leaving shortly. We leave after about 10 more mins and begin to taxi towards the runway. About halfway there the plane pulls over and the Pilot states “sorry folks, the plane is a little grumpy today, we have another maintenance issue and should be ready in about 20 mins. After 29 more mins the Pilot comes back on and says “ this isn’t the way we wanted to start your morning or ours, but now there is a ground stop in Philly and nothing’s moving, it should be clear in 29 or so minutes but for now we are go my back to the gate to refuel”. By this time we now are going to miss our connecting flight!!! When we arrive in PHL we are told to go to service desk and they were going to put us on a flight with another airline. We arrive at the service desk and are told that there are no more connecting flights to Punta Cana and we would have to fly to MIA and then to Santo Domingo and drive 3hrs to Punta Cana at our own expense or find a hotel at our own expense and fly out on Saturday. Really? We then ask for a manager who tells us there isn’t anything that can be done because the flight was listed as Air Traffic Issue. He then offers us a $12 food voucher for our inconvenience,  the food in the airport restaurant is over $12. So now we haves to fly to Mia then to Santo Domingo and drive to Punta , we arrived in Punta Cana at 1:30am. After a 19hr nightmare. We missed our first day at Secrets Royal Beach all Resort and couldn’t get a refund all because of American Airlines. Everyone i talked to made us feel like it was our fault and nothing could be done. "
1187,"  Shockingly poor experience on many levels, as AA had no regard for customer service. As a Oneworld Emerald am entitled to a range of benefits on AA including priority seating for myself and family. My daughter was traveling with me on this occasion, albeit on a paid ticket on separate record. AA flat out refused to link our records so my daughter could sit with me in Main Cabin Extra, necessitating me to downgrade to sit with my daughter. We were guilty of buying two paid tickets on different records and no fewer than six AA phone and airport personnel were unable to resolve and change. Instead MCE seats were given to non status customers for free at JFK check in. I am extremely loyal and fly 50+ AA, 100 Oneworld flights per year and simply cannot understand the lack of empathy or empowerment of employees in situations like this. Economy was extremely the usual uncomfortable cattle car. Deboarding devolved into a shouting match and pushing contest as several passengers rushed the door, with no AA personnel around to supervise what should be simple. Would not recommend."
1188,"Not Verified |  New York JFK to Paris. This is the worst first class experience I have ever had. The seats were uncomfortable and in flight service was mediocre at best. The electronic accommodations were minimal. I’m embarrassed that this is an American company. I will try to avoid at all costs flying with them again. they will only be the last resort. To top things off even though you’ve spent thousands of dollars to have a seat, the Wi-Fi has to be paid for if you want access."
1189,"Not Verified |  Norfolk to Albuquerque . I am so frustrated with American Airlines. As everyone knows, Hurricane Florence is approaching the East Coast. Well, I have a flight schedule to leave on September 14th, the same day Hurricane Florence is set to make landfall. When I received word that I was able to change my flight and the fee will be waived, I called AA customer service line. I explained to the CS rep that I obtained my ticket with my points and I wanted to cancel my ticket and have my miles credited back to my account. She told me that it can be done. She went to explain to me that two things can happen. The first is, I can purchase another ticket with my points but, I have to fly before September 19th. I informed her that wouldn't work because, If I was not able to travel Friday (14th Sep) there was no reason to fly because I was traveling for a specific reason. So the second thing she tells me is, I could get credit for my points after I pay them $150.00 to credit the points back to my account. I told her that was crazy. Why would I pay $150 for something that I earned for paying full price. She also told me I could forfeit my points if I choose to. This entire conversation was so crazy to me. I told her, it wasn't like I was cancelling on my own, there was a pending storm coming. All she could say was she understood. I don't think she does. I know that I am not the only one that is going through this right now, but it sure feels that way. I knew there was a reason why I didn't fly AA. This Review is for the Customer Service experience, where it all starts. My actual rating is 0/10, however I don't have that option."
1190,"  Nashville to Miami return. This was my first and last time flying with American Airlines. First off I payed $50 to check my baggage with them which is fine, no problem. When we landed back in Nashville I received my suitcase and saw a hole in the front and scratches all over my suitcase. I then went to their baggage service and she proceeds to tell me that there is nothing they can do about it that it doesn’t “cover”.  I paid you money to transport my luggage and there is nothing you can do about it? Terrible customer service and seriously will never fly with them again."
1191,"  Colorado Springs to Atlanta via Dallas. I had two delayed flights and three flight changes. I spent all day in airports and I paid extra for my tickets to receive better flight times. I certainly did not get my money's worth there. Every American representative at the airport, on the phone and via email blew me off. Worst customer service ever. I will drive before I ever use American Airlines again."
1192,"  Philadelphia to Ft Myers. Worst experience with an airline to date . They Cancel a 1040 flight at 8.15am, they then Book me on a 740pm night flight. Send me to gate B11 to find out it has been moved to gate B6 only after asking seeing the flight there is to Detroit. Don't give us the seats from the 1040 flight and charge us 24 dollars a seat extra for the isle seat they cancelled on us in the first place. Don't use this airline. Have had better experience on low fare airlines. Not a good experience will never book my personal or any of my business flights through this airline ever again."
1193," 2 plus hours in plane delay was complimented with the crew busy in trying to sell their paid snacks rather than at least asking passengers for water, while air-conditioning was probably turned off as it became hot inside. Instead of 10:49 pm arrival they taxied on both airports for hours while not bothering to give the correct reason or offering any drinks. No wonder the reviews are so low."
1194,"Not Verified |  American Airlines doesn’t care at all about its customers. No fresh food on the flight from Orlando to Washington DC. No opportunity to buy any real food on the plane for 5 hours (overall 3 hours late). They boarded us on time and then didn’t take off for another 2 hours. Landed 2 hours late and then spent 1 hour waiting for the gate. It’s clear from this experience that American Airlines truly does not care about anyone on their planes. Not the customers, flight attendants, or pilots. Everyone did their best to make it through the experience, but it was truly horrendous."
1195,Not Verified |  Our flight was scheduled to leave Philadelphia at 7:05 PM. At 6 PM we were informed that our flight had been delayed until 8:20 PM. We began boarding the plane at 7:30 PM only to sit on the plane for the next five hours. At one point we taxied away from the gate only to return back to the gate several minutes later. The whole reason for our five hour delay was that we were waiting on airplane parts for a diabled plane in Glasgow Scotland. After they loaded the airplane parts and we were ready to leave informed us that we need to top off our gas because of the fuel used and taxiing out and having to taxi back to the gate. Then we were delayed again because we had ran out of bottled water on the plane after sitting for several hours. We were on an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Glasgow for 12 hours for what should've been a 5.5 hour flight. Of course within missed our connecting flight which there is only one a day out of Glasgow to Stornoway. American Airlines just doesn't seem to be able to get their stuff together.
1196,"  Greensboro to Bangor via Philadelphia. American continues to be US Airways with a new name only. Employees are dishonest and rude. I had a first class ticket to Bangor through Philadelphia which was delayed due to weather. No problem. Agent says they have a flight next morning he can put me on. He fails to say there is no first class service and doesn't even reserve a seat. Turns out the flight has a 30 minute connection window. Furthermore, AA agent lied about refunding me for my first class ticket. When I persisted, he claimed the puddle jumper they had put me on had nothing but first class seating! Not only are they dishonest, they apparently think their customers are idiots. This is exactly the reason I switched to Delta several years ago. I made them refund my $1000 first class ticket and I bought a flight on Delta for $250. I thought I'd give American another try, but they haven't changed a bit. I'll take my $100K/year spend back to Delta!"
1197,"  Charlotte to Chicago. Horrible service. Flight was ""weather"" delayed so we were rebooked for a different flight. Was supposed to take off 10:25pm. Pushed to midnight because you don't have a backup crew at your main hub in Charlotte? Now the next announcement is 1:15am for the plane to get here? C'mon AA, get us a hotel room, meal voucher and stop wasting our time. I have been up and working since 6am. It is obvious that you don't care about your clients time. This will be a last business trip we book with you for a long time."
1198,"  Tokyo Haneda to Los Angeles. The legroom in economy was appalling and the service mediocre. I'm 198cm tall (6'6""), and usually when I fly other airlines between Japan and the U.S., I can get some extra legroom at no cost --= either by asking for a bulkhead seat or an exit row. American, however, charges extra for these options. (Seriously!? I'm supposed to pay for the privilege of assisting other passengers in the event of an emergency?!) Other (non-U.S.) airlines consider this a matter of customer service. When the ground attendants see me, they usually understand my need. Moreover, the legroom in a normal economy seat on this flight was horrendous. I actually had way more legroom in a regular economy seat on my flight a few days later with Southwest between Los Angeles and Denver. That's right -- a low-cost carrier offered considerably more legroom on a 2.5-hour flight on a Boeing 737 than American did on a 10-hour flight on a Boeing 787. On top of this, I didn't see any of the flight attendants smile during the whole flight. They weren't actively unfriendly, but they barely even acknowledged passengers with eye contact. I tried to be a model passenger and say ""please"" and ""thank you"" when ordering and receiving drinks and food, but crew members didn't even acknowledge this with a ""You're welcome"" or a smile. Also, the food was decidedly substandard. A few things were good about the flight: The tickets were cheap, the flight was on time, and the entertainment system and options were good. Also, on my return flight the staff were a bit more friendly. These are the reasons I'm rating it a 4. This is why I always try to avoid US. carriers. Fly JAL, ANA, Singapore Airlines or any non-US carrier if you can."
1199,"  Washington to Boston. It is now 10:30. My original flight from DCA to Boston was supposed to leave at 4:30. After boarding the aircraft, and waiting on the tarmac for 2.5 hours due to weather in Boston, we were told that the flight crew could no longer fly, due to time restrictions. We were told there would be a gate agent at the gate to guide us as we deplaned. There was no gate agent, and I was forced to wait in a 20 minute line only to be told that I could not be rebooked until AA cancelled the flight. An hour and a half later, I received a seat on a. 10 pm. Flight, that was delayed for 30 minutes. The boarding time was 10 pm. At 10:20 the passengers were told that there was a power problem that needed to be fixed. It is now 10:30. American, Your communication stinks, and your people do not have any proper procedures to deal with delays or cancellations. I have had it with you, and will never fly on your planes again."
1200,"Not Verified |  The worst experience ever! I booked tickets in March 2018 for a trip from Phoenix to DCA in June 2018. We were assigned seats in row 16 on the outbound flight and row 17 on the return flight. I happened to call the airline one week before the flight to ask a question about baggage fees. I was told that the seats had been changed and we were in row 33 on the outbound flight and row 32 on the return flight. The representative was of no help. I was also told that we had been assigned a new flight that was leaving and returning at a different time than the original flight. We were never told of the flight or seat changes and had I called in to ask about the baggage fees we would not have known until we checked in. After several calls I was told that I could “upgrade” my current seats to essentially the same seats I had originally booked for $300 extra. I paid the extra fees because I did not want to sit in the back of the plane. After several more phone calls I was told that they would look into giving me a credit for extra $300. They finally did give me credit for the additional $300 that I paid. That’s all they did. No apology. Nothing. This airline does not care about customer experience. In contrast, my wife and I had a Southwest flight that was just delayed two hours in leaving phoenix to San Francisco. Southwest gave us each a voucher for $100 for the inconvenience. It is hard to believe that an airline such as American does not value it’s customers. Here is the email that they sent regarding our experience… “Thank you for contacting American Airlines on behalf of XXX and XXXX XXXXXXXXX. I'm sorry the advanced seat assignments our mutual clients were given were not the seats they were scheduled to receive at the time of their departure after their flight experienced a schedule change/equipment change. I understand their frustration, as seating arrangements are important to our customers. Because there are several possibilities for why a passenger can lose their pre-requested seat assignment, such as a change in aircraft, a special needs customer, a child traveling alone etc., we cannot guarantee specific seats will be available on day of departure. While I am happy to hear that the XXXXXXXXXX received the seats they requested, albeit at an additional fee, there is no compensation due to them for their time and energy to sort their seating assignments out with a live agent. I am sorry.” I am disappointed with this airline and their customer service."
1201,"  New York to Sydney via Charlotte / Los Angeles. Unremarkable or even bad service is frankly the norm on pretty much every airline in the US, with certain well-known exceptions. To expect anything else is setting yourself up for disappointment, as reflected by the majority of reviews for this airline. Yes, I too have experienced the dreaded day-long weather delay, but I still fly American because they handled the situation as well as could be expected and they don't control the weather. I flew from New York to Sydney with layovers in Charlotte and Los Angeles. My domestic short-haul flights were unremarkable. I had a tight connection in Charlotte (40 minutes) which I made with no problem thanks to helpful ground staff. Both flights were on older 737s without seatback or BYOD IFE. On the flight from JFK to CLT this was fine, but the 5 hour flight from CLT to LAX would have been unpleasant had I not had my own stuff on hand. Legroom on both flights was more than adequate. I am 6 feet tall, somewhat overweight, and had no issues with personal space. American's hard product is easily my personal favorite of the big three, even on older aircraft. Beverage service was brusque and impersonal, as is the norm, but flight attendants were very good in a one-on-one setting. There were frequent advertisements for AA-branded credit cards on both flights, taking the form of promotional videos and several in-flight announcements from flight attendants. Some announcements alluded to cardholder benefits not actually provided by the card, so be wary of that should you find the offer enticing, but I believe this was more a misunderstanding of the product by the FAs than a willful attempt to deceive. All in all, American's domestic service is perfectly reasonable, provided you have realistic expectations of what an airline is and isn't capable of doing. American's long haul international service greatly exceeded my admittedly minimal expectations. My flight from LAX to Sydney, clocking in at a whopping 15 hours, was a brand new 787-900 with a 3-3-3 layout in economy, a definite improvement over the 3-4-3 layout found on most American long haul metal. The seat provided ample legroom and storage space. Carry-on bins were large and easily accessible. IFE was provided by a large, high definition seatback screen. The selection was enormous, but leaned much more heavily to films over TV. The in-flight map is better than most US carriers. The interface for the IFE is somewhat frustrating at first. The default layout requires frequent swiping and dragging, which the touch screen is not very good at. This can be fixed by switching to a grid based display system, which I did not discover was an option until we were close to landing. There was also a catalogue of music and books available though the system, but the selection was not very good. Dinner and breakfast were served to all passengers on this flight. Meals were surprisingly good, being flavorful and well-portioned in both instances. I enjoyed about 7 hours of rest on this flight, which is much better than the 2 or 3 I generally manage to hobble together flying to Europe. The 787 is a wonderful aircraft, and is easily my first choice when flying overseas. All in all, my round trip flight from New York to Sydney cost $1400 per person, an excellent value. I would fly American again, both domestically and internationally."
1202,"  Phoenix to Atlanta. Worst service ever! I flew with my 2 year old daughter and we both were given an aisle seat. I asked the rep if any other seats were available so I could sit with my child. She rolled her eyes. I'm guessing because I interrupted the personal conversation she was having with the other rep, I know it was personal because they each made no attempt at concealing this detail. She then asked for my boarding pass and continued her conversation with the other employee. She printed my new boarding passes and placed them on the desk in front of me. All without stopping her conversation or looking me in the eye. After the flight, I get home and my laptop will not power on. I suspected my bag was miss handled because I had broken items in the bag. I was left a ticket stating that TSA searched my checked bags. Now I have to pay $200 to get my laptop fixed. American airlines has absolutely no respect for their customers!"
1203,"Not Verified |  Gulfport to Kansas City. Very disappointed with American Airlines. Will not fly again. We are trying to leave the Gulf to get back home due to hurricane but were told we we wouldn't be allowed to move flight up a day since flights were not being canceled unless we paid 200 dollars each. (There were 2 of us.) So we did because we didn't want to risk it. Then our flight that we changed to gets canceled and we were told we could get our original flight back but not the 200 dollars each because we ""voluntarily changed it"". Yes but you ""voluntarily canceled"" our flight. Thanks for keep 400 dollars of a teacher's paycheck."
1204,"  Chicago to Knoxville. Returning home from a trip overseas is never easy, fortunately there’s American Airlines to help. Not only will they cancel your flight, they won’t give you any sort of compensation for a hotel reservation. Additionally, American Airlines won’t make any efforts to make sure you’re on the next available flight to your home town. If you like apathetic, lazy customer experience, then you’ll love American Airlines. As an American, I feel embarrassed that these clowns supposedly represent the US. Within the past few weeks I’ve flown Delta, Norwegian, as well as EasyJet. Several of these have been long, international flights over eight hours long. My American Airlines flight was domestic, and barely two hours long. Leave it to American Airlines to be the painful conclusion to your otherwise pleasant travels.  I’m going to give them one star though, as my plane didn’t crash.  American Airlines has managed to disappoint in almost every other aspect. Long story short, these fools are not reliable in anyway other than being reliably unreliable. Make the smart move and take your business elsewhere."
1205," We paid for premium flight times so we could arrive at a reasonable time on our outgoing flight to San Jose, Costa Rica and return flight via Miami. However, what we received from AA instead were red-eye flights, cancelled flights without explanation, and unanticipated expenditures associated with AA’s treatment of the 3 of us. And then AA had the audacity to offer us $100 in a voucher for a future flight on AA. By our calculations, AA made a lot more than $100 off each of us by cancelling flights that weren’t full, traveling during non-peak travel times-with AA pocketing the profits-forcing us to pay for hotels and transportation fees out-of-pocket, holding us hostage in airports with ever changing departure times, where we had no other option, but to eat airport food at premium prices, without the courtesy of respecting the sales contract by flying us out at your scheduled departure and arrival times."
1206,"  Washington to Charlotte. Unbelievable, by far the worst airline I have ever travelled with. I have been flying on low cost airlines that are much better than American Airlines. My flight was supposed to take off from Baltimore at 2pm, but was cancelled after 3 hours of waiting, because they didn't manage to fix an A/C problem in the cockpit! They put me on a flight departing 6 hours later from Washington. They wouldn't provide a refund, they wouldn't provide a lounge pass or a voucher to get something to eat, the sit they gave me was worse than the previous one and (cherry on the cake) they forced me to check in my carry-on, so I had to board holding all the valuables, batteries, computer, etc. in my hands. As it wasn't bad enough already, all the above was communicated with the rudest possible manners one could use. Thanks - I am paying for this, in case you didn't know. As always, to even see a movie on board you need to use your own device, internet is for purchase, the only food they provide is a mini package of pretzels. Dear American Airlines, I take more than 50 flights a year and I swear you'll never see me again."
1207,"  Oklahoma City to Melbourne, Florida. The flight started with a delay on the tarmac, “maintenance and paperwork” 20-30 min. On our approach to Charlotte for my layover I realized we were circling the area? The pilot eventually lets us know we’re in a holding pattern because of weather issues and that if it persist we would have to fly to another airport to refuel. We did, we had to refuel in Tri City Tennessee. By this time I’ve missed my connecting flight to Melbourne! Once we landed in Charlotte I exited the plane to find the entire airport in complete chaos! I check in at the ticket desk to find out what flight I now need to catch to finally get to my destination, Melbourne Fl. At this point the ticket agent let me know, there were no more flights to Melbourne! “Go to customer service” I did, once there the customer service agent was rude, incompetent to the point another agent had to help navigate the computer system! End result, I had a choice, stay the night in Charlotte at a hotel on my dime, “because it isn’t American Airlines fault, there was weather issues” so no they will not put you up in a hotel and catch the flight in the morning to Melbourne OR catch a flight to Orlando International. I did, I’m now out an additional $150 for a hotel and I’ve had to have my wife come and pick me up in Orlando and drive me back to Melbourne to pick up my vehicle. I will never fly American Airlines again. I started my journey Sunday 9-2-18 1:40 pm it’s now 9-3 10:18 am and I’m still at the Orlando International Airport waiting on my ride. It will be beyond a 24hr trip to get from Oklahoma to Florida via flying American Airlines!"
1208,"  San Francisco to Los Angeles. Today affirmined to me why it’s always worth it to spend just that little bit extra to fly Delta. After narrowly missing my flight I was reassigned to the next flight 7 hours later, fine, my fault. I slept at the airport and tried to make the most of it. Thankfully there was room on the morning flight since I was then a standby ticket but what I didn’t realize was my ticket had also been downgraded. Apparently there is a situation when you don’t get a carry on. I get to the front of the line, they look at my ticket, and say my new ticket is going to cost me an extra $50 for the carry on luggage. Wow. It doesn’t seem huge but delivered in the rudest of possible ways after 7 hours on an airport floor does not work for me. Delta is worth the extra $5-$20 in ticket price for sure."
1209,"  London to Miami. The ground staff was professional but not very friendly. The flight attendants were excellent one of the best I have experienced in years. Very considerate and they made the trip very comfortable. The seats were not the best of the business class category they were ok. The food quality was okay, not wow."
1210," Memphis to Savannah via Charlotte. I understand Charlotte was chaos tonight. I was meant to be home by 9pm and am still at the airport at 3am with no bag. It’s frustrating. But the staff is doing everything they can. No amount of inconvenience gives you the right to raise your voice and curse at someone who has no control over the situation. Especially someone who is as kind as this woman was and going above and beyond to try to help in what ways she can. I've watched people scream, curse, and try to bully this woman and she has remained civil and polite through it all. Impressed with the staff. Disappointed with the customers."
1211,"  St. Louis to Palm Springs. My husband is in the military so my mother-in-law and I planned a trip for months to go see him for a couple of days, and spent thousands to be able to do it. We left the house at 2am to make it to our flight on time, which ended up being delayed 5 different times due to ""mechanical issues"". Instead of just pulling in a new plane to accommodate the passengers (like Southwest does), they continued to ruin people's plans and appointments. Do not fly American Airlines!"
1212,"Not Verified |  Have heard the same variation of we can't, don’t, or won’t help you get a seat that American Airlines oversold for the last 12 hrs. Still waiting thanks the the supposed manager of special services at the CLT airport - I still don’t have a seat I paid for 6 months ago. I give negative stars if I could. In stead of helping they called the police so I would leave the counter. Way to win over customers!"
1213,"  Detroit to New Orleans. When we boarded at 6am they gave us a boarding pass with a gate number for our connecting flight, we had 20 minutes in North Carolina to get to our connecting flight to New Orleans, we ran and made it 10 minutes early to gate, lobby was full of people waiting, we thought plane was late but after waiting half hour asked someone and was told gate was changed! There wasn’t anyone there to let people know or a notice put up, nothing. We were then told that the new gate flight had already left, they changed it during the 2 hours we were in the air in our first flight. We complained and they insisted it was our own fault because they said they never print gate numbers on their tickets, when I showed them my ticket with a gate number on it that they had given me 3 hours previous they said it was still our fault for not looking at the monitors. They also said we should have known when no one was waiting, but lobby was full of people waiting. I went to speak to manager and she rebooked my party of 5 on the next flight 8 hours later so we waited and we had a non refundable tour booked in New Orleans that we were now missing. The manager said she could upgrade 4 to 1st class and would write notes to put me on stand by for 1st available stand by so I could be with my family. When we were boarding I asked about my stand by and he said there were no notes and he had no authorization so he called and she had left for day, so manager lied to us! Also we had paid extra to have seats together which now were not together and were told we would get refunded that extra, on our statement they refunded and then recharged again so in truth there was no refund! They took no responsibility and had the worst customer service. They were very rude to us after they inconvenienced us. Thank God our cruise was leaving next day because we would have missed our cruise too. Also it costed $210 for 3 pieces of luggage which is ridiculous."
1214,  Dallas Ft Worth to Mobile. Worst experience ever. Delayed several times on top of 20 gate changes. The airline resulted in cancelling my flight. I'm sure my baggage will get lost. I will never fly American Airlines if I don't have to.
1215,"Not Verified |  New York JFK to Dublin. This was the worst international flight I have ever experienced. The aircraft was not set up for international as there was no entertainment system. The flight attendants were  rude and the food was absolutely awful. At the meal service we were offered chicken or pasta, no explanation, no description. The pasta had a terrible white sauce and mushrooms (who knew). The chicken was adequate. No other services during the flight were offered. I will never fly American internationally again."
1216,"Not Verified |  I had a trouble experience with American Airlines, not for the first time. I had a flight from SFO (San Francisco) to CMH (Columbus), with a connection at DFW (Dallas). The layover between two flights was about 1 and half of hour. The first flight had about 1 and half of hour delay, and technically I couldn't make it to the next flight. However, I decided to ask AA staff to make sure about it. I asked them twice, and both times they told me ""you will definitely make it"", and ""we already made some arrangements in this regard"". When I got to DFW airport, my connecting flight was already left, and the next flight was in 12 hours (that is, the next morning). After realizing this, I decided to talk to AA Customer Service at DFW airport, and ask them for a place to spend the night. However, they told me your flight is not eligible for such an offer. So, they made me to stay at airport for 12 hours, without any accommodation. They technically treated me like a baggage. The day after this experience, I decided to contact AA to fill a complain and ask them for refund or something. However, their answer was: ""we are sorry and will try to make it better the next time"". Obviously, they really don't care, and they just want to make as much money as they can with the least quality of service or customer support!"
1217," Utterly disgusting experience. They are cheap and full of inconsiderate staff. They are not fit to be in the service industry as they lack compassion towards their customers. The supervisor at the airport did not allow me to get past the security line as my bag was 1 inch over the bag size allowed. He said ""I have to stand here all day if I have to deal with customers like you"". I had a basic economy ticket that allowed one bag under the seat and my bag fit perfectly under the seat as I have traveled on different other airlines with this bag placed under the seat. They made me pay for the bag and did not allow me to board. When called customer service for the refund of bag fee which I did not even check in, she was highly disrespectful to my request. American Airlines needs to train their employees about basic things like being polite, considerate and accommodating to customer needs and not forget that each customer has paid for the service. They displayed sheer cheapness at the airport!"
1218,"Not Verified |  Frankfurt to Washington Reagan via Philadelphia. Check-In and Security were smooth and we boarded, by bus, in groups to avoid long lines. Seats were Ok, pretty standard and IFE was also standard. Nothing special but Ok. The Seat configuration was 2-4-2 and I sat on 27A. 20 minutes into the flight they had to restart the IFE because it was overheating. After 30 minutes of waiting, it could be used again. Another technical issue I noticed was that the USB ports didn´t work, which was pretty annoying since I had a layover. However the IFE was pretty good. Especially there were so many good movies available that was incredible. Of course you had a moving map, TV Series etc. About 2h into the flight the crew served some food. As i sat on the back of the plane there was only 1 food option left, which was a Shepherd pie, it was  delicious. It came  with some salad, a bread bun and a cherry cake. The crew distributed drinks. After main course the crew dimmed the lights and we had to close our window shades. Shortly before landing the crew served either a Vanilla - or a spinach wrap with drinks. My layover in PHL was tiring but ok. At the gate there was no agent for a long time even at boarding time. So we had about 20-30 minutes delay, which was ok but I didnt´t knew the reason. As the flight from PHL-DCA is only 30 minutes long there was no service. I was  surprised about AA since I wasn't expecting that much, but I had a great flight with only a few things to complain about."
1219," Flew Boston to Washington DC. Every aspect of the flight was late. It seems every time I fly American, it’s late and there is no sense of urgency. Weather was fine, but the flight attendants’ connecting flight delayed us 45 minutes. Then the baggage crew couldn’t figure out whic carousel to use and delayed us another 30 minutes. It’s an hour flight. How tough can it be?"
1220,"  Philadelphia to Boston. American Airlines has the utmost unprofessional, unfair customer service department and it’s by far the worse I’ve ever dealt with. Their policies are outrageous as well. American Airlines canceled my flight home from Boston without warning and there was no care or concern for the predicament I was placed in. Customer service kept passing me around only to tell me the same repeated message that there was nothing they could do to assist me. This resulted in me having to pay twice for the same flight I was originally on. Absolutely awful - I am disgusted and deeply unsatisfied."
1221,"Not Verified |  Philadelphia to Miami. Very poor experience during the check-in and boarding process. Counter staff appeared disorganized which slowed down the process. At the boarding gate, passengers we're asked at the last minute to check in their carry-on bags since the overhead bins were reportedly full, but upon boarding there was plenty of space in the overhead bins. I was left saddled with a lot of extra weight during my layover due to the items that I had to remove from my carry-on because they were too fragile and valuable to leave in a checked bag. Very inconvenient. When I bought my ticket it said one carry-on bag was permitted per passenger. Why did I not get what I paid for when there was in fact lots of room in the overhead bins? American Airlines continues to take advantage of paying customers raising the cost of travel while decreasing the quality of the flight experience. Not the first time this has happened."
1222,"  Knoxville to Ontario via Dallas Fort Worth. American Airlines customer service is terrible. I received notice my flight was going to be delayed 3.5 hrs causing my connecting flight booking to be changed. The problem is I paid for round trip first class tickets 3 months ago. However Due to this delay my flight from Dallas Fort Worth to Ontario was cancelled and I was put on a different flight. Come to find out, my new flight is not in first class even though I paid for first class. So, I contacted the airline thinking it was a mistake. The first time I called I spoke with a lady who did not provide her name. She bluntly told me ""Due to the delay in Knoxville your flight was cancelled and you wont be in first class"". I told her that was unacceptable and I was mad, at that point she hung up on me. I called back, was hung up on again! I called back extremely upset by this point and got a gentlemen who  told the same thing the first lady told me and that the only way the airline would consider giving me a refund was to file a claim with the airline.  Why should I be punished after paying for services not rendered. I am 6 foot 5 inches, I always fly first class. I have flown many other Airlines and I prefer Delta, I had to fly American because this was business. But I can tell you I am never flying american again."
1223,"  Memphis to Phoenix. This airline does not know how customer service should be. I have 500k miles with them and at gold level. They still treat their business clients like dirt and the agents are rude in talking with customer. I will sell off my miles and start other airlines with thoughts ""what have done for today"" otherwise I don't use you for traveling. Beware they keep changing the program so you are never at the top level or even treated like a customer should be. I think the public need to reverse the tables on companies like this and stop doing business with them"
1224,"Not Verified |  San Diego to LaGuardia via Dallas. This airline always has problems. They overbook and then want people to give up seats and baggage because there is no room in the plane. When you are traveling from point A to point B and then C it’s not okay. They are rude and obnoxious about it and like I said before they are messy. Having to check a bag isn’t the most annoying part, what is annoying is the fact that they make you run around looking for your bag because they can’t figure out where to put them. On top of that annoyance after a long trip that was made longer by stops is the fact that bathrooms where made for 5 years olds. Even a thin person can’t stand over the toilet properly. Thanks American Airlines for treating people who don’t want your credit card and other add on’s like a herd of cattle."
1225,"  Cuzamel to Dallas. Don’t waste your cash paying for first class. On our way to Cuzamel we weren’t even offered a blanket or food and we checked in with regular flyers, which I totally don’t mind, but why did I pay extra cash if I wouldn’t be priority. Secondly on our flight back our seats were 6a and 6b and by the time they got around to us they had no more food. Totally not acceptable. Thirdly we were guaranteed a stay in premium lounge and upon landing we were told that Cuzamel is unfortunately the only country that was excluded. That took me over the edge. Totally disgusted with the service I received and I will ensure I never fly American Airlines ever again. This service sucks and I hope this company gets shut down. And last but not least the inflight movies did not work."
1226,"  In flying from Sacramento to Kansas City through Phoenix, (Date: 8/12/18) our flight was delayed by an hour and a half which forced us to miss our connecting flight in Phoenix. We immediately went to speak to an American Airlines representative, who told us that they were likely not going to be able to get us into Kansas City that evening. What they could do is get us into Phoenix, to which they could put us up in a hotel for the night, and we could fly out the next day (the 13th). Seeing this was only realistic option we had we agreed to stay in Phoenix for the night. As we waited on the flight to arrive from its delay, once we got on the plane, the flight was then again delayed, this time due to weather in Phoenix. After about 20 minutes the flight was then cancelled. We got in line to talk with another American Airlines representative to see what we would need to do for a hotel reservation to stay in Sacramento for the night, as we clearly were not getting into Phoenix. We were then told that they were not responsible for hotel accommodations due to inclement weather. Had we known that the flight to Phoenix was going to have weather trouble we would have taken the flight into Charlotte, or we could have looked at another Airline flight. I asked if I could speak to a manager and the representative told me I would need to go online to file a complaint.. The Customer Service Representative wouldn't even sit us together on our flights for the next day. We were assigned separated seats and when we asked if we could sit together, we were told that we would have to pay a premium for upgraded seats (There were multiple open seats at that time, many of which were not first class). All and all we spent about 7 hours in the airport that day We both ended up having to take an additional day of work We had to pay someone to watch our animals for an additional day We had to pay for a hotel in Sacramento We had to pay for dinner, breakfast, and lunch before we got to fly out the next day (8/13) We had to pay for transportation to the hotel from the airport And we had to pay for an additional day of parking in Kansas City On top of all of this. I have had to call and plead my case (three separate calls) to American Airlines ""Customer Service"" for over two hours on the phone. I have spoken to three different “Customer Service Reps” and 2 different managers. After a week of not hearing from American Airlines I decided to call back. This time I was told that they could not find the complaint that had been filed by Lou and that if I had a formal complaint I would need to file it with the online form (https://www.aa.com/contact/forms?topic=CR#/). This whole ordeal has cost me an insurmountable amount of time and stress at my job to take care of, almost 3 hours I have been on the phone. On top of it all, I had a device (Nintendo switch) that fell out of my laptop bag on the flight home, valued over $400, now lost. I have notified American Airlines of the lost item as well, both in Phoenix and Kansas City, to which both referred me to the online portal to submit for lost items. I will not being flying with American Airlines ever again, and I will be sure that my company, colleagues, and family are informed on how poorly this company treats their customers for when they decide to make future travel arrangements."
1227,"  New York to Dallas Ft Worth. My flight with another airline was cancelled last minute due to weather; so, I booked a one-way ticket with AA for the following day using the miles I had been saving for years and paid the $75 fee to do so. After waiting on the runway for almost 3 hours, we were told we had to return to the gate to refuel; however, once at the gate, we were finally told that the flight was cancelled and passengers were told to deplane and figure it out with the gate agent. The next flight AA could get me on was the following day at 6pm, so I waited in line for 3 more hours to obtain a travel voucher for one night stay (would you want your wife or daughter sleeping alone in LaGuardia Airport?) But to my surprise, I was told by the AA gate agent, who was seemingly extremely exhausted and overwhelmed, that AA no longer issued travel vouchers and that would have to instead submit a post-flight reimbursement claim at AA.com/customerrelations, including all receipts for hotel, food and transportation. As you can already guess, my request was denied, stating that it is not AA's 'approach to offer compensation for ATC delays', plus a bunch of other highly-pacifist lip service. My frustration and reason for this review is not due to my time being wasted on a runway for 3 hours or even for the flight being cancelled. My frustration is due to the fact that an AA employee lied directly to my face about AA no longer issuing travel vouchers (since apparently they do still offer voucher for cancelled flights) knowing damn-well I would not be reimbursed. So, on top of the miles and fee I paid to use those miles that I'd already spent thousands of dollars on to obtain, I'm out an additional $470 bc their employee lied to me. Had I known this, I would have demanded a voucher or a solution for where to sleep. "
1228," I was forced to use American Airlines to save $300 on a round-trip ticket from other airlines, so it was cheaper but the employees were all rude with a poor attitude from the very beginning. American Airlines is by far the worst airline I’ve ever flown and I fly at least five times a year for the last 18 years. Their customer service is complete garbage and they treat you like an animal. If they spoke to me out in the street or on the sidewalk like that they wouldn’t walk away with their front teeth intact, but since they work for an airline I have to be polite. Without working for a highly secured airport situation they wouldn’t talk to people the way they do or treat them that way. Will never fly AA again if I can help it. Stick with Southwest, JetBlue, any of the more people oriented and polite fun airlines."
1229,"  Dallas to Denver. Since moving to Denver over a year ago I have had to travel more than 10 times. Given that American Airlines has a hub in Dallas it offers the most options for flights each day, so until now I have chosen to fly with them. However, as I sit on yet another delayed flight I have decided that this will be my last trip with American. In the 20 legs between Dallas and Denver I have flown with American I have been delayed on 14 of them. Most of these delays were not weather related. American Airlines is by far the worst carrier I have encountered (and that compared to lousy overall industry performance). "
1230,"  Boston to Bozeman. My wife and I booked a flight from Boston to Montana, and on the flight down we had missed our connecting flight due to the pilot leaving ten minutes early. No big deal, things happen, we understand that. One the flight back, it was delayed repeatedly, being pushed back from 8 pm to 1 am, and then finally canceled. Come to find out the next flight isn't until the following day at 5:30 pm. I spoke to a rep trying to get on an earlier flight, and while he was helpful he was unable to provide any other alternatives. I requested to speak to a supervisor who might be able to pull some strings. Now, up until this point, I was respectful, and while aggravated, attempted as much as possible not to project that aggravation, as I know he was doing his best. I have worked in a call center before, and I know how aggravating it can be to be someones personal punching bag. However, once on the line with this agent, my complaint changed from one of unfortunate circumstance to one of complete disbelief that American Airlines can be so callous towards customers. The supervisor was condescending, patronizing, and insulting from the very opening of the call. She pronounced my name with blatant disgust and ensured to pronounce hers with an air of authority that indicated I should feel graced by the fact that she took a few minutes out of her important schedule to speak to me. She belittled my concerns, refused to offer any recourse whatsoever, or apologies for inconveniences, and basically openly insulted me when I implied that the airline with the flight I was trying to get on was American Airlines, as opposed to being an opposing airlines flight. When I called her out on this by asking her if she found it acceptable to speak to me with a condescending and patronizing tone of voice was to talk over me, loudly telling me that she was not doing that, and then to proceed to disconnect my phone call in the middle of my sentence. I called back, and requested to speak to a supervisor in regards to my experience with a customer service rep. She patched me through to a representative in the same position, that informed me that she doesn't know who she is, and I can't file a complaint through her or speak to anyone who can record a complaint against her, as they are an email only department. After about 15 minutes of going around in circles with her, I wrote out a detailed email to the department I was told to reach out to, and received a cookie cutter type response offering insincere apologies and offering no recourse whatsoever. The agent and my experience with American Airlines has left me in complete disbelief that a company can operate with such indecent practices, and offer no remorse whatsoever or even a token apology to make the situation a little more bearable. I understand that some things, especially weather, are out of a companies control, but the callous disregard they have for the inconvenience that their customers are put through as well as the disrespectful way that their customer service handles the situation are completely unacceptable. There is a lot more to the story that I am unable to add due to the character limit, but I hope that my poor experience will serve to warn people away from this horrible company."
1231," Santa Fe to West Palm Beach via Dallas. Missed connecting flights both westbound and eastbound due to American Airlines mechanical and crew problems. Had to spend a night at airport in one direction, and five hours waiting for another connecting flight in the other direction. The line at American Airlines ""customer service"" was more than 250 people long at the Dallas airport and the airline refused to compensate for their own horrible service. American passenger assistance sets the customer service bar so low that all the others shine. My experience with American Airlines demonstrates why it is better to stay at home than to travel."
1232,  Dallas to Medford via Phoenix. Was grounded in Dallas with mechanical issues for 4 hours until we finally got re routed to Seattle instead of going to Phoenix. Get to Phoenix and was told our flight into Medford Oregon was canceled that morning! Wanted us to spend night in airport until 9 am Friday and told no other flights. Finally got on Alaskan flight and had no issues. Come back Sunday make it to Phoenix to board plane and have mechanical issues and get late start and miss connection flight in Dallas. Ridiculous.
1233,"  I paid for a normal flight to Memphis from Pittsburg which has a layover in Philadelphia. This flight allows you to bring one bag that fits under your seat as long as it’s the appropriate size which I think is 18”x14”x8” which my bag was 14”x14”x8”. They wouldn’t allow overhead access which is a new rule but it can go under your seat. I applied by this rule. As I’m boarding the plane they told me I had to check my bag and couldn’t board with it. This is absolutely bogus. I had to complain to them to let me bring my bag on. They told me there wasn’t anymore overhead bin room. Great, I get that, but mine fits under the seat as I premeasured my bag. They said they didn’t care, they didn’t have overhead bin access so I had to check my bag. I told them I understand that there isn’t but mine fits under my seat. They then tried to say that it didn’t matter because I had two bags, the second being my purse... since when do purses count? But that could also fit in my bag so i put my purse in my bag. They eventually let me take my bag (which comfortably fit under my seat) but I had to complain to them more than enough times. They made multiple people check their bags for no reason."
1234,Not Verified |  Orange County to Washington Dulles. Our flight was redirected to Austin due to storms in Dallas. I get it. Refueled and flew to Dallas after 1.5 hours in Austin. Connecting flight rescheduled 4 times then finally canceled. Have been sitting on the ground now in Dallas for 2 hours “waiting for a gate” - Dallas is an AA hub. Ground logistics here are grossly mismanaged and an absolute disgrace.
1235,  Dallas to Las Vegas. Horrible customer service. They cancelled our flight and offered us no compensation whatsoever. No meal no hotel stay not even a discounted room rate or flight discount. If you would like to be told to wait in an airport for 14 hours this airline is for you.
1236,"  Dallas to Duluth via Minneapolis. There was an issue with a plane leaving from Dallas to Chicago and the delay was going to make me miss my connection which was also the last of the two flights that go into the city. I understand that it’s they deal with a lot of angry people but this time I really needed to make my flight for a work obligation. I received little to no help at the desk & was told to call the 800 number. I am so glad I did! I spoke with Deborah (we had the same name) she went above and beyond any flight line agent I’ve ever had (and I fly frequently) I am beyond impressed! She did not have to try to help me as much as she did and calm me in a stressful situation (on the verge of an anxiety attack to calmly writing this review on the plane). She stayed on the phone working a ton of logistics for almost an hour, she stayed on the phone until I was able to confirm I was good to go for my next two flights! She was so kind and helpful. Very appreciative -  even in a delayed flight and other less friendly reps. I still give the highest rating because she made up for it all with! Thank you so much!"
1237,"  Washington to Cincinnati. I fly regularly for business reasons, and among all the airlines, American has consistently had the worst cancellation problems and the worst infrastructure for dealing with them. No hotel--not effort to get creative in rescheduling (through connecting)--long delays in customer service that prevent the fixes I independently create. Just fly Delta."
1238,"Not Verified |  Reno to Dallas. Do not fly American Airlines. As a young first time traveler I was unaware of how poor customer service would be. We came from Reno trying to get home to Hartford which requires a connecting fight in Dallas Fort Worth. My younger sister and I got to our first gate no problem where they spent 20 minutes begging people to check luggage causing the line to back up. The plane took off late. We thought it wasn’t a huge deal because we had time between flights. Both flights were booked through American which I thought would make them a little more aware of delays with other planes. Myself and 6 other very kind people missed our connecting flight to Hartford all on the same plane. We landed and sat on the ground for 25-30 minutes “waiting for a gate and crew.” They closed our flight because we got off the plane too late by no fault of our own. They then sent us to customer service where we waited in line for about 40 minutes for them to tell us the only other flight to Hartford was at 7:30 am the next morning where we again would have to get on a connecting flight in Chicago. The people were terribly rude at the desk where they then told us it wasn’t their fault and we would have to cover all our room costs to stay the night in Dallas. Flights are not cheap making this service completely inexcusable. It would be a whole different thing if this was an inexpensive product. My sister and I ended up pooling all our traveling money together to spend $90 to stay in a room over night. I wish I could give them zero stars. To be fair our flight there was not something to complain about, but they have lost my business forever. Not to mention all the other people on my same flight who missed their connecting flights.  With this first hand experience I would never recommend American Airlines to anyone who would prefer to not be treated like a piece of luggage themselves. If you want disrespectful, unhelpful, ridiculously rude customer service this is the airline for you."
1239,"  Kansas to Barcelona via Chicago. I had been traveling since June 10th when my plane left from Kansas City at 7:00 pm. The plan was to fly to Chicago and then catch a 9:15pm international flight to Barcelona. Then by 9:30 pm June 11th I would be in Amman, Jordan. However, things did not go as planned when my Kansas flight got diverted from Chicago to Madison, Wisconsin due to a storm. Since then, it has been nothing but a nightmare and dissatisfaction with American airlines. In Madison, I waited in line for over three hours along with other passengers to make travel arrangements and hotel reservations. I was the last person to leave the airport, around 2:30am on June 11. The AA staff then assured me that he made my reservations and had rebooked all of my flights through the rest of my international, arrangement. He printed me the boarding pass to Chicago and also to Paris. He informed me to come back in the morning to check-in my bag and sent me off to a hotel. Well, I was back by 9:30am at the airport to start my journey. I checked in and got my boarding passes to Chicago and to Paris. However, the staff informed me that since they made my connections through Delta, they wouldn’t be able to print the boarding pass from Paris to Jordan and that I would have to do that in Paris when I landed. However, they assured me that all is good and that my bag, has a label to AMM; it will continue to Amman. I took their word and got on a plane to Chicago; landed there and continued to my Paris flight. Seven hours later I landed in Terminal 2A in Paris at 10:05 am, June 12th. My supposed flight to Jordan was going to leave around 3pm. So, I ran to get to terminal 2E. I did get there, but I needed a boarding pass to cross through security. First, I tried the kiosks, but was not successful. I talked to an Air France person who informed me there was something wrong with my booking and that I needed to speak with Air France customer service. Luckily, it was just a few feet away; however, the line was 100 feet long. So, I waited in line for 90 minutes. When I got to the customer service representative, they informed me that my reservation was not done correctly by AA and it was cancelled. They told me that the plane to Jordan was full. The representative also said that I would need to talk to American Airlines to fix their mistake and rebook me on another flight. This meant, I had to run back to terminal 2A. I did run to Terminal 2A to find AA counters closed for the day as their last flight was leaving. Luckily, there was somebody trying to get to the locked office who agreed to try to help. Now it was past 1pm, 3 hours after I arrived and I didn’t know if I would ever leave the airport and join my family who travelled one day before me on Sat. Thinking I will be joining them just a day later. It is now 2 days later and God knows where my bag is now. After about 40 minutes, the AA staff told me that he booked me on two Turkish lines arriving in Amman by 11:55pm. I waited for 4 days in Amman for my bag!"
1240,"  Charlotte to Palm Beach. This airline has often changed our flight times and seats. What is the point of setting up days off and meetings if the airline cannot stick to the schedule they came up with? What is the point of paying extra for a specific seat if they are going to change your seat? What is the point of only having Wi Fi entertainment if the plane has no electric plugs to keep your device powered for 7 hours? I fly several times per year from Florida to the mid west and west coast. On this particular flight the flight attendant passed my row for snacks and drinks. Flight was delayed for departure and I was hungry. I asked her for a snack when she two rows back, rather then walk back two rows she said she would come back. After landing I asked her why she did not come back and why she passed my row - she said that she got busy and tried to get my attention 5 times. I asked my wife and friend sitting next to me if she tried to get my attention and they said no. "
1241,"  Gate crew was horrible! I flew in from Abeline, TX and connected in Dallas before heading home. My flight in Abeline required a gate valet for my carry on because the plane is super small - 3 seats across and I can’t stand up straight in the cabin. No problem, as they met us at the arriving gate with our bags. Having not removed the valet tag, the gate crew in Dallas wouldn’t let me take it on the plane, even after showing it clearly fit in their sizing frame, and after watching countless other passengers board with even larger bags. I have flown with this carry on bag countless times with no issues, including flights on American. Rather than seeing that the bag fit, they forced me to check it anyways because heaven forbid they be proven wrong. Screw American Air and their horrible, horrible service."
1242,"  Charleston to Charlotte Amalie. Bought nonrefundable tickets for our trip to Saint Thomas. Purchased the 3rd party flight insurance. Resort informed us that they were unable to accommodate us due to Hurricane. Submitted claim to insurance and they declined the reimbursement. The resort being uninhabitable should have fallen under their coverage but they declined. They even told me to cancel my tickets before I could submit the claim. Even if we found a new accommodation, we couldn't as the resort was a gift, we would have to shell out another $1300. Shady business."
1243,"  Orlando to Dublin via Philadelphia. Having read many Bad reviews from customers having flown American airlines , I wasn’t looking forward to a 10 hour Dublin to Orlando flight with a return leg to look forward to 12 days later. We were two adults and 5 children between 10 and 15 years old. From check in staff In Dublin, to the flight crew, everything was above average. Many reviews complained about the seats, how uncomfortable they are and their pitch. This seems to be a problem with Boeing as the 4 Airbus planes we flew were comfortable and more than adequate. One issue we had which did leave a bad taste with all of us was the check In attendant in Orlando. We each had 23kg baggage allowance. On average we only had 10 kg each. We asked to check in one of the children’s cabin baggage and were instructed that this would cost a further $100 as 7 albeit light bags had been checked in. We had to retrieve one of the bags to add her toiletries, as they would have been confiscated, necessitating 45 minutes of waiting for the bag to come back. The check in assistant was adimant and very cold in her customer service. It was an unfortunate experience but the other staff were very good."
1244,"  Philadelphia to Dallas Ft Worth. My original flight was from Philly (departure time 6:05am) to (O'Hare departure 8:10am) then to DFW (arrival at 10:36am). First, I got held up in Philadelphia for almost 3 hours because of the weather. Which, it wasn't even raining out yet but they weren't sure about the weather. Ok. Which in return missed my flight from O'Hare to DFW. I arrived in O'Hare 10:45am. I got another flight departure 1:00pm. Ok. Its 12:30, now the flight is delayed till 1:37. Ok. Its 1:15, flight is now delayed till 4:05! So again, it's 2:30 now my flight gets cancelled. Now there's no flights to DFW until tomorrow morning!! Not going to work for me.  So now I have to fly to Raleigh-Durham, NC. To DFW arrival time 9:05.  Worst airline imaginable! I will never fly American airlines again nor recommend it to anyone. Awful customer service skills also."
1245,"  Puerto Vallarta to Columbus via Dallas. Never again, a total joke. Had literally everyone running back and forth all over Dallas Ft Worth airport. Delayed, delayed, delayed,  only thing delayed was their care for customers. Literally everyone in airport dealing with these jokers was seriously aggravated. Let us get all the way through to the gate to discover the plane already left. We will no longer be using your services."
1246,"  I am very dissapointed in this airline. They have essentially robbed me and my family. We were scheduled to fly in December 12, 2017 to Puerto Rico and had been saving up to go all out with First Class tickets which is an extreme luxury for us. Due to the devestation of Hurricane Maria we cancelled our flight and were told we had a year to reuse our tickets. I tried to make my new reservation on Aug. 10, 2018 and was declined to use my credit because the credit was only valid until year from the date of purchase which was Aug. 7, 2017 and not from the ticketed departure date of Dec. 12, 2017. That is right, I was 3 days late. Needless to say I was very upset and made a formal request begging for a 3 day extension in order to uae my almost $2,100 credit and this is the message I just received 3 days after my request. I'm sorry that you didn't travel with us as planned nor were you able to use the value of your unused tickets within a year. We know that travel doesn't always happen as planned, which is why we give our customers one year from the date the original ticket was issued to begin new travel. We believe that offering a full year to rebook travel provides our customers the flexibility they need to use their flight credit. I'm sorry for any disappointment we might cause by declining your request. Let me assure you that our position does not lessen our regard for you as our customer. It is always our pleasure to serve you, and I hope that we have the opportunity to welcome you aboard again soon. This is the same as stealing!!! I did not lose $300 or $500 it was almost $2,100 of my hard earned money saved up to to have a dream vacation and due to circumstances out of my control (mother nature) I had to cancel my original vacation and was excited to plan it again for this year only to find out I was 3 days too late! I never expected the airline to act so callously and lack such compassion for their clients after a lifetime of supporting them. The airline has significantly destroyed the image and reputation it had with my entire family."
1247,  San Francisco to Ithaca via Philadelphia. Awful from start to finish. Cramped over stuffed planes and the whole experience screamed “how can we make the most money regardless of customer quality?”. My flight was canceled in PHL. They will not reach out to you for a refund so I called customer service and spoke to the rudest woman who was about to explode with anger at any moment. As if it was my fault. She was rageful and just terrible at making me feel like a valued customer. Who knows if I’ll actually get the refund for my cancelled flight (since it’s such an inconvenience to AA airlines). Never ever again. Just the worst.
1248,"  Chicago to Denver. My family and I are trying to get home to Colorado. Me, my brother and my sister and our friend have been put on standby four times, the people at this airline are not much help, they have bad attitudes, are lazy, and they didn’t even bother to ask other people to give up their seats or to check the airplane to see if it was full. I am very mad at this airline and right now you have four very unhappy customers. This airline is not worth flying with and i will rate this 1 out of 5 stars."
1249,"  Grand Junction to Houston. Flight from CO to Dallas at 10:35 delayed to 11:15 so we also missed our layover to Houston. Rescheduled to 11:16 from CO to Dallas. So we get on the plane, sit on it for an hour, now we have evacuated the plane due to a mechanical issue. On top of this, it causes us to miss our rescheduled layover which was the last flight to hobby. So the said they can fly us to IAH at 5:45 (which isn't even the airport we were to fly into). American Airlines has the worst customer service I’ve ever seen. I will never fly this airline again."
1250," Ft Lauderdale to Fayetteville via Dallas. Terrible customer service. Have to sleep at airport due to mechanical problems, after they forced me to book (and pay for) my only bag. To complain, I have a choice of standing in line with approximately 100 other people waiting to do the same, or call them (quoted hold time 60 minutes - no kidding). I cannot express enough how much I have come to hate this airline over the years. Just when you think they cannot make you dislike them any more - they find new ways to underdeliver without the smile. While rolling eyes. They have classes on weekends on how to sigh, be useless and insulting at the same time while accomplishing nothing. Oh! And the gate changes. Do not forget the last minute never ending gate changes. Then suddenly the person that was just your gate agent 30 seconds ago, where you have been dutifully and patiently standing, will weasel their way out of helping you. Like a game of gate-agent-wack-a-mole. Hate is a gentle word."
1251,"  Norfolk to Montreal via Philadelphia. My flight for 8 AM from Norfolk to Montreal was cancelled due to the crew not being available, it was chaotic at the airport. I waited two whole hours in line with Zero customer care or attention. Finally I was told that the only flight would take me to Montreal is in the afternoon and then I would arrive at 11;30 PM. I did not trust the agent and I talked to another agent who re-booked me via PHL at 10:50 AM and departure being at 8:50 PM from PHL meaning my arrival to Montreal would be almost Midnight. While waiting at the airport I called the customer person and she was kind enough to book me at 6:00 pm (so I gained 2 hours by talking to this person.) Then when I arrived to PHL I walked to customer service department and they put me on flight at 3:00 PM. This is the worst airline and the customer support out for Norfolk was disgusting for them to send passengers home saying there was no flight available, it was not true. IF I was able to get on a flight to Montreal later in the afternoon why was this entire booking not done earlier. The airline has the responsibility to train their agents at the ticket counter and to also train them for being compassionate and understanding and to try their hardest to get people home. on a scale of 1 to 10 (being high ), I will give American airline and its agents zero. Horrible experience and it was unnecessarily delayed. "
1252," Bradley to Hilton Head via Charlotte. This is the worst flight company I have ever used. Our initial flight was delayed by 3.5 hours. My second flight is, as expected, delayed. My trip time has been doubled. I will never use this airline again and do NOT recommend. I should have drove."
1253,"  Orlando to Charlotte. First off, our plane got canceled the night before while other airlines just delayed until later into the night. Then, we got charged twice for baggage and the employees were rude. Lady said we had to wait until our whole family was with us. When we were together I got in line and she said I had to wait until she let me in line and I said i was here the whole time and my family is here and she kicked my bag out of the way and put someone in front of me. Then we were told to go to another line to get refunded our baggage and when we got there, they told us to call a number. Ridiculous how you can’t get in person customer service and everything is by phone number."
1254,"  New York to St Louis. American Airlines is one of the worst airlines I have traveled. Every time they charged Carry on fee of $50.00 at the gate, cancelling flights and called the reason beyond their control. Our flight taxied on runway for 20 minutes before taking off and they cancelled the flight, because plane didn't have enough fuel for the journey. Is this a good reason? We had to stay overnight in NY at our own expense and spend more the $300.00 not including the taxi fare to and from the Hotel. This is not the first time it has happened in our previous trip also. They overbook the flight and then bump-off people because of some silly reason. "
1255,  Tampa to El Salvador via Miami. American Airlines has the worst service. They cancelled my trip 3 times. They overbooked the next available flight so they asked us all to check in our carry ons. They didn't care about me needing my suitcases to retrieve my medication. They told me they were just not giving it because it would cause too much trouble.
1256,"Not Verified |  Mexico City to Charlotte . This was my first time traveling with American Airlines and to be honest, I was very disappointed. My flight duration was approximately 3 hr 30 min to 4 hours. And what did they serve us to eat? Two cookies and a bag of pretzels. No TV & terrible wifi. I’ve always flown on Delta and it is much better. Don’t think l’ll be flying AA anytime soon."
1257,"Not Verified |  Jacksonville to Phoenix via Dallas Fort Worth. This was the worst flight experience I ever had. Our flight was delayed an hour and a half to Dallas and made us miss our connector. They put us up in a hotel to get us to Phoenix the next morning, but that flight was delayed an hour as well. They also changed the gate on us to a completely different terminal. We had to sit on the plane for half an hour before departing while technical difficulties were fixed. This interfered with our scheduled plans with friends, and we almost missed a wedding in Payson, AZ. We had to cancel our hotel and car reservations and make new ones, and if you are basic economy you don’t even get a snack. I will never be flying American again."
1258,  Baltimore to Tallahassee via Miami. Flight from BWI was for scheduled for 4:55 got delayed until 9. We didn't get to Miami until 1am. When here the airline gave us a hotel and said it was only 15 min away. We get to the shuttle and ask if they go to the hotel American gave us. And he laughed and said it was 35 min away. So we tried to find a shuttle that could take us but the next one came 1 and a half hours later. So we had to sleep in Miami Airport. Which is the biggest garbage can of a airport that I've been to we got here and trash was laying everywhere. Next our flight from Miami to Tallahassee was scheduled for 10:30 but got canceled. So we're waiting again. And fingers crossed the flight will come at 2 but seeing how frequently flights get delayed and canceled I'm extremely doubtful about taking off at 2.
1259,"  Dallas to New Orleans. I fly 2 to 3 times a month. American Airlines is one of the worst airlines to take. If you want bad service, delayed flights and more gate switching at the last second then take this airline. I avoid their airline like the plague. You would think being around as long as they have they would figure it out. Last leg with them was delayed by an hour because they didn’t have enough flight attendants. Really! Get your act together or sellout to an entity that knows what they are doing and by no means do you deserve a main hub at Dallas. You deserve one in Siberia."
1260,  The worst experience I have had while traveling. Especially the customer service at FFW gate d22 in 8/9/18 at 1130 pm. One representative said my delay was crew related and a second one came up to cover it up and wait it was weather related. Other airlines are flying out and in to DFW now. There is not a weather problem there is a crew problem and the airline is lying to the customers. 
1261,"  New York JFK to Orlando via Charlotte. My experience was by no means good but not bad. The flight to Charlotte left at a ridiculous time of 5am, Tsa screening didn’t open until 4 am (we arrived at 2am). Even worse the ground crew had terrible attitude problems, there was one agent who arrived, checked in 1 passenger then went home. But apart from that, the flight attendants were lovely people who knew great service. The ground crew in Charlotte seemed to be quite pleasant as well."
1262,"  Houston to Providence via Charlotte. Almost every flight flown with American this year has been an absolute nightmare. Broken food and drink trucks, no AC, delays, delays, delays.... oh and lying about cause - multiple answers just adds to the stress and issues! I rely on my airline to get me where I’m going to keep my job and support my customers - they do not care and are not helpful. Don’t even get me started on not being able to select a decent seat - everything has a charge - but why would I pay extra for less - which is always the case"
1263,"  I booked a trip via American Airlines on July 7th to travel from Gainesville, FL to Boston, MA on Friday, August 3rd. I checked in the day before the flight and woke up at 4am so I could be ready for the 6:27am departure time. I was to go from Gainesville to Miami, FL. I was supposed to depart Miami, FL at 8:34am and arrive in Boston at 11:51am, where my ride would be waiting. I was notified at 5:18am that my flight had been delayed and we would depart at 7:30am, thereby making me miss my connecting flight in Miami. There was no reason given for delay. Then I was notified at 6:22am that the flight was cancelled. No reason given. I was to be rebooked on a flight that would arrive in Boston at 12:47am the following morning. I let the desk agent at Gainesville know this would not work for me. They rebooked my flight from the Orlando airport to Charlotte, NC and the soonest they could get me in would be 5:11pm to Boston. They sent me on a shuttle to the Orlando airport where we were delayed yet again taking off. We were delayed 30 minutes in Charlotte, then sat on the tarmac for 2 hours. It was awful. I ended up arriving into Boston at 8pm. I was tired, upset and had missed my ride. When I tried to get reimbursed for my time and the inconvenience, American Airlines Customer Solutions offered 7500 bonus miles, which is embarrassingly meager and anyway, I wouldn’t fly with them again if they were the last airline available. I was never told why there were so many delays or why my flight was cancelled on August 3rd. American Airlines has awful customer service, lacks the desire to communicate and does not value customer satisfaction. As far as I’m concerned, they took my money and caused me unnecessary stress."
1264,"  Charlotte to Miami. Sat on tarmac for 45 minutes pilot said ""Miami is open 24 hours so we are going to take our time."" Flight before this one (the flight I'm reviewing was a connecting flight) was also delayed. Flight attendants kept bumping into my seat as they would pass by. $25 checked bag fee which is really stupid considering their competitors offer 1 if not sometimes two free checked bags. "
1265,"  Paris CDG to New York. A bit of an ""airline-geek"" I used a convenient website to discover that our B767 was 23.7 years old. Traveling International Business, I was hoping that the plane would be retrofitted with modern amenities. Firstly, the Admirals Club at CDG is magnificent - food...liquor, work-space, relaxing areas; this club puts USA clubs to shame! The plane looked old; the bathrooms were atrocious but functioning but, the seats were fantastic. IFE via Samsung tablet was sufficient. First thing I noticed was the myriad of uniforms and attitudes from the 8 flight attendants. Safety is paramount but, service is what can make or break the passenger's perspective. Each FA wore a different uniform, except for the younger staff, who represented the airline with proper etiquette. Tie, no tie, blue shirt, white shirt, grey jersey dress, etc., it was was mix-match that sent an unprofessional message. Sadly the warmth and service suffered from the same issue. The FA in Business Class functioned. There was no extra sense that I was flying in a ""Flagship"" experience. Nothing was offered other than the typical drink, dinner and snack. No walk-through the cabins to offer additional aperitifs or any other needs or niceties. The much boasted wine-pairing was not even mentioned. The main starters were poor; not every one likes cold salmon and celery/radish salad. Main plate was OK, certainly not what I have experienced on other carriers including Delta and Cathay Pacific! Asking for dessert to be offered a little later after lunch, the FA serving the 14 of us conveniently forgot. I did however get a cold cup of coffee after troubling the FA - and that's what I felt, like I was a trouble. I understand that working with the public can be aggravating and perhaps working conditions within the employee union may effect attitude but, the service and food quality was extremely poor. The most gracious staff member on the flight was the Captain who was so appreciative that we chose AA! We arrived safely but the seven hours in air was mediocre and truly representative of a 3 star airline. Hey American why not try for a 4 or 5 star rating. But, that might take a lot of hard work, an attitude change and perhaps a uniform that all can wear and be proud of."
1266,  Charlotte to Chattanooga. My flight was cancelled both ways. We missed a connecting flight in Charlotte even though we arrived 10 minutes before take off. Airline staff would not let us board because they already gave our seats away. Paid for seat upgrade and ended up sitting in back of the plane and not sitting with my family. I spoke to several staff and no one seemed to care. Horrible!
1267,  Philadelphia to Los Angeles. We were boarded on the plane and sat on the plane for an hour and a half before take off because the line was so backed up and this was only for American airline flights as we were leaving there were still 11 planes behind us. After a flight across the US we come to baggage claim to find out more than half of the bags on that flight were placed on another plane that will arrive 2 hours later. I'm writing this review as I'm sitting on the floor of the airport with this extra time. Thanks American airlines for three hours I'll never get back.
1268,Not Verified |  I got home 24 hrs later than scheduled and I was darn lucky to get home and lucky that they put me up in a hotel overnight. Many other passengers had spent the night on the floor in Charlotte North Carolina. Two of my flights to get home we’re canceled then the next day I had a ticket with a seat when I went to board many hours later was told they didn’t have a seat only through the intervention of wonderful employees did I even manage to keep my sanity and they did find me a seat on the plane as it was on the ticket -  however no explanation was given for all of the canceled flights. Up until the last second I wasn’t sure I could board. I’m afraid to take this airline again as they may not get me to my destination and I can’t be sure that I’ll get home as scheduled. I’ve had much better service from American Airlines in the past I don’t know what’s going on with this carrier.
1269,"Not Verified |  London to Norfolk via New York. Flight canceled on way to UK (maintenance), flight canceled on return (JFK to ORF). Previously 6 out of my last 10 flights have been canceled and significant delays. They are just shameless and I am now shifting to United Airlines. I don’t think fare paying passengers will be treated with some respect and any level of customer care until the regulatory authorities/Government take action to implement a code of conduct that protects the passengers."
1270,"  Dallas to Los Angeles. Late again! Pilot emphasized 3 x during flight how we would arrive 4 minutes ahead of schedule. Once at LAX, sat on plane over 45 minutes making us over 25 minutes late. Pilot had no explanation except that AA plane at our gate couldn’t move due to minor mechanical problem and paperwork. Couldn’t find another gate at LAX. Same old AA incompetence."
1271,"  
Puerto Rico to Miami. Horrible experience today flying with AA. First, I wake up to two voicemails explaining that my flight was delayed and that I may have to stay the night at my layover destination. So I call the number they left me to try and reserve one for same day. I get one same day but that flight was delayed by 3 hrs. Had to reschedule my connecting flight and now my connecting flight is delayed as well. I’m sitting in the airport waiting on my connecting flight as I type this. If AA does nothing for me about this, I will not fly AA again."
1272,"  This flight segment was the absolute worst flight have had the displeasure of in my 54 years. Apparently, there was poor weather in the area/in route to Charlotte, NC where I was supposed to catch a connecting flight to return to Indianapolis, which was my final destination. At HPN, a Jet Blue flight was canceled out of the blue right before AA flight #5180. Jet Blue would not let any passengers board the plane. 10 minutes later, AA began boarding flight 5180 from HPN to Charlotte. We pushed away from the gate on time, the pilot informed us we should be arriving on time to Charlotte. Then everything came to a stop. 2PM. We sat on the plane for a hour. Weather impacting the departure. The pilot informed us that an alternate route was being filed to skirt the bad weather but due to this refiled flight plan, we would need more refueling. 3PM. No one was allowed to exit the plane. I repeat no one was allowed to exit the plane! 330PM. Now, the plane resumes its place in line further back in the pack. We wait. 4PM. The pilot announced that the refiled flight plan has ""dropped out of the system"". Passengers sigh. Attendants offer water service for the 1st/only time. 500PM. We continue to wait. My seatmate informs me that fed regulations limit max tarmac stagnation at 3 hours. The attendant informs us that the refueling reset the time counter. How convenient? We were not allowed off the plane the whole time on the plane, before/at/after refueling until ~615PM. After deplaning, the flight was still not ""canceled"". I rebooked for a departure 2 days later on 7/29."
1273," Chattanooga to Washington via Charlotte. My 8:00 pm flight got cancelled on Friday. Rebooked for 5:40 am Saturday and when I woke up at 3:00 am to get ready to head to the airport I had a notification on my phone saying flight got cancelled again and rebooked for later. This has ruined my trip as I have to keep making my personal schedule changes accordingly. This is not the first time this has happened to me. I plan to make this rebooked flight my last AA flight. I am currently on the phone on hold for past 1hr:37 min. Do you want to be in my place? If no, don’t fly AA."
1274,"  Raleigh Durham to Chicago. Delayed flight 3 times, from 5:57pm to 2am. Staff is unfriendly and short-tempered, with no acknowledgement of the major disruption to many people’s schedules. I understand things happen, but the staff does that represents American Airlines act defensive and disrespectful as opposed to apologetic and as helpful as they can be given the significant disruption in service. The last time I fly with American Airlines - even if I have to connect through another airport I will not fly American Airlines because they can’t take responsibility for not being able to deliver with no regard for the effect it has in their customers"
1275,"  Albuquerque to Miami via Dallas. More than disturbed with the attitude of the AA staff at Albuquerque this morning. Walked up to the check in clerk this morning and was met with some of the worst attitude I have dealt with traveling (and I travel a lot). She spent more time trying to lecture me like a child than trying to get me on my flight, after causing me to miss the flight she finished her lecture with ""you and your handicap brother will be lucky to travel together being that your whole trip is now stand by, good luck). So I asked to chat with the supervisor who I guess was at the gate, so we proceeded to the gate, we arrived at the gate still with plenty of time to board the plane that we had already been kicked off because the agent was too lazy to check and rush one bag to the plane. As I arrived at the gate I asked for supervisor and when she appeared I asked are you a manager, her response was ""yes I dont have much time what do you want?"" Taken back once again by the courteous and helpful nature of the now management I said ""would you like to wait to chat with me until you have more time?"" She then peered at me with a cold glare and asked me to continue. I explained the attitude I encountered at the front counter she showed no element of caring and proceeded to tell me if I'm not 1.5 hours early there is no guarantee the staff at AA will do their job and get you on the flight. Other passengers were pervy to my conversation and began to share their stories of rude counter staff here today too. As a seasoned traveler I've seen every aspect of good and bad customer service is this is terrible. Many airlines will bend over backwards to get you on you flights knowing that sometimes we (customers) run a little behind and sometimes you (airlines) run behind and the end goal is transported happy customers. The attitude of the AA staff today was more like your late, here is a unnecessary lecture about being early now your screwed good luck. Lots of options of airlines and AA is slipping."
1276,"  
Dallas Ft Worth to Missoula. 2 hours and 15 after scheduled departure and leaving the gate for the second time. Left first time 15 min late, sat on tarmac 15 minutes, then decided not enough fuel. Took 45 min to get back to the gate, took another 30min to get person to pump the fuel, took another 30 minutes to leave the gate for the second time. Utter incompetence! Do not book with AA unless you have no other option."
1277,  Phoenix to Honolulu. The worst trip ever. Every American airlines flight had some type of mechanical issue. 3 times in less than 24 hours causing me to miss my son's birthday.
1278,"  
Philadelphia to Orlando. Worst trip in my 50 years of flying experience. Long delay on flight out for weather, not airlines fault. Then over 2.5 hour delay return trip for repair that was theoretically done before pulling from tarmac. Returned, deplaned and sat with few updates or alternatives. Paid over $200 for upgrades and when we asked for my wife and I to sit together, denied. Because we had booked separately and could only upgrade her to first class willing to give up first class no refund to sit together. Didn’t even try to help us, just said can’t be done. Ended up asking person next to me if they wanted first class and let them sit in wife’s spot so we could fly together."
1279,"  Philadelphia to Manchester. This airline continues to disappoint. Delayed, delayed, delayed. Why is it they can never get anyone out on time. I have airline points but will be giving them up as I will never fly this airline again, even a free flight is not worth this aggravation. Don’t apply for their credit card either as there really are no advantages to having one. No priority boarding, no free upgrades, they just suck!!"
1280,"  Mazatlan to Dallas Ft Worth.  Horrible service at Mazatlan international airport, they try to charge you for carry on luggage including threatening you that you are not going on the flight and you are going to miss your flight if you do not give them what they ask. This airline should go out of business for the tactic they use to force you to pay for carry on, never again I would use American Airlines."
1281,"Not Verified |  Buffalo to Philadelphia was fine. Not comfortable, but adequate. However, the connecting flight from Philadelphia to BWI was first delayed multiple times, and finally (an hour and a half later) cancelled altogether. According to the boarding desk personal, flights were being cancelled due to ""congestion."" Connecting flight was supposed to depart at 8:05 am, but due to all flights to BWI by American out of Philadelphia that day, the first available flight out was at 5:55 pm, which meant my afternoon meeting in Washington was impossible. Apparently Philadelphia to Baltimore was not the only flight cancelled out of Philadelphia that day; there were hundreds of people stranded by American that morning. I did manage to get a rental car and DROVE the rest of the way. Submitting for a refund was also fraught with difficulty and in the end, my $190 aborted flight wound up costing me $327 ($190 + $215 car rental + $18 unknown fee charged to my account by American Airlines two days after the flight date - $96 refund) (I have no idea what the $18 is for. It came out of my account without my approval. I'll be following up on that.) Recounting my difficulties with this airline has elicited many, many horror stories from other travelers. They apparently frequently cancel flights, stranding people, with little recompense and no apology. Do not book with American."
1282,"  Tokyo Narita to Los Angeles. First time experience with this airline on an international route. Both flights on time. Aircraft and restrooms clean. Staff was very professional and proactive on both trips. Tons of entertainment. The food won't be giving Emirates a run for its money anytime soon, but sometimes just a hot, simple meal is nice. Wifi goes from good to slow to good - maybe not worth the money. Would certainly choose them again. Is this really the same airline that seems to be getting all of these negative reviews?"
1283,  Laguardia to Chicago Ohare. Horrible experience! I will never fly with American Airlines again. They are so strict with the carry-on luggage it’s ridiculous! I travel all the time and use the same carry-on luggage I travel all the time and use the same carry-on luggage for all different airlines -  my carry on fit into their luggage sizer snugly and they still made me check it. I saw them do this with several other passengers also. I know my bag fits in the overhead bin with no problem because I travel with the same back all the time! No more American Airlines for me.
1284,"  Shanghai to West Palm Beach via Dallas Ft Worth. As configured and operated by AA, the Boeing 787 is a flying torture chamber. The seats are hard and narrow. The aisles are so tight as to be impassable and potentially unsafe. Service is perfunctory at best. Avoid at all costs! Take a connecting flight, older plane, train, bus, but avoid this aircraft, at least on this airline. The Boeing 787 is a potentially great plane, but by squeezing in seats to squeeze out every nickle of profit, AA has ruined it. For background, I am a former pilot, average size, over 1.5 million miles on AA and I have never hated a flight so much. Oh, and there were only 3 functioning lavs for probably 100 pax, if you could leapfrog over the legs and even heads in the aisle, and this flight was 80% Asian folks so we are not talking the Chicago Bears in terms of pax size! "
1285,"  Wichita to Lexington via Chicago. First flight delayed 1 hour 20 min causing me to miss my connection. My second flight had not left yet but they closed boarding as I got to the gate. Leaving me stuck at the airport for 7 hours until next the available flight. The second flight was delayed over 30 min. The first delay caused me to have incur unplanned and unnecessary rental car fees as I missed my ride at my final destination. After seeing all the other flights that were delayed today with American Airlines I will be choosing a different airline from now on, even if costs a little more."
1286,"  New York JFK to Baltimore Washington. We booked two flights with them, round trip and both connecting, and both times in separate months, the flights were cancelled due to maintenance. Same airline, same issue, and has interfered with connecting flights. We were supposed to return home in the late morning, it was delayed by an hour, then cancelled when we were supposed to start boarding. What's our comp? $24 in meal vouchers, a taxi to a different airport, and not much else. I will never fly this airline again, and since I have no preference for airlines, that's saying something. What's wrong with your planes that they're always down for maintenance?"
1287," 1st flight delayed while awaiting flight attendants, 6 other attendants already on plane kicking 6 paying customers off. Arrive 10 min before our connection is to leave. Won’t let us on because door is closed, watched plane sit at gate 20+ min more before leaving. Now stuck overnight in Phoenix at a hotel since 2.30 pm with only $60 to feed 5 people including 2 teenage boys and no transportation. Customer service only held our spots on the “new” flight and never actually booked the tickets - had to spend another hour and 3 more phone calls to get that taken care of. Family that booked months ago to ensure seating together because of some flight anxieties is now spread throughout an entire plane for a 6 hr flight. Out thousands of dollars for prepaid items in our destination, not to mention the $5k we paid AA for this terrible experience, and all we get from anyone at AA is we understand, we’re sorry, it happens, but nothing of substance When it comes to making it right. All so they can manipulate an ontime departure rating by closing a door instead of being compassionate towards their consumers and opening a door on a plane that was still sitting there and having baggage still loaded. Amazing how the doors on our original flight weren’t closed on the missing flight attendant."
1288,"  My flight was cancelled and we were just told to either get a refund or rebook another flight. All flights to George Bush airport were fully booked that day. So much of an inconvenience since in the first place i booked the very first trip to have adequate time for possible delays. Able to book going to Hobby airport. I just need to be in houston that day. Unfortunately my checked in baggage was delivered to George bush. Not an urgent need but an inconvenience. Toll free number takes 45 min to call you back. Inquired with AA ground crew at the gate who just shrugged their shoulders. They were all in a rush to go coz their gate was about to close. Finally boarded to fly to hobby airport. I could not understand a thing the flight attendant was paging overhead, her words were garbled and carelessly pronounced."
1289,"  To make a long story short, our American Airlines 9:45 flight schedule turned into a 30+ hour nightmare. The cherry on top was our lost luggage which American Airlines did not even take responsibility for, albeit our bags finally arrived at our hotel with AA's baggage sticker. The customer service was non-existent every step along the way, and when we did reach a customer service rep they could care less despite the cause of the various circumstances were of their making. Even their online complaint site is a joke. Avoid this airline if at all possible."
1290,"Not Verified |  When checking in, the website wouldn’t let me continue knowing I have a seat already reserved. The only thing I could do to continue was pay for a preferred seating. After doing that I figured I should have called before but I didn’t. So I called afterwards and they told me they wouldn’t refund it because “it’s policy that it’s non refundable”. The representative was very professional but the supervisors she said she spoke with were awful. I wish I couldn’t talked to them myself. Yes it’s only $14, but they’re always charging for extras and it’s stupid! I told them there was something wrong with the website since it wouldn’t let me continue. They didn’t care. I have flown with American before and hated it. Hopefully my actual flight goes a lot better than the experience I had today."
1291,"Not Verified |  Worst customer service ever. They kept delaying the flight, and after four hours of waiting, cancelled the flight and could not offer any other flights. We were flying from Newark to Charlotte. Long lines of waiting to try to get another flight. We were treated like cattle. One recommendation was to drive to Baltimore and take a flight from there. Management was rude and ignored us. Then an hour on hold when I called to get my refund. Never again."
1292,  My flight was late leaving causing me to miss my connecting flight that was suppose to land at noon in Kansas City and I’m suppose to arrive back at fort riley by tonight at midnight. The earliest flight they could give me was 8pm leaving philli and arriving in Kansas City at 1045. It’s a two hour drive back to fort riley causing me to be late to signing back onto post. This was already a sad time for me as I flew back home for emergency leave for a funeral and now going back to work I will be late signing back onto post. Which is a very big deal. When I went to customer service in Philadelphia the agent was extremely rude and unprofessional. Telling me there’s absolutely nothing he would do for me unless I magically appeared with orders. I tried to show him my leave paperwork and he said orders or nothing at all.
1293,  New York to Columbia via Chicago. This is the worst experience I've ever had flying. American airlines is a nightmare. Cancelled their flight leaving me stranded at the airport and playing redirection games while I sought for assistance. No customer empathy. Even in the dream or nightmare would never fly American airlines again.
1294,"  Orlando to New York. After reading reviews, I was very surprised how good the flight was. Left on time, good food and good service. Seats were good, only 4 rows of 2. Plane left on time and arrived on time. No issues whatsoever."
1295,"Not Verified |  Chicago to Dayton. Flight took off on time. After 30 minutes of odd flying, pilot announces cabin pressure was not being maintained. Flight was diverted to Chicago. After landing it was announced that the cargo door was not properly closed. They closed the cargo door and maintenance performed pressure check and we boarded the flight again, three hours later. I’ve contacted American Airlines several times to find our how they can miss a cargo door not being sealed prior to take off. The flight crew was blaming the Chicago ground crew. This concerns me regarding safety for future flights. American Airlines has been dismissive and has responded that they simply don’t have that information and there is no one that they can direct me to for answers. Pathetic. Flight attendants were very pleasant, otherwise."
1296,"  I had a flight booked with AA on July 23 at 7PM, they kept sending emails with delay notifications till 11 PM to finally cancel the flight. There started the nightmare - per their representatives AA does not have to provide anything because the cancellation reason was weather (something not out of discussion since there was another flight at 9PM and it was not cancelled). Parents traveling with kids, elderly persons on wheelchairs, etc and AA said that they could not provide any food, hotel,taxi. Everybody was re-scheduled on AA flights from July 25 till 29 (6 days after the booked flight) after any questions their representative kept saying his is not us, this is the company and how they want to address this issue.. I ended up buying a ticket on another airline to flight next day. I never could imagine that behavior from AA."
1297,"Not Verified |  Pretty appalling experience. Have never encountered such poor customer service before. Staff were unhelpful, unfriendly and insensitive to those of us onboard that had very tight connect flight times. Completely unorganised disembarking which resulted in myself and my sister missing our connecting flight, despite telling staff our concerns and seeing that we were visible stressed and upset and about potentially not being able to get home, they did not seem to care or want to help us leave the flight a bit before those who had a little bit longer for connecting flights/remaining in Charlotte. I have never experienced this in many years of travelling with various airlines, worst experiment and left myself and my sister more stressed and upset. Will never fly American airline again."
1298,"  An early flight from Orlando to MIA. Check in went smoothly. As we had fairly heavy baggage, the check in staff was really helpful to advise us as to what to do to save money and at the same time adhere to airline policies. All worked ok. After a fairly strenuous TSA check went to departures hall and took the shuttle to the gate. Boarding procedure went ok, even though despite of our seat numbers were called last again. Staff were very helpful and courteous at the gate and on board. The cabin was clean. Just a bottle of non-spring water was offered, which we did decline. A fine flight, departing and arriving on time with staff being efficient. Only downturn is the airline's policy on luggage and staff uniforms that look aged."
1299,"  It all started when Ticketing agent in San Jose could not complete a family checkin for over an hour. Caused us to miss our 8am plane to DFW even though we were at airport 2 hours before departure. Waited for the next plane scheduled to leave at 1:37pm. But they hadn’t handled our ticket change correctly and we weren’t even booked on the flight. Another agent got us on as the last 3 passengers on board. American had previously announced the crew for the next flight was missing and another crew was busing in from San Francisco. Departed 45 mins late with a tight 1 hour connection in DFW. American assured us that all of the connections would be made. Upon arrival, hurried to change terminals and arrived at gate with 5 mins to spare. No one there even though American agents said they would call ahead and tell them we were coming. Put on next flight scheduled for 10:25 departure to Northwest Arkansas. American announces they don’t have a plane for this flight. They announce that a plane is due at 10:36. Now due to depart at 11:00. We’ll see! Incompetent ticketing agent! Missing crew! Missing plane! I think I’ll stick to Southwest and just drive to Tulsa! No thanks American!"
1300,"Not Verified |  Boarded plane in Detroit Mi on July 23! Pilot said we had to make a stop in Greensboro due to bad weather, so we flew into Greensboro and were there for 2 hours. Pilot said we would refuel and head to Charlotte at 6:57. We were left Greensboro until 7:45, so I missed my connection to Tri Cities airport! The plane wasn't refueled until after 7. When I got to Charlotte, the second flight going to Tri Cities was cancelled. I was given a phone number to call to make another reservation and was told it was tomorrow July 24 at 2:40. I'm sitting here with several other people whose flights were screwed up! I will never fly American airlines again."
1301,"  San Diego to Phoenix. Flight from PHX was two hours late. Then the return flight was also two hours late. The app said “on time” until the very last minute so there was no way to salvage any of the time. On the day of the flight I got a seating change via the app. Changed us to seats in different rows. Tried to call about it, but the automated system said 1.5 hour wait. Turns out the original seat assignments I got were in a non existent row. These people are a bunch of screw ups. It used to be a good airline, but it sure isn’t anymore."
1302,  Melbourne Fl to Dayton via Charlotte. Our flight was scheduled at 8:45 and I received an email this morning at 6:00 that it was delayed and we will miss our connection flight. We knew at the airport that this flight has been delayed for the last 5 consecutive days. If I would have known this in advanced I will schedule my flight for a day early. I considered this an abuse of power by the airline.
1303,"  Chicago to Los Angeles. The worst customer service ever given! The staff isn’t very polite they’re very curt with you, you ask for a manager or person in charge they won’t get you one they say they’re not available. From a delayed 4hr flight that started in France not allowing enough time for the 4hr layover we originally had in Chicago they rescheduled us on united giving us 90 minute layover which we missed because they made us go get our bags go through TSA and then recheck our bags etc.. they ended up putting us on another flight that was canceled long story short after 36 hrs at Chicago O’Hare trying to get home American Airlines did nothing to help us we called customer service we asked for a person in charge (non available), not until we had to get loud with them that they finally got us on stand by again for like the 7th time that we were able to get on a flight! We spend $300 on a hotel stay that wasn’t planned and to top it off American Airlines sent our luggage with United we had no clothes and our luggage was at LAX!"
1304,"  Syracuse to Cancun via Charlotte. Vacation ruined, 2nd time last year vacation to Jamaica ruined (lost 1 day flight cancelled), this year lost the bag came after 1 day. On our way back flight delayed, 1 more day in transit! Wife flew from JFK to Syracuse last year lost the bag, will never fly AA any more. I do not care about the entertainment, staff kindness, food, wifi, I am talking about basic stuff. Flights for the most part delayed, cancelled etc, bags expectedly messed up, delayed,lost. I cannot remember a trip without issues."
1305,"  Minneapolis to Philadelphia. Do not fly this airline! When booking it may seem cheaper but they nickel and dime you for every little thing which cost you more in the long run.  My son had a bicycle that could only fit in an oversized bag. When we went to check in they charged us $150 extra because there was a bike inside the bag. Not reading word for word the baggage policy, as most passengers don't, we were unaware bikes were not allowed unless in a box. The manager and the baggage check in person accused us of Fraud and stealing from the airline. We explained it was not stealing No fraud because we were unaware of of the policy. Nonetheless they both continued harassing us and would not make any accommodations even though my wife is a frequent business flyer on their airline. They charged us $150 extra. Never flying this Airline again."
1306,  Delayed in Roanoke 2 hours trying to get to Charlotte. Last month I missed my connecting flight as a result of a delayed flight. I will be seeing another airline next time even if I have to get on four planes to get where I am going. I am not getting what I am paying for.
1307,"  Miami to Tampa. bWorst experience of my life flying ever! I fly a ton for work and I have never ever been treated so poorly. My husband and I have the American Airlines card and have access to their lounge which we pay $400 for annually. The treatment from the staff of the Miami airport tonight is outrageous. We will be canceling and never flying with them again. I understand delays are out of their control but we sat on and unconditioned plane for an hour just to then sit at the airport with literally no update on our constantly delayed flight for hours. To say I’m outraged and disappointed is a major understatement. This has ruined our entire vacation. I can’t believe I’m even paying for this flight they call service. Please, never fly American. I know we won’t be ever again."
1308,  I’ve had the most horrid experiences with American. I’ve been delayed both flights to North Carolina from Washington and back by at least an hour. I was supposed to get in tonight at 845 and catch my bus to Bellingham from Seattle but they delayed the fight at the last minute didn’t bother to say anything and I had to pay for another full bus ticket to get home.  Coming up I was delayed an hour as well. I think mainly their boarding protocols and strict baggage guidelines and I don’t read the times points to there bad satisfaction for me. Planes are nice though but that’s about it. Of all the airlines I’ve flown American has the most delays beyond anything I’ve seen and do not want to travel with them again. 
1309,"  Miami to Laguardia. My flight was scheduled for 8:32pm. When we get on the plane, we were told shortly after that there was going to be a delay, which was understandable due to the weather in NY. Soon later, they made everyone get off of the plane because it was too hot on the plane and the air conditioner wasn’t effective, and they ran out of drinking water. We get off of the plane and wait for an update. No accurate update was given. We were simply told that the weather was bad and that now our Captain can’t fky because he’s over his time. They called several more captains and it was too late for them all to fly. They finally found a captain that Can fly. We get back in the plane, which was crammed. We waited almost an hour. I asked the flight attendant what was going on and what time we were taking off. She said she did not know. I asked for water because it was very hot and was told they ran out still. So we were going to be on a 3 hour flight with no water. Soon later, we all get texts that our flight was cancelled. We asked the flight attendant and they had no information. Finally we were told by the captian that it was cancelled. It was past 12am at this point. It took forever for them to re-in-board the plane. We finally get off and get directed to the reservation area by an AA employee by the name of Ana.Short Spanish looking lady.With no patience, she very rudely screams at us while swinging her finger in our face, to get in a single file line and “don’t even think about cutting”.It’s not like she made that comment before and people ignored her. She has an attitude right away.I was very annoyed because we have been on and off that plane several times for hours and have also waited a very long time, just for the flight to be cancelled at 12 in the morning.Then take a shuttle to an airport at 2 in the morning with a rescheduled flight at 8am. Lost out on an entire day of pay because of this airline. I would have been less upset if the staff wasn’t so rude and if they acted like they cared that we were bounced around for hours. Everything was unorganized and unprofessional."
1310,"Not Verified |  Flew from Albuquerque to Miami with a layover in Dallas. Attendants refused to assist with check in demanding the Kiosk be used. Refueling delays in Dallas. Luggage arrived slightly damaged, but filthy. Clean your luggage compartments!"
1311,"  Las Vegas to Miami. Today they  made passengers from the Vegas red eye into Miami, wait 1.5 hours for bags at 5am. When I complain at the counter the clerk told me that nothing could be done and the supervisor was in a call and would not pay attention to this service to the passengers. There was no storm. Clerks at the bag counters were beyond careless. Shame on you American Airlines for treating passengers like this."
1312,"  Philadelphia to Charlotte. Traveling with an infant and family. Called and paid an additional 25.00 per head to ensure we got seating assignments together since we had an infant. Agent assured us seats were together. Got to airport, no seat assignment, and was informed there was nothing they could do. Gate agent was rude and a great representation of the Company and how they treat their customers."
1313,"  Flying with my wife from MIA to Orlando International, after spending the night in Miami arriving from Madrid. Check in - bag drop went ok. Staff at check in was polite enough. TSA also went smoothly. Flight was quite short - about 55 minutes, so on economy there was a choice between orange juice and water. Got water but was not spring water so I did not consume it. Cabin staff was polite, seats were comfortable and appearance of the cabin was tidy. Nevertheless, cannot award full marks because of the airline's baggage policy, boarding procudure (zones - appears that whatever seat we are seating and zone assigned we board last!), uniforms of some members of staff - some look rather worn for many many years. Overall a good flight."
1314,"  Norfolk to St Louis. I had the most unpleasant experience on your airline July 4th weekend. I arrived at Norfolk International Airport shortly after 10am for a flight that was going to St Louis, Missouri. The flight was delayed due to weather conditions in Charlotte; which I completely understood. However, after waiting at the airport for about 5 hours, we finally boarded the plane. We sat on the plane for 3 hours before we left to head to Charlotte. By the time we made it to Charlotte I had missed my flight and was put on a different one. Minutes before getting ready to board the plane they tell us the flight is cancelled. There was one more plane going to St Louis, and they only had a few seats available on it and it was first come first serve. I was put on a waitlist because the seats were full. Luckily, I was able to get on. After waiting around for about 10 hours with a million delays and a cancelled flight, it was beyond stressful. Worst experience ever. It didn’t help that the people at the airports weren’t very friendly at all. I was highly disappointed with the experience. I was supposed to arrive in St. Louis at 3pm and didn’t arrive until midnight."
1315,  Athens to Miami. I am just writing this review to praise an  individual American Airline worker at the ATL airport.  I was very late for my flight and even though the desk had already been closed for 45 minutes and the luggage belt had turned off he helped me out a ton and printed the documents I needed faster than I could have done. He also took care of my luggage and was at my gate to assure me of that before I boarded the plane. I do a lot of travelling and I haven’t had such great help!
1316,"Not Verified |  Philadelphia to Atlanta. Absolutely horrible. Not only was my flight delayed by 4 hrs than its original departure time of 5:30, but they also left the lights on the airplane the entire ride from 9:30 to 11:30 while most passengers wanted to sleep, this prohibited a lot of passengers including myself from sleeping. The only snack your offered are pretzels. I also didn't get my bag about 12 to 12:30. The constant delays were unreal. I didn't get settled at home until 1:30 in the morning, which caused problems for me the next day. Then when I opened my luggage the next day it was clear that my luggage was handled extremely poorly. I wrapped a glass picture frame in clothes so it wouldn't get damaged in flight as I've done before with delta without a fragile sticker being placed on it and with delta it would always be fine, when I opened my bag the frame was shattered and the broken glass had ruined my picture. There was also a 10min delay getting off of the plane. Then when I went to the train to go to baggage claim, the train was very slow, not just arriving to pick us up at the gate, but moving to baggage claim. I'd sooner fly on any other airline before ever flying American airlines ever again! Not to mention the train and airport was cold as hell, colder than normal."
1317,"Not Verified |  American Airlines seems to be uncapable to keep flight on time. I booked via British Airways and have a cancelled flight in NYC JFK. Rebooked next day via EWR with an initial proposal to have me in an hotel in LA Guardia after fighting for 1 hours with customer service I got an hotel in Newark and was able to enjoy 2,5 hours of sleep before my next flight going to Dallas before reaching my destination to Vegas. So I started my conference late and completely exhausted. Then on my way home, I discovered an unknown policy (was told is documented but could not find it despite search AA website) that you cannot register your luggage before 4 hours before the flight (funnily enough TSA ask to come 3 hours before minimum for international so be between 3 and 4 hours before otherwise like myself you will not be able to register your luggage and be stuck in an airport that has no business lounge facility. As a first class passenger I would expect a much better service so I will endeavour to never fly American again. I appreciated the service desk in JFK that thanked me for remaining so calm while she was getting annoyed for me. Is someone in AA listening to staff on the ground they seem to be facing and understanding issues much better than the management that creates policies. I will avoid this airline!"
1318,"Not Verified |  Portland to Charleston via Charlotte.  We had a horrible experience. Our connecting flight was cancelled, when I went to the counter I was told my flight would be the next day. I'm three hours from my destination but because of the computer glitch they had days prior there were no rental cars. Anywhere. I asked to be put on a sooner flight and was given the flight at noon. 5 delays and 4 gate changes later we took off at 4 pm. I had to ask for a meal voucher for my child since we were at the airport for 12hrs. We were finally given one for lunch for 24.00 with the airport food costs that wawas enough for him to get a burger meal and me a drink. I will never fly American again. Those poor people working there have no power to give customer service for c."
1319,"Not Verified |  Flew from Grand Rapids to VPS Florida and no problems on flight there. It departed around 730 am. I will say the staff seems to be rude and uncaring all the way around. It seems like they all hate their job. I left on a Thurs and returned on a Thurs late after noon to my final destination. That's not good since my arrival should have been Tuesday at 7 PM in Grand Rapids. Left Florida to Michigan via Washington Regan at 130 PM and didn't leave airport till 1030 am the next day. They were trying to put me on Thurs at 5 PM until I informed them I needed medication and couldnt wait that long. Also Nowhere to sleep. All chairs with arm bars. We we never offered a blanket or pillow. It sounded like constant construction the entire night and I was so cold from air blowing on us. I would have considered sleeping the floor but I had nothing but what I was wearing and back pack with limited meds and some personal hygiene. They wont offer you reimbursement because it a reason not covered. There is one customer service line which I and about 100 other people were in to find out about our flight. I spent about 100 on food which included snacks and water. I was so cold I bought 2 sweatshirt because 40 each or 2 for 50. Got kicked out of one side after last flight out and put into mid area until early flights came in and went back through security again. It was complete nightmare. I was only grateful I was alone and didn't have kids with me. I will never fly with American Airlines again. I making sure I bring my carry on luggage in case this ever happens again I am prepared. I'm am completely floored they call this customer service and treat their customers this way. There was a couple who had their flight cancelled 3 times and sat over night behind me. They were told the captain had too many hours so no one to fly the plane, also short on flight attendant."
1320," Prague to Akron via Philadelphia.I flew on American Airlines twice. Once on the way to Europe in early June 2018, and once on the way back to the United States in mid-July 2018. On the way to Europe, my flights were delayed several times and I was 12 hours past my arrival time. On the way back, my flights were delayed and rebooked a total of six times. I eventually made it to Philadelphia at midnight (14 hours later than expected) and they gave me a hotel voucher where I could stay until 1pm the next day when my flight left for home. After waiting 40 minutes for the shuttle that never came, I ubered to the hotel. The hotel said American Airlines had met their quota and that they had actually sold all their rooms. I tried calling the corporate number and they said there was nothing they could do from there. I tried to call the airport and they redirected back to corporate. So I found the shuttle back to the airport where I was told that they didn’t have any more vouchers but if I keep my receipts they should reimburse me. Instead, I called reservations and demanded an earlier flight, which they somehow found. They dropped the ball on almost every aspect of this trip and I will never fly with them again."
1321,"Not Verified |  This was by far the most disgusting experience. Originally, I had been supposed to take a 8:19pm connecting flight at Boston to go to Philadelphia from Tokyo. As soon as the flight from Tokyo landed at Boston Logan Airport, I received two texts notifying the delay without being provided any reasons. At that moment, the flight was still supposed to fly at 10 pm, so I decided to stick to it and I checked my suitcase in. After that, they keep sending the delay notifications, which ended up saying ""the flight was cancelled and your new flight is 5:25 am one"" As expected, they never provided any reasons at all and I was kicked out of the security area around 12am, which forced me to spend some 4 hours outside and come back to line up for the security again around 4 am. When I asked about my suitcase I checked in at the gate after this reschedule, the crew said ""that is a separated system and we have no information."" The new flight departed without any trouble and I got my suitcase at Philly airport, which was the only good news. After I came back home, I posted a complaint through their system, which is not responded at all for more than 2 days. I would not blame any individual employee for this, but I should conclude that American Airlines' overall attitude towards passengers is nothing but disrespect. I will never ever ever fly with American Airlines again."
1322,"Not Verified |  American Airlines flight from Dallas to Charlotte was good. Then my flight from Charlotte to Fayetteville was cancelled. It finally did rebook only to be cancelled again. Now I have to spend the night, unexpectedly and catch a flight at 8am to a different city after waiting for hours to find out it was cancelled. Then I wasn't offered a voucher for a motel and I had to pay for that. Then I had to get a family member to drive 2 hrs to get me and 2 hrs back to try and get ready for my grandpa's funeral, the whole reason for the trip. Now for my trip home. 3 flights cancelled before I was given a flight on a different airline and 2 days later. I missed 2 days of work, I have 2 small children at home with out me. It was a horrible experience and all they offer me was miles to use. I don't even fly. This was an unexpected situation. There should have been some reimbursement from the 600.00 ticket. Not very good business."
1323,"  Boston to New Orleans via Charlotte. Our first flight was delayed by 8hours 26minutes since they had to do maintenance on the plane for 3-4 hours. After the maintenance, they noticed that they are missing one flight attendant, and we had to wait for him to arrive for over 4 hours. We were told that we would get a hotel at Charlotte, where our connecting flight would leave and were we would have to wait for several hours (original change time was 2 hours, now 6.5 hours). When we arrived, we were met by very rude loud American Airlines staff that were willing to do nothing about the matter or help us in anyway. Hotels were booked, but nonetheless they did not offer food or anything in compensation. Or even an apology (like it was our fault). To sumarize: if you want very bad unhelpful and rude service, delayed flights with sleeping on airports and lies atop of lies how ""they will handle it"". Fly with American Airlines. I certainly will never again."
1324," Roswell to Louisville via Dallas. Excuse after excuse with delayed flights. Started off with delayed aircraft then told it was a maintenance issue and now with the flight leaving supposedly leaving two hours after it’s original departure time we’re being told we are waiting on a crew! Where was the crew that was supposed to be on the original flight? There’s no excuse for this, send someone from management to explain the issue not hide behind your desk and let your poor gate agents catch the brunt of people’s frustrations. Only using American because I booked through employer website, won’t use personal funds to fly this airline. Delayed my flight last week for an hour waiting on a wheel chair to be brought to remove a patient from the arriving aircraft. Poor service!"
1325,  Highly disappointed I suppose to travel July 16 from Sioux Falls to Cincinnati but 3 times delays and finally got 1 flight but to get another connection flight is to wait overnight in the airport. It takes me 2days to reach my destination which is 3 hrs total flying lengths. It’s seems like they care their business more not for customers time.
1326,  I fly twice a month and every other trip is delayed by four to five hours due to maintenance problems. There has never been an attempt to say sorry for the inconvenience or an attempt to make up for the problems in any way. It’s basically deal with it and go away. I have flown on this airline for six months now and it’s always the same never gets better. This will be my last trip on this airline and I advise everyone one else to stay away.
1327, I was traveling from Miami to Washington DC on 14 July 2018 on Flight #AA2363. I usually prefer to travel with American Airlines as I have enjoyed their customer services until today when in two occasions was treated very rudely by two of their associates. People like that shouldn't work in customer service as it ruins the good reputation of a business. It was a very unpleasant experience that I hope not to encounter again.
1328,"  I flew American Airlines on business trips domestic and international numerous times but never with family on an intentional trip. Unfortunately I did travel this time and I swear not to do the same mistake again. I wanted to request a vegetarian meal for my family and I could not figure how to do it from the website that I visit almost every week. I end up calling customer service and they had to update the meal preference. However they miss updating one of the family members and guess what, 2 Asian vegetarian meals for 3 of us.  I was traveling with an infant, so requested a bassinet almost 2 months in advance. Even called the customer service and I get a standard response that I need to request at the airport. I am a platinum pro traveler and I still could not block any bulkhead rows because I had a lap child in the reservation. I go to the airport 3.5 hours before the departure time and request bassinet. I was told that I need to contact the gate agent. I go ask the gate agent and she tells me that no bulk head seats are available as all of those seats were sold at a premium to other passengers. When I checked out those seats, there were no infants in them. This was a shocker. My next 2 legs were with Etihad and they had the bulk head rows assigned to us even before requesting them. The air hostesses were arrogant and would not like to entertain simple questions like “hey do have some fruits for the kids?” I specifically asked for the name to complain and she would not divulge her name. A simple yes or know would have sufficed but all I get is ""Why are you bothering me"" look. This kind of behavior deters families traveling with American and could cost in the long run. No point in whining about Middle East airlines capturing the international travel market. Not because of their price but because of their service. Companies that ignore customer service have perished. Better learn the lesson and improve. Business travelers travel alone (1 ticket) but families (3-4 tickets on average). Wake up before it is too late."
1329,"  Ft Walton to Dallas Ft Worth. American Airlines is by far one of the worst airlines I have flown with. I have been traveling a lot for work lately and have been on over 4 flights in the past week with them. Each flight has been delayed, their employees do nothing to inform their guest of the delay or what is going on. American Airlines used to be very organized and customer friendly, however, after my past few experience I will never book a flight through them again."
1330," I can understand a delay due to the weather but the unprofessionalism and rude attitude from the representatives at DFW airport was not necessary. The customer service in Vancouver was not much better and when my girlfriend’s baggage failed to arrive not much was done to assure it would arrive in one of the next two flights the same day and left us staying at the hotel since my girlfriend didn’t have any clothes. Too much failure on American Airlines end when it comes to customer service and inspiring information for delayed baggage. Overall this is the 2nd terrible experience with this airline. Inflight food beverage quality is down. Customer service is non-existent. Poor baggage handling. I can safely say that my family, my girlfriend and of course myself will never fly American Airlines again."
1331, Honolulu to Phoenix. Trying to return home after honeymoon plane was delayed on runway for 3 hours and then finally at 1.30am deboarded plane just to wait another 2-3 hours for hotel voucher which serves no purpose since our flight which we had to change ourselves to Delta was leaving at 11am. My wife and I have been up for over 24 hours and still have another 25 before returning home. The only kind person was the morning ticketing agent who at least gave us a food voucher. Customer service was non-existent and my family and myself will never fly American Airlines again! Thank you for making my honeymoon unforgettable!
1332," Charlotte to Dallas. Worst airline! I fly weekly for work and I have to unfortunately use American Airlines because of my projects budget. Every time I Fly with American, my flight is always delayed! How inconvenient and annoying can this airline be? Then when you call for customer service they are so rude and inconsiderate! I’ve had flights that were connecting and I’ve had to run for my life to catch it because my flight was delayed for 2 hours. This airline always makes it a point to disappoint me. The best airline thus far is Southwest and Delta."
1333," I am really disappointed with American Airlines. I got one cancellation and two delays for my flights. It was not delayed because of the weather problems, but because of maintenance problems. Moreover, my flight was supposed to be at 10.30 am and they just arbitrarily changed our flight to 10.00 pm without explanation. I wanted to get a refund and change my flight to another airline because I have an important schedule. However, they just say they are not sure whether I can get a refund or not. I will never use this airline again."
1334," This flight from Dallas to Philadelphia is notorious for its delay and not respecting the time of people. I think they are understaffed and have arguments and change it in time with different arguments. The most annoying thing is their announcement of delays. They keep changing the time every hour with different arguments. It shows clearly their inability to say the truth. I flew with them five times and four times I had delays of over 4 to 5 hours. They disrespect the time of people because they have no competition in some major cities. I would never recommend American Airlines. I would never book them anymore, I would rather book a connecting flight to avoid them."
1335,"Not Verified |  Tampa to Maui via Phoenix. Over the past three years I’ve noticed a massive downgrade in American airline aircraft. As a result of me working in Maui my days of travel always involve long flights. Since of lately American Airlines has repeatedly shown poor customer service as well outdated aircrafts taking away from the customer experience. This is my sixth flight in a row either coming into or departing from Maui that my 7+ hour flight lacks charging stations or entertaining screens. Due it’s lack of amenities, customer care and high prices, has caused me to reconsider my loyalty to this airline. For such expensive and long flights to Hawaii you would think that American would offer its newest aircrafts not oldest."
1336,"Not Verified |  Amarillo to Destin. Seriously the worst airline ever. This is one of many awful experiences with them and it keeps getting worse. After making me more that 6 hours late (which i can understand for weather), they fail to get my luggage on the airplane. Between all of the delays they had plenty of time to switch my luggage so I do not understand why my stuff is missing. Minus a select few, most of the service is terrible."
1337,  Port au Prince to San Francisco via Miami. Due to civil unrest in Haiti we cannot enter the country from Santo Domingo without purchasing a $500 ticket to the states. American Airlines wants us to enter Haiti during the chaos to catch our flight back home anyway or charge us $200 each to change our origin city. We've explained several times we can't even get there. No buses nor planes are leaving Santo Domingo straight to Haiti. They didn't care. Even in such a dangerous situation they want to earn as much as they can. Forfeit our safety I guess. It seems extremely cold hearted seeing they've raised the travel warning to level 4 just 2 days ago.
1338,"  Washington to Miami . The gate attendant at Washington was extremely rude and unprofessional. After we waited 30 minutes on the late plane, the gate attendant rushed us all on the plane and stopped me to insist that I must check my bags on an empty flight. I had 1 suitcase, 1 duffel bag, 1 small fannie pack on my waist and a black plastic food bag that I purchased at the airport. The attendant’s 1st option with handling me was to call security, no compassion or customer service or people skills. She wouldn’t explain to me the policy or other alternatives. My flight experience was ruined. I felt alone and depleted. The other gate attendant that came minutes later in full uniform couldn’t believe the way the 1st gate attendant was treating me.  special shout-out to Miami American Airlines baggage claim staff. They were the total opposite as they listened to my situation and handled the issue effortlessly with great customer service! They turned my day all the way around. They should train the DCA staff!"
1339,"Not Verified |  This should actually be a zero star review. We (a family of four) was suppose to leave Newport News, VA on a Tuesday going to Honolulu, HI. Our flight got delayed until Wednesday due to computer issues at the Charlotte airport. I was okay with that since we heard there were issues there for the previous days. What happened next is beyond irritating. On Wednesday we boarded the plane in Newport News and was later deplaned due to a brake issue. They rescheduled our flights for the next day and changed our location to an airport 45 minutes away (Norfolk, VA). On Thursday, they canceled our flight again stating that there was no crew to fly the plane out of Norfolk. So in the end we got to Hawaii on Friday, three days later, a shortened vacation and the worst part, we missed my niece’s wedding! What do you think they did to compensate us? Keep in mind between my husband and myself we sent American five emails regarding this situation. Their solution, give us 15,000 miles! Really, who would want to fly with them after this. Who cares about the miles at this point! We missed the wedding and days of our vacation!"
1340,  Miami to new York JFK. Boarded the plane and pulled away from gate only to find out twenty minutes in that we needed air pressure and a boost and we waited 3 hours with no air in 100 degree weather in Miami just for mechanics to come fix the problem that they said was no big deal. Then we had to wait about an extra hour for a push car to come push the plane and only the crew shows up without the starter car! Had to wait another half hour for them to find the car . And all this we were only told 2.5 hours in that we may leave the plane but the kicker is they were not giving back luggage and were putting whoever wanted to leave on standby to wait whenever they decide to give you another flight. They said it could be tonight tomorrow or next week. How convenient. Who is going to go anywhere without their luggage? Basically didn’t make sense for anyone to leave so we had no choice. On top of all that the flight attendants were the laziest I ever met. I am 6 months pregnant with an 8 month old baby. We were both sweating and overheated. My baby couldn’t even eat it was so hot for her and I asked one for water about an hour in and she pointed to her metal cabinet draws where the water is. Was I supposed to get it myself ? Who knows. I had to start crying to finally get water. Then they said that maybe they should start giving out some water. Maybe? Is that a joke. People are dehydrating. When my husband asked one for iced water she just stared at him with a blank face she only got it once he yelled and then she got mad he yelled ! They only started giving out water about two hours in and had to ration it because they ran out. People had connecting flights in JFK that they missed and you would think they gate manager would help them reschedule or provide them with a compensation but no. Our only compensation was a movie and 1 pack of cookies. I could go on and on. So unprofessional so lazy so incompetent. They should be out of business and should be ashamed of themselves
1341,"Not Verified |  Denver to Dallas Ft Worth. The worst experience of my life. The staff is rude , there is no desire to ensure that you get home quickly, and they nickel and dime you more than Spirit. I was on a standby flight which I still paid 100 bucks for and because I was D3, literally anyone who is D1 or D2 can cut in front of you at any time. I got to the airport for a 5am flight at 2:30am, and was bumped off the next 7 flights. I had to take a vacation day from work because I couldn’t get back in time. There was no communication and they couldn’t ensure that I get back because “that’s just the standby game.” Well, if I am still a paying customer, and if I’ve been sitting here for 14 hours then I should be treated as such. After the 5th missed flight, I finally folded and bought a ticket myself ($65) so I could get home. Since I bought this ticket the morning of, I was on boarding group 9. This means that you’re only allowed one personal item which was never conveyed to me. Even though my bag was carry-on size, I had to pay $50 for them to check my bag as I was boarding because I was in group 9 and that’s not allowed apparently, and they were out of room in the overhead storage bins since THEY oversold the flight. None of which, by the way was my fault.  Use another airline."
1342,Not Verified |  Mexico to Boston via Phoenix. The worst flight ever. They separated all of us on the flight including my kids. On our return flight we had a connection in Phoenix to go to Boston but we had to go through customs and collect our bags because we came from Mexico. The baggage belt broke and delayed us getting our bags. My husband stayed behind to get the bags and ran to the gate. I told the flight attendants and they shut the door in his face. The flight was for 3:30 and they shut the door at 3:25. 6 people missed their flights that day. Awful service and bad attitudes.
1343,"  Flew American Airlines from San Jose to Phoenix. Flight was delayed 7 hours and all I got was a $12 dinner voucher, enough for a snack, not a dinner. On the other flight the pilots were over 30 mins late."
1344,  Dallas to Hong Kong. Seated in Main Cabin Extra. Plenty of leg room to endure the 15 hour + journey in both directions. Only 2 options for dinner (cod and pork). Former was surprisingly flavorful and tasty. Mid flight snack was stromboli and salted caramel gelato. Breakfast eggs/hash browns. Typical airline food. Nothing out of the extra-ordinary. Service was nothing more than necessary. Flight attendants appear to be more concerned about getting service over with. Entertainment choices were plentiful. I have flown long haul with Emirates and American Airlines' service pales compared to the former.
1345," The ticket was issued by American Airlines and one leg was flown by Alaska Airlines. American does not provide a boarding pass to the Alaska Airlines flight. Moreover, when I called them and also when checking in, American Airlines indicated that I will get the boarding pass at the gate. Wrong! I discovered that after I missed my connecting flight because I had to go to the ticketing area of Alaska Airlines to get the boarding pass and not at the gate as I was told by 3 American Airlines representatives! American Airlines will issue a ticket flying with Alaska Airlines but they fail to inform you that they are completely separate flights and for checking in luggage I also had to pay Alaska Airlines. American Airlines promised to refund the $25 but they denied my claim, stating that I should read the small print on their website and not believe the words of the American airlines representative and supervisor!"
1346,  Burlington to Omaha via Philadelphia. Multiple mechanical delays are way too frequent! Delayed now by 2 hours. No plan announced as yet. Ridiculous. We boarded and sat on tarmac for an hour. Then back to gate. Now in terminal again. Get your act together! I don’t believe we are getting our money’s worth at all.
1347,"  San Diego to Dallas. So disappointed with this airline. There was a 5 hour delay, with no announcement no email no nothing. They just have us sitting out here blinking. Flight was supposed to be super early morning and yet we are still here hours and hours later. We had to Google the flight ourselves to find out why we were not leaving as scheduled. No one said anything. Customer service phone number was not helpful either. Very frustrated and disappointed with the lack of communication, not to mention how those screws up my work plans for tomorrow!!"
1348,  Philadelphia to Miami. In the last 2 years more and more frequently the service is getting worse. Today we are waiting on board more than hours for catering. Wait more than a 1 day and American airlines canceled the trip. We almost lost the trip to Aruba. Preview I traveled to Cuba and they offered a Voucher for 2000 whoever is canceling the trip The service is getting worse and worse No respectful at all.
1349,"Not Verified |  Flew American Airlines from Dallas to San Diego. Got a 2hr delay and on top of that had us in the heat. They turned the AC on for about 15 min then turned it down. They were fixing a brake on a wing, shouldn’t they be checking this prior to departure. Horrible service."
1350,"  I had a connecting flight from Los Angeles to Portland  after arriving from Fiji. My plane time was changed from 2:35pm to 9:30pm. When I asked at the counter, I was told that the travel agent should have informed me. I know it was a lie because this is the second time they used the same excuse. Travel agent was not aware of it at all. Am making sure that I am never traveling with American Airlines again."
1351," La Guardia to Miami. July 3 last flight out to Miami, boarded 20 minutes late due to late incoming aircraft. C6 gates have completely insufficient area to board even a 737, passengers blocking the egress of passengers even after reminded several times by the gate agent to clear a path for them. Things got better from there. The new 737MAX has great overhead bins and lighting, the First Class seat was honestly not as comfortable as the previous 737-8's were, particularly in full recline. You feel like you need a big pillow in the small of your back to give some lumbar support. Pitch was fine. The FA were gracious and smiling, and always checking on the customers. They were really great. PDB was offered to all 16 F passengers. Meal service was excellent, served polite and efficiently. I got beef with quinoa and asparagus, the beef was tender and red in the middle. Salad and choice of roll and warm cookie too! My travel partner opted for the pre-ordered the Asian vegetarian which was Indian inspired and truly delicious, spicy but not overly so. Service on American is excellent, FA's made sure our drinks were filled. Arrived 20 minutes early despite the delayed boarding. I wish AA would do something about those new seats in First"
1352,Not Verified |  Will never fly American Airlines again. After our vacation was cut short for two days because American Airlines cancelled our trip to Hawaii two hours before our flight was to take off. Which was 2am. Was told when I called to reschedule that most people cancel. Not when you have kids who have been waiting for year to go you don't. Then when getting a flight out the next day we were not assigned seats had to go to the counter at every stop to make sure we had seats. One flight they put my 11 yr old between two strangers. There was no food available when flying from Philadelphia to LA. Had a 7hr lay over in LA. No food available from LA to HI either. They will only compensate us with 200.00 vouchers that expires in a year. Oh also out 800.00 for hotel expenses due to arriving two days late. Will never fly American Airlines again.
1353,"  The worst airline I’ve ever been on. My flight was delayed three times on the way there, and twice on the way back. When we finally got onto the plane, we sat there for an entire hour until we started flying. On top of all of that, they lost my luggage. Complete trash."
1354,"  Denver to Gatwick via Orlando. Worst experience, will not do it again. I was flying unaccompanied with a toddler on this trip. I intentionally booked flights that had a couple layovers thinking it would give the baby the opportunity to get out and about to do something else on a long journey. These layovers is where all the trouble started. Flew from Denver to North Carolina and made the connection without a hitch. Then from North Carolina to Orlando before heading to London. My flight coming into Orlando arrived late. By the time I was able to de-board the plane my connection was boarding in another terminal, completely on the other side of the airport where I had to leave and re-enter security to get there. Since I was carrying a 30+ lb. Toddler and a 15+ lb carseat I tried to ask for help to get where I needed to go quickly. The gate agents response (at every stop) was it's faster just to do it yourself.  So nowI sprint across all of the Orlando airport get to security only to find the boarding passes they sent me for my British Airways connection don't work. Security tells me I have to go to the ticket counter to get new passes .my flight is boarding as we speak. I run to the ticket counter, loaded down with baby & her stuff to find no one at the counter. Talk to the American Airlines representative (flight is booked as american airlines, operated as british airways) to be informed they can't do anything they will have to see if there is someone around for British Airways. Find someone, get my boarding pass, make it through security get on the plane with 3 minutes to spare. Coming back was worse. Flight out of Florida was delayed 2 hours causing me to miss my connection. After flying 9 hours with a toddler, going through customs in and out of security and hauling around all the baby gear they wanted to put me on a connecting flight to get home the following moring! Finally found 1 gate agent who sympathized and managed to get me the last 2 seats on the last flight that night. However; when arriving for my connection in Dallas they changed the arrival gate to another terminal completely across the airport. Once again the connection was boarding, asked gate agents for help to get across the airport quickly and was told it was faster to do it myself. RAN with toddler and accessories across all of DFW. As a mother of 3, two who are now grown I remember gate agents and airport staff being much more helpful with families flying with young children. Apparently preboarding for parents flying with young children doesn't exist to this airline anymore. When I asked the rep almost laughed at me. It only makes sense so that parents can get kids settled and out of the way of other boarding passengers. Instead I got to stand in the isle, hold up traffic flow and apologize repeatedly to everyone around me while I tried to get the baby in. On the flight back from London to Florida (9 hours) the movies on my daughter TV didn't work and they couldn't do anything to fix it. I  could not get wifi to entertain her. The whole travel part of the trip was a complicated mess. On the other side my husband and older daughter where flying on another airline at the same time and arrived everywhere they where going early."
1355," Chicago to New York. After all the hassle with another airline flights being cancelled I managed to book myself on AA an flight from ORD to NWR. It was a ripoff but had no other alternative and paid 487 USD for a one way ticket. As if the drama of this particular night didn’t want to end, AA has added to the spice by delaying the 9.50pm until 11:50pm then till 12:30am. After we boarded the plane and ready to take off I saw the crew running around and suddenly they announced that this aircraft can’t fly tonight because it is scheduled for maintenance in the morning. Then we had to leave the plane and wait for a new aircraft. Finally there was a new plane came and we took off at 2:30am instead of 9:50pm the previous night. Finally landed in NYC at 5:30am totally exhausted and had to run for my important meeting at 8:30am. This was just a disaster. The plane was very old and dirty."
1356," Flew Bristol to Charlotte. As usual American Airlines did not disappoint, departed almost 2 1/2 hours late and got to sit on the tarmac for 45 minutes once we arrived in Charlotte. Congratulations American on being the world’s worst airline. I realize maintenance issues happen but if I pull my last four American flights I have had at least one leg disrupted with some sort of maintenance issue. Fix your planes."
1357,"  Cancun to Montreal via Philadelphia. Extremely bad experience. First, the flight from Philadelphia got delayed 15 minutes, to only get delayed another 30 later on. The flight attendants were extremely rude, actually only one of them, he was shouting commands at us while boarding the plane. The company does not provide inflight meals even though the number of hours ant time of the day would require so. This is by far the worst flight experience I had so far. Avoid this company!"
1358," Rome to Detroit via Philadelphia. I’ve had my share of bad travel experiences and it’s often I compelled me to write nasty reviews, so it’s only fair that when I have a really great experience I write a fitting review as well. Classic situation- our flight from Rome to Philadelphia (AA 719) was delayed for about two hours, which caused us to miss our connecting flight (with Dreaded Delta) from Philadelphia to our home in Detroit . Very rarely does this pan out in the travelers favor. Great customer service isn’t born by perfection; not every flight is on time, and mistakes are made. Great customer service is all about making it right. Like all travelers in this situation, I just wanted to get home and that’s exactly what happened. American ended up booking us on a full flight about an hour after our original flight into Detroit, causing minimal inconvenience. Free of charge. Technically speaking I think AA had no obligation to do this and that Delta, if anyone, would have issued us new tickets (and no, we did not have insurance). Beyond that, I have to say that the staff of flight AA 719 was the most professional, pleasant and fun crew I have been around over probably a hundred flights. Both the staff on the flight and the representatives I spoke to on the phone (especially supervisor Leslie) were extremely helpful and understanding of our situation. They had rules and protocol and they broke them to help us — they treated us like individuals and not like numbers. That is the hallmark of a class organization. Generally speaking, when I select flights I’m looking more for price and timing. In the future I’m going to lean towards American Airlines. We could very easily have missed our flight, bought new tickets, hotel accommodations, a last second extra day off work, etc — that happens to people every day. I am genuinely appreciative of American Airlines effort to spare us."
1359,"  Miami to San Francisco. Ridiculous! It’s 1 am and still at the airport in Miami! My flight to San Francisco was supposed to depart at 7:50 pm and the crew had us waiting for 2 hours in the plane while fixing Documents. The problem is that they didn’t keep us informed as to what was happening. Then we got sent to another aircraft because apparently the one we were originally didn’t pass the test when it should’ve been tested beforehand. While we are waiting on the second flight after 4 hours of waiting then the crew disappears and we have not pilot. I completely understand that incidents happen if it’s a weather condition, or even if there is something wrong with the aircraft. But, the fact that they staff kept lying to all passengers is not professional! My time is very valuable. Again very unprofessional from the company staff to not be transparent with the passengers."
1360,"Not Verified | Chicago to Jamaica via Charlotte. This airline is a joke. I'm not sure when they last took off on time. We flew from Chicago heading to Charlotte and after half an hour in the air the captain had to land back to Chicago due to a smell coming out of the AC. This caused connecting flights to be missed and took us more than 6 hours to catch a flight to Jamaica. On the way back, we had a 2 hour delay at Charlotte pushing the take off time to 1am without notifying customers that check points at CLT closes at 9:45pm. Yes, if your flight is late at night you have to check in before 9:45pm or otherwise you can't make it to the gate. We had to spend the night at a nearby hotel to catch the earliest flight which was also delayed after boarding due to maintenance. Worst experience ever."
1361,"  Chicago to Newark. Over 5 hour delay, poor communication, rude staff with apparently lack of information. Puppets we call them. Better equip and train your staff to communication and provide credible information to paying customers."
1362,"  Miami to Houston. I find it extremely unprofessional for an airline company to not be able to explain why a flight was delayed three different times. When asked at the front desk to speak to a representative or manager, the employees of American airlines gave extremely rude, non-hospital answers. If a passenger books a flight for hundreds of dollars to a destination, they should have the right to know exactly why a flight was delayed without attitude from American Airlines crew. It is the responsibility of the airline to provide factual answers to the customer who is spending several hundreds of dollars. If I could give this airline a -10 I would."
1363,"  Palm Springs to New York via Dallas, and was traveling first class with an emotional support 16 lb Cairn Terrier. I was asked to renew the AA form signed by my doctor 48 hours before the flight. I had been doing this for the last 4 years. I sent the completed form 3 days before the flight I got an email back saying they needed the date the therapist was licensed not the date it expired and the name of her business. I emailed back that she was in private practice and gave the date she was licensed. The day of my flight, I checked in for my flight and was asked for a copy of the service animal form, which I presented and was issued boarding passes, with a stopover in Dallas. When I got to Dallas and boarding the flight to NY with my dog, I was pulled aside and told I couldn't board the flight. Now I had my boarding pass, my suit cases were on the plane, and my little dog was in tow. I said ""What, you've got to be kidding?"". This very rude employee brusque told me he wanted to my paperwork, which I gave to him. He told me I couldn't board the flight because I needed a letter from my doctor with her letterhead and I didn't have it. I told him I was never asked for that, just the AA form. He said the only way I could board the flight was to pay $250. I said I would if this would help expedite and we could sort it out later. Then he told me then I would need a dog carrier to board the plane, which I didn't have as this wasn't required for emotional support animals. I told him this was not right, I had followed the online requirements and showed him my AA form and my emails with the SAC (Special Assistance Coordinator). I asked him to call his supervisor, which he did. All of this took about 30 minutes. Now the plane was fully boarded and he was not going to let me on this flight. Seconds before the flight left, finally his supervisor agreed I could get on the plane. The doors were now locked to the hallway and he couldn't open them, he was having a meltdown, until another employee who had the gate opener helped him out. I was literally overwhelmed and terrorized (create and maintain a state of extreme fear and distress in (someone); fill with terror.) The so called first class flight was horrendous, with a loud stewardess gossiping for 3hrs, we all heard every word and she couldn't even bring water. I had order a breakfast, got some crumby granola!"
1364,"Not Verified |  Dallas to Maui. The service in first class going over to Maui Hawaii was very good on June 15, 2018. However, the service coming back to DFW on June 23,2018 was very bad. I would say the people sitting coach had better service. I had a staff member that must hate her job because they acted as if it was a bother to answer any questions. The meal was very under par, I was served a vegetable dish that consisted of a plate of rice and 2 peas and 2 cubes of sweet potatoes. I will be rethinking my next flight with this airline again"
1365,"  On my way back home from Lima, the service was very bad. From Lima to Miami, their on board meal only included an omelet or a ham and cheese sandwich. We all ordered the omelet (a family of 5 people) since no one of us eats pork meat; however after the second bite I discovered that it has bacon in it. The flight attendants never mentioned that. I asked if they have any other options they denied with an attitude (I felt like they are doing me a favor even though I paid over $3000 for the trip). From Miami to Norfolk, I ordered a beer. The flight attendant served everybody but me. When I asked her again she pointed to my wife who she gave 2 beers and she said “there she got yours..” even though my wife ordered just for her. Later, I asked for another beer. The flight attendant claimed that they are out even though she listed many beer brands options to a guy was sitting right in front of me and she never served anymore after him (I knew this because the airplane was super small and the kitchen was right behind me). So technically the flight attendant never served me a thing for the whole time I was on board… (Very rude and unprofessional). Next time, I will make sure to fly with a different airline than this American Airlines. I believe that deserve some service with the money I pay."
1366,"  Worst staff ever! First off flying to a funeral, first flight landed 40 minutes late. Had to get 33 gates in 20 minutes, made it in 8 minutes just time to see our planes door closing. Total useless employee named made no attempt to get me on the plane. Informed me doors close 10 minutes prior to flight even when their airline was responsible. Instead made a disabled veteran go back 25 gates to customer service, who then booked my new flight 2 hours later 15 gates away. They could care less that I was disabled, going to a funeral, actually on time for the flight, anything. Everyone I dealt with was lazy and incompetent, that the best way I can describe them. First time and last time flying this pathetic excuse."
1367,"  Santa Ana to Phoenix. Poor communication. Changed the gate without an announcement. Then the flight was delayed to wait for a flight attendant to get to work. At least keep us informed, up to date, and not sitting in a plane for too long. We were clearly seen with dollar signs above our heads, and taken for granted. Just poor communication all around. As the very base level of customer service is communication. If you can’t handle that properly, the rest is diminished and meaningless."
1368,"Not Verified | Hands down this is the worst airline I have delt with. The staff was the rudest and most unprofessional. Our flight was from Phoenix to Fresno was cancelled, when we asked about our options the staff was rude and said we be put on stand by for the next flight which was later that night. We had children at home and our sitter was leaving the next day so we had to get home, so being put on stand by with 100 other people was not an option for us. So we rented a car and drove for 9 hours. When we emailed the airline (there is no phone number to call according to the staff) they said we ""elected"" to take a car and they would not reimburse us. The refund for the ticket didn't even cover the cost of the car (because it was from a different state). We tried calling the reservation hot line and the women we talked to stay we wasted their time by calling. She actually said we wasted her time. Please do not fly with them. They are rude and unprofessional and you might not even get where you need to."
1369,"  I have flown with American Airlines many times before and have never received such horrible customer service. My flight from Chicago O'Hare Airport to Wilmington, NC was delayed four times (which is not the problem). The flight was eventually cancelled, I have never had to deal with a cancelled flight before but I know it happens, so the staff should know how to handle these situations. I couldn't be more wrong. After standing in the customer service line for 40 minutes, I was handed a piece of paper with an 800 number on it, to then sit on hold for another hour, only to be told I would be issued a refund, or I could wait until the next day for a flight to my destination. I was traveling alone with my 7 Month old baby, and had only her diaper bag of limited supplies. The staff was absolutely useless, and very rude. One staff member rolled her eyes at me, and another man said to me, ""I can't control the airline, it's really not my problem."" I have never received such horrible customer service and this is absolutely unacceptable. I had to come up with different options for the staff to work with me, essentially doing their job. I ended up having to go through United Airlines to get to my destination, and their staff was very helpful. My family travels often, my husband is in the USMC, he and sometimes our whole family have to travel all over the US."
1370,"Not Verified |  Arrived at curbside check in at 5:30 am for a 6:43 departure (Tampa to Greensboro, via Charlotte. Then later that afternoon I was scheduled to leave Greensboro on a direct flight to Philadelphia and returning to Tampa the following day). Stand at curbside for ten minutes or so waiting for “computer problems” to be resolved so I can check my one bag. Finally gave up and went inside. Stood in that line for I guess another fifteen minutes or so because by the time it was my turn I was one minute ... yes, one minute inside the 45 minute cutoff to check a bag. What ensued over the next ten or fifteen minutes is not even worth going into, but suffice it to say that due to the ineptitude and uncaring of this “customer service representative” and his even more inept and uncaring supervisor, I missed a domestic flight I arrived an hour and fifteen minutes early for and was put on standby for the next one which was going to get me in an hour later than my first meeting was scheduled to start. While waiting on standby at the gate, I happened to start chatting with a girl sitting next to me, and turns out she is an AA employee’s daughter, and tells me somewhat sheepishly that it is AA policy to overbook every flight by at least five seats and their workaround is that any preferred status members who want on a flight can get on because they will work the system to get idiots like me who had the audacity to want to check a piece of luggage to “miss” their flight by milking the clock and then invoking FAA regulations. By some miracle, I did get on the standby flight, made it to Charlotte and on to Greensboro and went to baggage claim to get my bag. Guess what? No bag. A patently disinterested, gum-popping employee in the baggage office told me that my bag had been checked on to Philadelphia because “this isn’t where you are actually going.” Oh no? Then why am I here now? Too much in a hurry to worry about it, I left to get to what was left of my meetings and returned to the airport in Greensboro. With time in hand before my flight I decided to check and see if a different employee might have some other info about the bag containing my meeting clothes and other necessities for my meeting the following morning that I now hadn’t seen for almost twelve hours. This woman, who was actually nice enough, unlike everyone else I had dealt with so far, proceeded to tell me in about 0.2 seconds that yes, in fact, my bag was already in Philadelphia. The amazing part was that she hadn’t looked at my baggage claim ticket or touched her computer so I guess she was a psychic? Apparently a bad one, however, because when pressed she admitted she had no basis for that claim and decided maybe sne should call someone (never did say who or where) and double check, at which point she says that in fact my bag has very considerately been held here for me in Greensboro and will be joining me on the plane to Philadelphia. Super. Only guess what? I land in Philadelphia and there is no bag waiting for me there, so once again I head for the baggage office of AA. Luck happened to be with me this time and I happened to get helped by a wonderful person named Zakiyah who patiently worked to disentangle all of the lies, ineptitude and misinformation that had been dogging my poor little suitcase all day long and finally deduced that it had been taken off the plane and put on the wrong conveyor in another terminal and was revolving forlornly on a conveyor belt a few buildings over"
1371,"Not Verified |  Charlotte to Greenville. Most unreliable airline I have ever used. 9 out of 10 times that I have used American Airlines, there are multiple delays with no explanation and they will keep pushing back the departure times until they finally tell you the flight is cancelled. I will fly them only out of necessity. Don't bank you hopes of them to get you to your destination on time. It can be so frustrating flying with them."
1372,"  Corpus Christie to Harrisburg via Charlotte. I've had ""we don’t have a crew”, “we have the crew but no flight attendant and we don't know where she is"", storms are delaying flights through Charlotte leaving us with less available planes, we had a glitch in our computer, the cover to a tiny light no one could see or touch except the flight attendant (you would've had to get on the floor in center walkway and reach beside my seat which require a purposeful movement bc the arm and seat stuck out above it) is missing and we don’t have the part and we need the official part, storms delayed the incoming plane we were taking, and now the engines won't start. Seriously, whoever put the voodoo curse on me, I am ready to do what it takes to reverse it and now Harrisburg doesn’t accept flights past midnight. So we deplaned for the second time today.  And that doesn’t include the many other times we were told we were boarding only to be told we weren’t after waiting in line holding our luggage for long periods of time during all of last wed and today. Wasting an entire day both days continuing to say we were going only to not board when we could’ve arrived later and done something besides wait at an airport holding my luggage. The absolute worst airline I have flown in my life. The rage is literally boiling over. Im looking at day 3 of all day excuses for why American Airlines can’t manage to get a single airplane on time to their correct destination. I’ve used my own extra resources for extra rides to the airport to pick up luggage that was sent to the wrong airport and they couldn’t get in until the next day, for extra Lyft rides because of their continued incompetence. Delta was kind enough to give us care packages because of our lost luggage. American Airlines offered us nothing. No remorse or care in the world. "
1373,Not Verified |  Phoenix to Omaha. This company was absolutely amazing. My mom has cancer and was going thru a ton of pain but we made it to our original flight. Still in pain they had a wheel chair for her and got her on the plane first to make her comfortable.  When we got her off the plane they had a wheel chair for her and took us to baggage and even helped with getting her to the restroom. Both Phoenix and Omaha employees went over and beyond. I will use them always going forward.
1374,"Not Verified |  Philadelphia to Eria. I purchased tickets for my daughters to fly to Arizona to attend their grandfathers funeral. Everything was fine for the flight to Arizona, it's the return flight where the problems started. My daughters informed me there connecting flight from Philadelphia to Erie, PA had been cancelled due to excessive air traffic. When I called customer service to inquire what was going on I was greeted like this ""yeah this is Mike"". Seriously this is how a business has there customer service answer the phone. Customer service was no help at all and basically told me he could not do anything. Well so much for customer service. He wasn't outright rude but made me feel I was the idiot for calling to ask questions. Anyway my daughters asked at the airport what was going on and were told they would need to find a hotel for the night since their connecting flight was cancelled. No reason just cancelled. I read a bunch of these reviews and have come to the conclusion that it doesn't matter what I write no one at American Airlines is going to read this or care. They got their money and that's all that matters. I will never book another flight with them even if it's free. This company is a joke."
1375,"  We were in Dallas Fort Worth Airport, arriving from Spokane. We walked over to our gate an hour prior to the boarding time. We remained there until 7:20AM when the plane was scheduled to board. The announcer came on for the gate. ""Sorry, folks. If you were going to board this flight to Kansas City, it is now cancelled. Feel free to call customer service or come up to this desk to be moved to a stand by list for another flight."" I looked at my wife questioningly. Had they really just said that? I looked at the crowd of people now hopping to their feet. We spent the day rushing from gate to gate trying to catch flights on a standby list with sixty other people from a cancelled flight. Why hadn't they just waited for another plane and delayed our flight two hours instead of having us run from gate to gate trying vainly to catch flights that were always overbooked? As we waited we heard stories of other cancellations, horrendous customer service, and an overall lack of any sympathy from American Airlines for the trouble they were causing their customers. ""I'm not going to book with American Airlines again."" I told my wife. She agreed that we should try to avoid it. On our way back to Spokane our plane was delayed two hours without explanation. ""Our plane has just landed and is unloading now."" the gate attendant announced to us, half an hour prior to scheduled boarding. Three and a half hours later we finally got on the plane. We were in the last group to board and we sat in a stationary plane for another half hour before it moved at all. American Airlines  handled the problems they were facing in a way that was not reasonable for the customers that were relying on their services. American Airlines policies place their customers in troubling situations repeatedly. T"
1376,"  Worst travel experience ever. Our flight was delayed 3 hours both going & coming home for “mechanical issues”. Due to the delay in our return flight, we missed our connecting flight home which was in first class (arrived around midnight). They rebooked is the following morning at 5:45 AM in economy, gave us a voucher to a cheesy Holiday Inn Hotel (worst I’ve stayed in in awhile), & gave us a couple vouchers for breakfast & dinner. We had time today grab a quick bite downstairs in the hotel, shower, & rest for an hour before heading back to the airport. They don’t open their bag checking places until after 4:00 AM even though their sign says opening at 4:00. We finally get home & then waited almost an hour for our bags to be put on carousel. Unacceptable, AA! Completely unacceptable."
1377,"  Miami to Baltimore. Worst customer service ever. I lost my flight after asking 3 employees to help me check in time due to the line size, which was due to cancelled flights. All of them not only refused to help, but were sarcastic and rude. Then couldn’t make to the next flight because it was full and AA wanted me to pay to reschedule for the next day or just stay another 8 hours waiting for the stand by again. Absurd customer service and policies."
1378,"  New York JFK to Charlotte. The customer service for this airline was unspeakable, I tried to speak to the supervisor at the time to see why I was not able to attend the flight I paid for, and she disrespectfully said ""I already told you whats going on with your flight"" however I did not speak of my flight to her before. Apart from the fact that she spoke to me in a very disrespectful manner, she also attended another group of 30 while she was helping me out. I also overheard one of the guys working in the counter telling a customer that the flight was already packed, so I am assuming that the reason why they were not letting me attend my flight was be cause my flight was oversold. On the other hand I was getting multiple different reasons why i was not able to attend, because I called the airline and they told me my carryon was too big."
1379,"Not Verified |  Miami to Minneapolis. This was my first and last time flying American Airlines. I was scheduled to depart from MIA Friday at 5:40pm to land in Charolette where I then had a direct flight back to MSP. My scheduled arrival time in MSP was 12:20am Saturday. We started the boarding process where group 1 was starting to board. Then an announcement was made that there was a flat tire on the plane and they needed an hour to replace the tire. Half hour later we had a weather delay, no big deal its weather not their fault. After the weather cleared the work on the tire never started and another announcement was made that they needed an hour to fix the tire. These series of delays caused connection issues with other travelers and my connection was now in jepordy. After the repairs were made and driving around on the runway we finally departed at 9:40pm. We landed in Charolette around 1045pm, my flight to MSP left 20 min before I landed. After talking with an employee about needing to get home I had to spend the night in a questionable hotel that American Airlines paid for and gave me a $12 meal voucher. I arrived at the hotel at 12:30am (Same time I should have landed back home). Instead of having a direct flight from CLT to MSP I had to fly to ORD at 9:40am then land at MSP by 3:05pm. No issues flying to ORD (I was shocked), but now another issue with the plane. After the plane arrived from Las Vegas we started boarding again by calling group 1 then announcing we had to delay because of fluid leaking in the engine. Another delay of 1 hour. The announced that the plane had to be decommissioned and a new plane had to be brought in as a replacement. We finally took off from ORD around 3pm (Again the same time I should have been home). All the delays and setbacks caused my fees in the parking ramp to skyrocket. My overall experience with American Airlines was horrible. I have never been part of so many delays and questioned the overall safety of planes by one fleet. If a plane landed that had fluid leaking in an engine shouldn't that have set off an alarm? Why would they try and board knowing there was an issue on the plane? Also the on flight entertainment is the same level as Spirit airlines, there is none. Only if you want to burn through you phone battery which is an extremely valuable resource when flying American Airlines and can't call your family to tell them you are delayed...again. Overall I would pay extra money to fly a different airlines."
1380,  American canceled my flight and I had to call to reschedule with a responsible airline like Delta. Then on trip back trip delayed 2 hours so I was on the airport for a total of 6 hours with two kids. No consideration to customers. Would not recommend American airlines to anyone.
1381,"  Tampa to Nashville via Charlotte. First and foremost when I booked my flight, I booked it so I would leave out of my home city Sarasota/Bradenton. I was to leave at 5:00 on a Friday morning. At 10:30 p.m. on Thursday I get a text that my flight has been cancelled. Of course I immediately call AA and am told it will take one and half to two hours before I even get a return call. I wait for about an hour and try again. Rather than giving me the call back option this time, they recognize my number and ask me to hold. I do so for about 45 minutes. Eventually I get a customer service representative and my only option is to fly out of Tampa airport the next morning. They initially had me rebooked on a 10:30 a.m. Flight from Tampa but by the time I got into Nashville and then drove two hours to where my daughter lives, all of Friday would have been wasted. So I rebooked on a 5:00 a.m. Flight, getting into Nashville at the same time I would have if my Sarasota flight hadn't been cancelled. By this time it's 1:00 or so in the morning. That leaves me about an hour's worth of sleeping time before I have to get up and leave for the Tampa airport. While I made the flight on time and the customer service representative was very helpful in getting me on that flight, the fact remains I had to drive an hour to the airport and park my car whereas if I had left from Sarasota like I normally do, I would have used Uber and not incurred $90 in parking fees (plus two hours of driving time and tolls). American Airlines refuses to reimburse me. If I had missed my flight you can be sure I wouldn't have gotten a refund or any other courtesy. All I want is a refund of the parking fees. That's not too much to ask."
1382,"  Our first flight was delayed twice because of another flight. They didn't bother trying to get another plan for us, they just delayed it. In mid shift we are told we have to land in Dallas due to weather. Since this was a weather cancellation they do not offer any compensation or accommodations. Unfortunately I have severe anxiety and fly with an emotional support animal. I showed them it would only cost $100 to book me a rental (by the way it is now after midnight and our fly was originally scheduled to land at 10pm) versus the 300-700 for a flight in the morning. The service reps at all of the kiosks could Not figure out how to reboot anyone and all of them were extremely rude. There was no empathy. I asked for a supervisor who showed up 15 minutes later and ignored me! Finally I called in and was treated the same way. Needless to say any future flights I book will not be with American."
1383,  Syracuse to Denver. Worst experience ever.  They should not be allowed to stay in business. If any other business in America treated their customers like I was treated today they would be out of business. Don't fly American airlines or especially their regional PSA. 
1384,"  Baltimore to Miami. We have had to sit on the runway for over an hour and climbing after being told by the captain it would be 10 minutes outside the gate with zero ability to enter the airport, the airline is completely disorganized when it comes to weather. The passengers are super frustrated and the airline has no solution for departing the passengers. This is a horrible way to spend a Friday evening when people are going to a tourist destination like Miami and then caged up because there are no solution minded people at the airport who are capable of Moving empty planes from gates to depart paying passengers in order to save money on gas. Really awful- and all at the customers expense."
1385," AA got me to Europe and back to the US safely. That is about all I can say that's positive. I have flown this airline for over 30 years and they seem to be going downhill in on-time departures, comfort, and service. On my trip from DFW to Paris and the return from Rome, the service was the most apparently lacking. On the outbound they kept announcing another 30 minute delay(mechanical problem in the interior) every half hour for a total 3 hour delay. The ground crew was heard saying they did not have enough maintenance people working on a Sunday afternoon. The dinner service once onboard was rushed and unpleasant and I chalked it up to the late take off. Not so, because the service from the flight attendants on the return trip was just as shabby. FA were unfriendly, unhelpful, and at times rude or condescending towards passengers. They acted as if they did not want to be there doing this job.  I was in the new Premium Economy cabin and paid a lot more than an economy fare for my ticket. I feel the higher cost should include better service, not just a bigger seat. The new Premium Economy passengers had to go sometimes to the very back of the plane and through the galley to use a vacant lavatory. Forget stretching your legs on a long flight by walking to the back as the aisles are so narrow in the Main Cabin one can not avoid bumping seated passengers.There was no offer of refills on the free alcohol drinks. Any question or request was met with an attitude that the FA could not be bothered. I could see that this job may not be the most glamorous, but if you can't or won't do the job, then retire so that someone with a better attitude could take your place. Or maybe you should take a desk job at American. "
1386,"Not Verified |  Worst experience of my life. If you have been to El Paso, TX you know how small this airport is. I’ve been flying International for years with Delta and United Airlines, never had an issue arriving 90 min prior. We arrived at 5am for our 6.30 flight, the line was at end of the opposite side of the airport (only airline that had any line) they had 7 different airplanes leaving within minutes of each other. We finally get to the front, our attendant is assisting another attendant who is having a hard time explaining to another customer about their cat boarding, took another 10 minutes to assist us, finally gets to us “sorry they’ve closed the check in 5 minutes ago”. They rebooked for the next day with a 6 hour lay over in Dallas. I’ve been on hold for 50 minutes now (and counting) to try to get fly us one day after our scheduled back date. Horrible, horrible, horrible!"
1387," American Airlines changed its terminal at LGA. A gates are now at the B terminal. I arrived at the A terminal and had to get to the B terminal quickly. I arrived at my gate just as the doors had shut, and while the airplane sat there for 20 minutes, a rude stewardess told me repeatedly ""ma’am there’s nothing I can do"". When one of her colleagues tried to help me she told her not to. I was boarded on a flight two hours later which left 20 minutes late because they were waiting for late passengers. Unbelievable. Just a case of a small person playing king in the castle."
1388," I am sitting on the plane right now at 9.20 am and was supposed to depart at 8.40 am. One announcement was made by a pilot stating ""we will depart shortly"" about 5 minutes after I made a comment to the attendant about the lack of communication to the passengers. It is absurd I have had nothing but problems with American Airlines this week. I surely will not recommend American to anyone."
1389, Florence to Seattle via Charlotte. I am highly disappointed in American this morning. Had a 5:50 am flight out of Florence and right in the middle of boarding they cancel our flight which caused me to miss my connecting flight to Seattle. The inconsiderate way the staff handle it made it even worse basically saying you either drive to CLT or they will provide Uber to but won’t assure that we will miss the new flight that was scheduled. Needless to say I miss the another flight en route and get here having to go through TSA once again then sent back to even more difficult customer service reps was a nightmare. Getting told my 4pm flight may be oversold etc and there isn’t another flight until much later or even tomorrow has me so upset I can cry. I don’t usually complain being that I fly out 2 to 3 times a month and understand things happen but maintenance issues or crew issues are solely under the control of American Airlines how they handle these conditions are primarily left up to staff and reflects their company. But these people so rude and just don’t care I think I’ll be going back to Delta after this one
1390,"  I booked a flight on American Airlines flying out on June 15 to see my mother for the last time she was placed in hospice. I showed up to the airport in plenty of time only to find out that my flight was delayed after waiting for about an hour after the original take off time I was told the flight was canceled. Employees at the desk said that I could wait for the next flight which flew out the next day or I could rent a rental car and be reimbursed for the cost of the rental car. I decided since time is of the essence and my mom was not doing well that I would Drive eight hours from North Carolina to Alabama to be with her. After driving all night and not getting any sleep I got to Alabama around six in the morning and spent my mothers final hours with her before she passed that evening. When we woke up on Sunday, June 17 my wife could not find my flight record anywhere. After spending an hour and a half on the phone waiting for a customer service rep she got disconnected called back and left a callback number which took over two hours and finally got the flight rebooked. Around 4 PM we got an update from the American airline app saying the flight had once again been canceled my wife got back on the phone and was able to reschedule my flight through Delta putting me home around 2 AM. Now we are trying to get A refund issued on a flight we paid insurance for but have called customer service numerous times tried to use the website to find out how to get a refund and it keeps saying the flight was not canceled but I canceled the flight with the customer service reps at the airport. The amount of hassle and time and money that we have had to spend has been ridiculous especially having to deal with this with the death of my mother. The rental car that I got cost me over $500 with the rental and gas and I’m finding out it’s going to take a long time to get that money refunded. No one should have to wait on the phone for upwards of 5 to 6 hours altogether in the matter of two days and not have any resolution as far as how to cancel flights get refunds or get any help at all. The hoops we have had to jump through just to make sure I made it to my mothers and home when I needed to be had been exhausting and is making an already hard and stressful situation harder. All we are asking for is a refund of the rental car and flight I couldn’t take due to the airline canceling the flight originally but the airline is telling us they will not refund the car because the employee at the airline did not record it, we will only be refunded around $76 for the leg of the flight that was cancelled when the flight cost $484 so half of that should be refunded and are only going to give us a $300 flight voucher when we never fly so we will not use the flight voucher."
1391,"  Philadelphia to Athens. I have realised that US airlines are in no way near any of the european or other international airlines in terms of in flight service and quality. Especially with American Airlines  an airline that I have used time and again, only in order to avoid transit airports, this can be the only choice for a direct flight to Athens from Philly. The Airbus aircraft was perfect and the flight was very good with minor turbulence however somehow I felt unhappy with cabin staff with the exception of a greek speaking steward. Dinner was below average for such a long flight, (10 hours) and so was the miserable ""breakfast"" just before landing. Hardly did cabin staff ever pass to collect garbage and once when I complained, the guy looked at me as if he wanted to kill me. Courtesy is almost unknown. Likewise the situation in the toilets was beyond any description."
1392,"Not Verified |  Cleveland to Charlotte. Customer service was absolutely horrible, arguing with other members in front of customers, didn’t apologize, flight was over booked. Was given a choice. Either get rebooked to a later flight with no forewarning or take your chances and if you can’t get in tough luck? That’s not how business works and I wasn’t accommodated for anything. I’ll never fly American again that’s a fact. Work on your customer service and employee screenings. It's not the customer's job to figure it out if I want take a chance on getting on a flight."
1393," Baltimore to Minneapolis via Charlotte. I was enjoying my first time flying first class until I reached my layover in Charlotte and found my connecting flight to be delayed - as if my layover wasn't already long enough. I try to go to customer service to rebook and the line is way down the terminal. Then I call customer service on the phone but was disconnected because of the high call volume. I look at the departures going to MSP to see an earlier departure that I was willing to pay $70 to jump on, but was denied because I checked baggage in Baltimore. This delay has caused so much inconvenience. You would think AA would take care of their loyalty members. I have another trip booked with them next Monday and I think after that it's to start considering other options."
1394,"Not Verified |  Dallas to Lubbock. For years I have turned a blind eye with the many small problems of the airline: comfortless, no food, delays, and so on. However, my last flight was too much. They cancelled a flight with no reason given (the weather was excellent in all the route). I was told to call a hotel (Motel 6 DFW North) to pick me up for the night, but they never came. Then, I called American Airlines's customer service but the person answering refused to help me with calling the hotel. At the end, I was left the whole night at the airport. By the way, I had purchased insurance and it was not honored. I am just giving two stars because a manager in the morning kindly helped reprogramming my flight."
1395,"  Our flight this evening was delayed 4 times over 3 hours due to bad weather in Chicago. At 9pm we were informed that our flight had been rescheduled for 9:30am the next morning. I understand you can't control the weather, but by this time there were no other flights leaving Raleigh (or the surrounding area) until at least 7am the next morning. I had an important event to attend in Chicago the next morning. When I approached the agent you could tell right away that she didn't care. I tried to find an earlier flight from a nearby area or even just one that got me close to Illinois. I offered to drive from Raleigh part way to catch a flight or even drive from outside Chicago a couple hours...if she could just get me close. The response I received was that my request was too difficult and required too much work on her part. I then asked if there was someone else who could help me and she said I was free to go wait in line again for someone else who might be more willing to spend the time assisting me in getting to my destination. (point to note: there was no one behind me in line) I was frustrated and started to break down into tears (that's how important this event was) but all she did was pick at her nail polish and repeat the phrase 'you will not be making it to Chicago by tomorrow morning.' She then proceeded to tell me that I was not eligible for a hotel voucher because I was not based out of Raleigh? Well played. I travel a decent amount and have a lot of patience for people dealing with travel issues. Travel delays happen and I accommodate, but this time I really needed to get somewhere and American Airlines missed the mark. The least she could have done is shown a little compassion but no, I was treated like I was there to serve her needs as she saw fit. Would it have been so hard for her to ask someone else to help me? Apparently the purchase of a ticket from American Airlines doesn't include basic kindness for the ticket holder. Maybe you have to pay extra for that?"
1396,"Not Verified |  I got bumped off a flight last year because they decided to change to a smaller plane. I received a voucher for my 6 hour stay in the Pheonix airport. Fast forward to today and me trying to use said voucher. You have to book 2 weeks in advance and mail the voucher in. A hassle I am sure is used to deter use. My issue is however trying to get through to customer service to book a flight. I have attempted a dozen times today. Twice I have been put on the ""we will call you back queue"" which said was 8-10 minutes. Both times I have not received a call. Completely worthless. This has been a 4 hour effort so far and I have spoken to no one. After the use of these vouchers I am done with American."
1397,"Not Verified |  Columbus to Charlotte. Customer service was horrible. Traveled with my toddler and had little to no help with guidance and questions. All of the workers had very bad attitudes and made my daughter and I very uncomfortable. Never will fly with them again, I thought frontier was bad but I had the worst experience of my life yesterday with American Airlines. and our flight got delayed a couple of times."
1398,"Not Verified |  Baltimore to Boise. Absolutely terrible. First flight was delayed for over an hour so we missed our connecting flight, so we also missed our Grandfathers funeral viewing. Was supposed to go from BWI to Phoenix. Got stuck in Pheonix had to go to Salt Lake City then Boise What should have been 8 hours turned into 16. Then they lost our luggage, and thats just getting to our destination. Trying to get home our plane was delayed once again missed our connecting flight got stuck in Arizona overnight. Didn't offer food or a hotel had to pay out of pocket. Then we have another flight the next morning - canceled. Then we get a flight to Chicago where we found out our new connecting flight we were not booked. Staff at Chicago O'Hare was incredibly rude. Like unbelievably. I want someone to do their job I'm paying you to do it. If they cant do their job find someone who can. I'm not paying thousands of dollars for this poor service. Still in Chicago hope they dont screw up the last flight. But they have not impressed me so far."
1399,  American Airlines does not accommodate to their delays and issues. We were scheduled to come home at 7:44am from jackson hole with a layover in Dallas and then land in Austin at 1:38pm needless to say I paid extra money for this flight for the short trip time. We got a notification the night before that our flight would be delayed till 11:30am and we had to switch our connecting flight and us land in Austin after 5pm. It wasn’t even 30 min before flight was supposed to board that they tell us oh no you won’t be departing till 8:20pm! I am pregnant with twins now having to sit in the airport for 8 hours. I went up to the counter to ask if there was any way to get us home sooner that I was pregnant with twins and in need of getting home sooner because have a doctors appointment and the lady was so rude said ma’am I can’t help you go sit down. The people working the counter of American Airlines did not tell us we had to go back out to get our bags then go through the line again to check them we all had to figure that out so when others were saying that’s what we had to do I went to the counter to ask and the man told me “the bags arnt going to check themselves” are you kidding me? Then I over heard how some ladies got food vouchers which we did not. So I had to go to front desk and they sent me on wild goose chase for the vouchers with a whole whopping $24 for two people! After I got the vouchers I had to go back through security once again. This has been the worst experience I have ever had with any airline and I refuse to ever fly with them again and I suggest to anyone taking the time to read this to not fly with them they are the most inconvenient airline ever and do not make adjustments to their delays or issues. I just had signed up to be a AAdvantage member and I cannot cancel that soon enough.
1400,"Not Verified |  Took a trip to London and the service on the flight back to DFW was terrible, even though the ride itself and the inflight entertainment were fine. Flight attendants were rude, disinterested, and seemed like they hated being there. As I went to the back of the plane often to stretch my legs, I would hear the flight attendants saying nasty things about passengers. They hardly paid any attention to the passengers except what they were absolutely required to do, spending much of their time gossiping and goofing off in the back. I flew British Airways on the way there and the contrast is astounding. BA is far more professional and courteous to their passengers. Then once in DFW to make a connection, I spoke with two attendants at check-in desks and both were unhelpful and rude. I asked one guy if there was room on an earlier flight and to avoid checking he told me it would cost $100 to change flights (not what I asked). Then I was trying to help a lady who missed her connection, as the plane was still at the gate, and the attendant basically just said “too bad” and didn’t offer to help her get on a different flight or anything even though it was AA’s fault she missed her connection. American Airlines is a terrible airline and if I could avoid flying with them I would."
1401,Not Verified |  Flew American Airlines from Fargo to Newark via Chicago. Honestly just a terrible airline and rude people too. My bag clearly fit into that “overhead” sign that they keep at every desk and I was still forced to check my bag for a fee of course. Money grubbing rude people who don’t care about their passengers. Would give all zeros if this system let me.
1402,Not Verified |  My wife and I on our 26 year anniversary had purchased tickets over year ago sitting next to each other. When we check in advised out seats were not together. Asked the stewardess why she said she would check never came back. This is usual with American Airlines. Back a few years had flight from Vegas that was delayed twice on the tarmac for maintenance reasons. Advised stewardess we had a connecting flight at Charlotte we would be close to missing. She said don't worry we will be first off plane. Well she lied and when I asked her as we were getting off flight she shrugged shoulders and did bit answer. We ran to connecting flight to have the door shut in our face and told we would have to get another flight. We did and 24 hours later finally arrive at Gainesville to having my luggage lost. Once luggage was found my new suitcase (first time use) was shredded. I was offer nothing for the damage. This will be the last time I fly American.
1403,"Not Verified |  Chicago to Orlando. My family will never be using American Airlines again. First off, we get to the airport and everyone has bags that meet the 22x14x9 guidelines, in fact 2 of the 3 bags were under that. We had to pay $25 extra per bag for 2 of them because they were the small wheely bags instead of duffel bags. There was a woman working who was very unhelpful and rude and the other staff was just standing around when the kiosk wasn't working to get our tickets. On my sister's return flight, they charged $50 for her bag and there was ample room for it under the seat. She doesn't even carrying a purse so this was literally all she had. We still have 2 return flights on Tuesday, but I am sure there will be some fiasco since American Airlines seems to hide their fees and guidelines everywhere! I would definitely not recommend this airline."
1404,"Not Verified |  New York JFK to Milan. I'll start by saying that the flight itself was smooth. Aside from that, the flying experience with this airline was terrible. Sadly, I had a seat in cattle class for which I paid $60 extra just to reserve with no obvious benefit. American has now crammed 9 seats into what was clearly meant to be an 8 seat row. The seats themselves are significantly narrower and flimsy. To say the seats are uncomfortable is an understatement. And this was a transatlantic flight. The food was barely edible, came with terrible plastic utensils and was basically thrown at us. Service was totally disinterested. Having flown economy class on Lufthansa last year, the whole experience was shocking. Never, never again. American airlines should be ashamed."
1405," Never ever again will I fly this company. I fly at least 4 times a year and it was my second time using American Airlines. The first one was a nightmare, well the second was even worse. Now I will pay any money to avoid this company. They delay flights every time without an explanation, service is not friendly, we had an emergency landing and got home 6 (!) hours later than planned. And they don’t even apologize. Absolutely the worst company."
1406," Horrible experience and no customer service. My daughter flew to go to school oversees on a flight operated by American Airlines. The baggage claim ticket stated AA, but when she arrived at her destination, they would not help even though her luggage was lost on the AA leg of the flight. They would accept no responsibility, instead blaming the last leg of the flight which was with Iberia. Iberia will not respond at all about reimbursing expenses and AA will not offer any assistance. My daughter was in a foreign country without her luggage for 9 days. I called AA 3 times and they could not care less. They do not care about their customers and will do nothing to help you if you have an issue. Worst customer service ever!"
1407," They don’t really care about customer relations. I have seen several times that they overbook the flights when seriously, with advent of technology, it can clearly be avoided. They don’t even have enough staff at airports to run things smoothly. Let me tell you what I went through: 1) First my flight from Cedar Rapids to Chicago was delayed by 3 hours. You know how far Chicago is from Cedar Rapids? Just 30 minutes if we go by air. This has happened to me twice. You know airlines from other countries are carrying passengers on their transatlantic flights without delays, cancellations and excellent customer service. Its about time they visit those countries and take a lesson on how to provide a valuable customer service. 2) Then, they let everyone board the plane but somehow manage to find an excuse to not take off. We had to wait for take-off on tarmac for 2 hours and on top of that, the pilot doesn’t even announce periodically what is going on. This was agonizing for so many passengers. I purposely selected this flight because I had a 3 hour layover in Chicago and I was going to meet my friend, but because of delays caused by American Airlines, I will have to wait for another couple of months. Don’t even tell me it was a weather related delay as it was sunny! They clearly either didn’t have pilots or planes to provide the service and yet, booked us knowing very well that their services were not adequate in any way. I reached Chicago Airport at 5.30 pm when I was supposed to arrive there around 2.30 pm. But this was just the beginning. 3) Then while waiting for my next plane out of Chicago to Newark, they very cleverly increased the delay by 15-20 minutes at one time so that customers don’t cancel with them and fly with any other airlines because when you incrementally delay flights by 15 minutes, customers are more likely to stay with that particular airline in order to reach their destination. Whereas, if you had displayed from the beginning that it was 2-3 hours delay, customers were more likely to look for other options to reach their destination. 4) Then we boarded the plane at 8.30 pm, 2.5 hours after scheduled time and the same thing happened. We were on the runway for the next 2.5 hours. 2.5 hours! For what? No one knows. Crew failed to provide any update. There was no weather delays again. After 2.5 hours, the pilot turned the plane back to gate telling that he has completed his hours and couldn’t fly. Tell me about commitment levels displayed by American Airlines. Clearly, there is nothing American about your airlines anymore. 5) Then, I was told bags will arrive at carousel 6 and they arrived at carousel 7 instead. Ground staff in baggage claim area didn’t even have a clue that my flight was cancelled. When I asked about where was my bag, I gave him my bag ticket and he was said “what was texture of your bag, what color was your bag”? What sort of ridiculous questions were they? 7) Now, I had to skip my whole day at work. Horrible!"
1408,  My sister and I scheduled a flight together and paid extra to claim seats next to each other. Her flight was canceled completely until the next day. We are returning from our trip and her flight and my flight are delayed. Our connecting flight was delayed. Her previous trip was delayed last time she took AA. Don’t take this airline.  I went to the desk for help in DFW and the lady didn’t acknowledge my presence.  I bought WiFi for $10/an hour and it took 3-5 min per click to download. Never an apology from anyone for the delays.
1409,"  Jacksonville to New York via Charlotte. Sleeping at CLT: How a flight crew laid waste our $4105.29 AA Vacation family weekend in New York. First, when I wrote my review of our AA Vacations Westin La Paloma trip in April, I didn't think that experience could be worsted (opposite of bested), so I didn't expect to be writing about another superlatively bad AA Vacation again, at least not so soon. I was wrong. The moral of this story is if you value the welfare of your family, your time and your money, don't rely on AA Vacations. But I've gotten ahead of myself. Here's our story. Things went beautifully on the first leg of what was to have been a fun family weekend in NY to celebrate the end of our son's school year. We sped through TSA pre, were greeted courteously at the gate and took our assigned seats in first class on AA1937. After a pleasant short flight to Charlotte, we connected to AA1981 bound for LaGuardia. When that flight didn't push away on time, the captain announced from the flight deck that a ""minor technical issue"" would hold us up briefly. I followed a running text stream of delay notices from AA on my phone. Then I received the dreaded notice of cancellation. Oddly, the flight crew were still telling us that the “technical issue” was in the process of being fixed. Specifically, the pilot advised that the copilot had flown too many hours to legally make the trip to NY and AA was on the hunt for a replacement. When I told the cabin attendant that the flight had been cancelled, she passed the news to the captain who, nonplussed, announced that ""apparently American Airlines notifies passengers of cancellations before telling its crew."" We were advised to deplane and come back at 7:00 a.m. the following day. I immediately called AA Vacations who had booked as part of our package non-refundable tickets for activities and events on Saturday. I got a terrific agent named Kristen who nimbly booked us on a flight to Newark. She even kept our first-class status! All we had to do was run the mile from the end of terminal C to the end of terminal B before the flight's scheduled 10:00 departure. We needn't have run. The flight to Newark was delayed due to a mechanical. First 11:00, then 12:00, then vouchers to Starbucks, then 1:00, then first class boarded, then we were told to deplane, then 2:00; and then it was cancelled. The gate agent, a terrific woman with a superman pin affixed to her purse, explained sincerely sympathetically that because NASCAR was in town there were no hotel rooms left in Charlotte. Like Tom Hanks in The Terminal we were to live in the airport for the night. No options. We dragged ourselves back to gate C19, the assigned departure gate for AA9200, boarding at 6:30 a.m. on Saturday. We were heartened to see an airplane already parked there. With nothing to eat, no place to sleep and no cardboard boxes, we were all newly sympathetic to street people. We put as cheerful a face on the five hour night as we could. When boarding time came, we didn't board. The plane that had been sitting at gate C19, on which we had hung the night's hopes was ""the wrong size."" Yes, the gate agent said he had been given an airplane ""the wrong size"" for the number of passengers booked. I could feel the crowd of passengers working itself into a mob. Since most like us had been bumped from the CLT/LGA and CLT/EWR flights the night before, I could well sympathize."
1410," I purchased tickets Mar. 17 which had us flying out of PDX and arriving in Cozumel the same day. In Sept. 17, I received an email that AA changed our reservations. It seemed fine since it was a shorter travel time than the original tickets. The a.m. of the flight we arrived to check in at PDX, and during the self-check in, we got a priority slip. We took it to the ticket counter and learned that when AA changed our flights, they did not allow their own “mandatory” 50 minutes for the connection flight. As such, they refused to allow us to catch our connection from DFW to CZM. Keep in mind that this was their mandatory layover time and they made the change that didn’t conform to it! AA was unable to locate a flight that would get us into Cozumel the same day, so we were forced to incur an overnight layover at DFW. To add insult to injury, each leg of each flight they were challenged to allow me and my fiancé sit together. We would have to pay at the ticket gate to move seats. Um, we purchased our tickets at the same time, is it too far of a stretch to consider we might want to sit together! So, for four flights we had to take extra time to “sweet talk” the gate agent into letting us sit together. Unbelievable! Due to the layover resulting from AA’s error, we were forced to incur additional hotel and meal costs, spend time rearranging transfers, contacting the hotel, etc., lost an entire day of vacation time/pay, lost our all-inclusive charges and hotel charge from the hotel in Cozumel, stressed out having to pick up the pieces because of AA’s mistake, and now I’m getting the pleasure of fighting with AA since they are only offering is a $250 flight voucher for each of us. That doesn’t come close to compensating for the time, money, and trouble they caused. And actually, at this point, I wish I were fighting with them. They’ve gone incommunicado. Won’t call when they say they will, won’t return calls. and, who would want vouchers from this joke of an airline? The only silver lining was the accommodating flight attendants. Otherwise, this company ought to be ashamed of themselves. Based on my research, this isn’t a one off."
1411,"  The staff at the gate was by far the worst I have encountered in my life. After making an announcement over the PA system that bags could be checked complementary, I walked up to do so. We had 2 bags that we weren't going to need thru the flight, plus our back packs. She looked us up and proceeded to become incredibly rude and told us that we had to empty our carry ons and try to cram everything into our backpacks and throw away our brand new carry-on luggage, or pay $210 to check them. After making the announcement that they would check them complementary. She was not helpful, made my daughter cry because we had to choose if what personal items to keep or throw away. We're moving cross country and have downsized to the point that it fit into our luggage, and now forced to throw away extremely sentimental items and look like fools and spoken to like preschoolers."
1412,"Not Verified |  Harrisburg to Philadelphia. This was the worst experience my husband and I have ever had with an airline. There were consistent delays which then caused issues for us to get to our connecting flight in Philadelphia which was the only flight to Athens. We were given incorrect information by the ticketing department on the phone, which then led us to drive the entire way to Philadelphia. We have spent hours trying to figure out a way to be compensated and they have the worst customer service! We will never use American Airlines again and be sure to make our family and friends aware of the issues they have caused us."
1413,  Don’t fly this airline if you check in bags. A frequent business traveler flying American for many years up until now. 50% of the times I check in bags they are broken into. These are locked and usally broken into in Dallas. Complained for many years got money back for stolen articles but nothing has changed. American can’t seem to fix the problem. This is my last American flight because I can’t depend on their security.
1414,"Not Verified |  Chicago to Rome. American Airlines, never again to be used on a Transatlantic flight. My partner and I traveled from Chicago to Rome on April 8 and even though I was charged almost $200 more to just be seated together on the only few two seaters available on this flight, it turned out to be the trip from purgatory. The FA kept hitting my shoulder all night long as she was walking back and forth down the aisle. I asked if they had a self service cart with juice/water and snacks in the back galley like most civilized airlines do and the told me it was not the case on this flight. The meal was really average nothing to scream alleluia about. I will truly go out of my way to avoid this company when flying overseas. Why do they call this aircraft the Dreamliner? Perhaps if you travel in First or Business - not so in regular economy. Very disappointed indeed."
1415,"  Worst flying experience I’ve had. First flight was delayed an hour, and instead of accommodating everyone right there, everyone was promised that they would make their connecting flights. Half the plane didn’t. They were just being lazy and didn’t want to provide customer service. I had to wait until I got to Charlotte to reschedule my flight, because of their delay in Montego Bay. I’m 12th in line on standby and have been waiting at the airport for just the hopes of getting a flight. Here I am 8 hours later, stuck in Charlotte. Waiting for the promise of a standby flight, and if I don’t make it onto this flight, I’m stuck here all night. Customer service was the worst experience of my life, and I’m not being overly dramatic. The manager at Charlotte seemed to just direct people away. He didn’t want to help us, even answer basic questions like “Can you connect us to a manager in denver who could help then?” He was indirect, unhelpful, and unsympathetic to the entire situation. Will never fly this airline again."
1416,"Not Verified |  Miami to Denver. Our flight was to leave Miami at 8:25 p.m on a Monday. When we got to our gate at 7:00 p.m we were told to go to another gate halfway across the airport because our gate had be changed. After going to the new location and seating there for about 45 minutes. We were told that our gate had changed back to the gate we were originally at. Finally we get to board the plane around 8:45. The pilot comes over the intercom and says ""please take your seats we only have 6 minutes before our crew times out. At this time the fuel truck had just pulled up. After about 10 minutes. The pilot comes back on the intercom and tells us that the crew has times out and that they were not going to be able to fly us to Denver. So the pilots exit the plane. 10 minutes later the flight attendant come on and say ""we have a new fight crew on the way and we will be leaving as soon as they get here"". 45 minutes to an hour later after sitting on the plane she comes back on only to tell us that there was no new crew and we needed to get off the plane. Now it's around 11:00-11:30. After about an hour of sitting at the gate waiting to hear of any updates. They tell us there's a new fight crew is coming and we would be leaving as soon as they arrived and do there pre-flight checks. So around 12:15 or so the new crew starts to arrive. First 1 pilot, 20 minutes later another pilot, 20 later the engineer comes. I guess. They tell us we will be taking off shortly. Around 1:15 a.m or so. They tell us the the flight attendants have now timed out and our flight would be canceled. It's funny now but not really. They then tell us that we have to go back to the other gate to rebook our flights out. Luckily for us we knew the number to call for rebooking. So we were able to get on the next flight out at 6:45 Tuesday morning. My wife tells me today that they gave her a $100 voucher. Not only did they know they were going to have to cancel the flight but they were dishonest and didn't have to decency to tell us the truth. I have not received anything for them nor do I care to. I will drive to Miami the next time if that's the only way to get there is on American Airlines. They can keep their $100 voucher. If you have any other means of getting to where you need to be I would suggest you use it."
1417, San Diego to Savannah. American Airlines is by far the worst experience I have ever encountered. My flight has been delayed for approximately 4 hours and I am still waiting. If you have to schedule a flight I recommend not to use this one.
1418,"  Dallas to Kona. A surprisingly wonderful experience. It is truly a pleasure to say that everything about this trip was wonderful. They are using an internationally configured aircraft on this seasonal route so the comfort factor was a wow.The attendants were lovely, gracious and efficient in a way that I haven’t experienced with American in a long time. The catering wasn’t great but sufficient and due to the aircraft type wi-fi and entertainment were top notch. Although I know it is not common on American to experience a ride like this so I felt it was important to give credit where it was due."
1419,"  Dayton to Tricities via Charlotte. Horrible layover experience in Charlotte, NC. Incoming Flight delay in Dayton, then they had to change a tire, then we had to wait 15 minutes for a staff member to board. I was okay with the delays but when arrived in Charlotte my connecting flight was delayed too. We arrived 10:47, delayed connector was at 10:50 ""I'll never make it"". So I asked a floor manager to check if the flight was still there, they said it left, it's was 10:50. Come to find out, it didn't leave until 11:03. I could've made it. Then they stuck me in the economy lodge, filthy, nasty and downgraded my seat on the next days flight. First time laid over overnight."
1420,Not Verified |  I wasn’t feeling to well in the middle of the flight and I just wanted to say thank you for the flight attendants on flight 2478 on June 4th from Dallas Ft Worth to Sacramento. They took good care of me. They were very professional and just outright nice. All of them represented their company very well. Thank you.
1421,  Chicago to Kansas City. I am sitting in Chicago waiting on your flight attendants because of poor planning on American Airlines part. Can we not just leave without them? I do not need a drink. The issue is is that they just don't care how you inconvenience others who have to just willing deal with their obvious ability to plan ahead. It is Chicago - American Airlines have hundreds of flights going in and out can't they have backup flight attendent!!
1422,Not Verified |  Philadelphia to Tucson. Absolutely disappointed with trip. First flight was cancelled with only minimal time to reschedule. Rescheduled flight was delayed and captain did horrible job or letting us know and was unsympathetic. No real answers provided except it may be an additional hour stuck on a full flight with a 80% humidity and no air. Completely unprofessional and even de-boarding instructions were less than helpful. You have found a way to lose me not only as a business client but also a personal customer -  good job American Airlines. 
1423,"  Flew Economy round trip between Philadelphia to Budapest about a week and a half after American Airlines started this seasonal service. Overall, I was very pleased with the flights. American's 800-number agents were helpful and friendly; the website was easy to navigate for making reservations; transfers between international and domestic American flights at PHL are easy via an airside shuttle bus or a pleasant 15-minute airside walk. Although older, the Boeing 767 worked well for me: I liked the 2-3-2 seating in Economy, legroom was adequate, seats were reasonably padded, the lavatory had just enough room, and with only around 200 passengers, boarding and deplaning were fairly quick. In Economy, there is no individual flight entertainment. Cabin crew on both flights were attentive and amiable. Check-in at BUD was reasonably quick because American had 4 or 5 counter positions open for this one flight at least two and a half hours in advance. In short, American did a good job."
1424, Flew American Airlines from Chicago to Philadelphia. Constant delays with this airline all the time. Left O'Hare International 45 minutes late and arrived in Philadelphia 10 minutes late. I thought that was pretty good considering. I see 1 plane parked at terminal A and had been sitting on the tarmac for 33 minutes waiting to pull in. Captain just came on and apologized for the delay and informed us operations had no idea when we will be able to pull into one of the 25 gates that are open.
1425,"Not Verified |  Dallas to Baton Rouge. It takes a lot for me to go through the effort of placing a review, but American Airlines has worked hard for this one. I travel regularly from Baton Rouge to Dallas Fort Worth and they are consistently late. Not only are they late they will push a scheduled flight so many times at the last minute it eliminates the option of catching an earlier flight that somehow seems to take off before you thought it was scheduled to depart after your original time. Only a true professional at screwing things up to pull this off. I do this for work because it's the most convenient geographical departure and arrival cities, other than that American Airlines is a complete disappointment."
1426,"  We fly first class mostly between Delta and American Airlines. We are seated right now in American Airlines from SFO to CLT. Our original flight was San Francisco to Dallas with final destination being Ft Myers. Seats generally more comfortable than Delta but no TV, no 110 outlets in our AA flight which means we can’t even watch a movie on our computer for nearly five hour flight. Really? The most annoying thing about American Airlines is they constantly change the time and sometimes the route of the trips. Recently booked RSW to Paris for upcoming September trip and they have already changed the time making it very inconvenient. Our last trip from Vail to RSW had changed with 3 hours of layover in Dallas from 1 hour. I tried to change the time and they said because I had used our miles for that trip, they actually wanted to charge a fee for us to go to economy class (first class was full but we didn’t want all the layover). Again really?"
1427," After waiting for 2.5 hours for my flight at my gate D34 flight AA1606 American Airlines failed to notify me of a gate change. No other flights could get me to work on time so I have lost money because they couldn't get me to my destination on time. They also refused to give me accommodation or even at the very least prioritize my boarding so I can get off the plane as soon as possible to make it to work as early as possible. Somehow they managed to blame me for not getting an alert via email, on their app, etc.. American Airlines has the worst customer service that I've ever experienced and will never fly with them again. It's sad to say but even Spirit is better in every way."
1428, Flew American Airlines from San Francisco to Grand Cayman via Miami. Worst experience ever! Second time in a row. Thought I would give the benefit of the doubt. Never again! Last flight 3 hours delayed and no food or beverages extra. Absolutely appalling. Will never fly AA again. Will gladly get a more expensive flight
1429,"  Los Angeles to London. I am an Executive Platinum (Emerald) member with American Airlines since 1999, and I have flown 1.5m miles with American Airlines. During my flight from Los Angeles to London Heathrow on Jun 5 (Flight AA108) I requested a cabin crew member to have a family member who was seated in 21A to be relocated to a vacant seat close to me. The cabin crew member was very accommodating and personally relocated my family member, Midway through the flight. The purser of the flight approached me an accused me of having the family member illegally take an unoccupied seat. I tried to explain that I requested the relocation with a cabin crew member and she obliged. The Purser continued to be abusive. I advised her that I will be addressing through all means possible.
"
1430,"  Dallas to Oklahoma City. Normally I don’t have problems with AA but after a recent flight cancellation for the second part of my journey, I am very disappointed with the lack of action on AA’s part. My flight which was on a Sunday night was delayed for about 1.5-2 hours at which point it was canceled due to “maintenance issues.” I called AA to reschedule a flight and also went to the customer service desk. I had a flight for work the following morning at 10:30 so I really need to get back. I asked if I could be put on another flight, switched airlines, flown out somewhere else and come from another place, get a rental car, or anything that would allow me to make my flight the next morning. They said there is nothing I can do but I can go online and get a reimbursement which should be up to $120. I ended up having to rent a car and drive from DFW to OKC which cost me about $260. I have tried to be reimbursed for this cost but the best I got was a $100 voucher that has to be used within a year. The problem is very few flights cost $100 so this forces me to fly AA again within the year and have to pay them more out of my pocket so this is in no way a reimbursement but a way for them to secure my future business. Additionally the refund for my flight was $79. I feel like I did everything I could possibly do on my part to remedy the situation and felt very helpless. I am very disappointed with AA’s effort on this and I will likely turn to other airlines in the future. The next flight I could have flown on was at 4:50 the following night and AA never offered to put me in a hotel so I would have just had to stay in the airport or pay for a hotel anyways. AA created a situation where I was at their mercy for assistance and did nothing."
1431,"Not Verified |  My entire American Airlines experience was a complete nightmare. I was traveling from Myrtle Beach to Detroit with my wife and 8-month old daughter. Our original flight plan involved a 1-hour layover in DC. After boarding in Myrtle Beach we were instructed there was a weather delay and we were taken off the plane. After waiting 45+ minutes in line at the gate, and being refused help from the neighboring American Airlines gate, we were rebooked for a 1-hour layover in Charlotte. When that flight was also delayed I expressed concern at the gate because we may not make the connector in Charlotte. The employee was disinterested in helping us find a backup plan in case this occurred. When we arrived in Charlotte we had no chance of making the connector. The employee in Myrtle Beach knew full well that we would not make this connector but sent us onto the plane anyway. After waiting 90+ minutes to speak to customer service in Charlotte we were rebooked to travel to Chicago, then to Toledo. We ran through the airport in order to make the flight to Chicago, but later found out that our checked luggage was left in Charlotte. 4 planes in 4 separate airports before we arrived home (with our 8-month old daughter!) at 12:30a. When I filed a formal complaint with the airline we received a token apology."
1432,  London to Los Angeles. The worst flight by far. Once everyone was on the plane the pilot announced that we were gonna load on more people who’s flight had been cancelled earlier in the day and that this would make us at least an hour late. Once in air the food was horrendous and inedible and that’s coming from someone who never complains about food. Apart from that the bathroom was extremely untidy with sticky toilet seats. When we landed we were once again waiting and were stuck on the runway for approximately 50 minutes. This all resulted in us being over 2 hours late. If you have another option then choose that one because American is a disgrace. I usually fly with Lufthansa and this was really a downgrade.
1433,"  Pittsburgh to Dallas/Fort Worth. I was so happy and impressed with American Airlines Service. I was traveling from Pittsburgh, PA to Lubbock, Texas. I have never flown before and neither have my children. I have a daughter with special needs and disabilities so I made sure to make all the necessary phone calls to airports, TSA, and American Airlines. I wanted to make sure everything would go smoothly for her and that we wouldn't have any problems with her special needs during flights and her special needs stroller. Even though I made all the calls and had pre-boarding, I wasn't expecting the attention we got. Before each flight, I went to remind the American Airlines Customer service rep of our situation but to my surprise, they were already aware. They even said, ""yes, we are all ready for lauren."" They knew her name! I was just amazed. No problems with her stroller getting gate checked and when our flight ended, her stroller was in the terminal waiting for us. Even the flight attendance knew her name and gave her special attention. She even got a chance to see the cockpit. I am so incredibly thankful for the great experience that American Airlines gave us for our first ever flight. You made things so much easier and we were all able to enjoy our first plane ride. Thank you so much again and I hope our return home on Saturday is just as great. I will always fly American Airlines!"
1434,  Miami to Denver. Worst flight experience ever. Was delayed 4 hours due to “weather” although it didn’t look like there was any weather outside. Gate got changed twice which made us walk 20 minutes twice to two different terminals because the gate changes were on opposite ends of the terminal and we weren’t communicated with about why there was a gate change. Once we were at our final gate we continued to wait for our delays to pass and boarded the plane. Once boarded there was an announcement about the flight crew being timed out so they couldn’t fly us and we would have to deplane. We deplaned and waited 2 hours in the gate to get new pilots. Barely any communication about what was going on. Very frustrating and unorganized.
1435,"  Boston to San Francisco via Los Angeles. Worst Experience ever and I am very disappointed with the service. American Airlines suppose to set a high standard for all other Airlines. The service agent are rude and not helpful. I definitely will not use this airline again, and l will not recommended it to anyone. We had to sit at the airport overnight."
1436,"  I have flown AA approximately ten times all with multiple month gaps and each time I hope they have worked out their issues. To my surprise, a well known, multi-million dollar airline continues to operate as if a group of toddlers was in control. I have been delayed on ALL of my flights on this trip by no less than 45 minutes. Twice out of all of these, the original projected delay wasn’t even long enough and as I type this I have waited an additional 15 minutes past the delay. I have experienced one outstanding flight attendant on these flights, the rest we sub-par. AA has little to no entertainment, rabbit food for snacks (not literally), and worst of all, because it saves the airlines a little money, they book absurd amounts of standby passengers (22 on this flight). AA, get back to treating your customers the way customers should be treated instead of trying to fill your pockets. If I had a choice, I’d never fly this airline again."
1437,"  Santa Fe to Sydney via Dallas, Los Angeles. I purchased a ticket through STA travel more than a month in advance from Sydney to Santa Fe round ticket, including my Advantage Number, which I have had for several years. For some reason, even if for some flights I was located at the back of the aircraft, I was placed in all flights to board on group 8 (the group after the very low priority group, even though I had a 3-leg flight). This was a problem on the way back from Dallas to Los Angeles, when they run out of overhead compartments and tried to make me check my carry on all the way to Sydney (they did not offer valet bag checking). I tried explaining that I had a 6 hours layover in LA and then a very long flight to Sydney, and that I needed my carry on (get very cold on places, and was going to arrive to winter in Sydney), and that I did not understand how the system, knowing that I had a long flight ahead would place me in the last boarding group. After a very unpleasant moment with very unfriendly personnel at the Dallas airport, I was able to bring my carry on in some extra spaces available. Additionally, even I had purchased the ticket earlier, the system would not let me pick seats in one of the flights, so I had to travel in the mid seat, next to the bathroom. They should really try to improve customer service, and respect people paying full ticket fare in advance. For now I will try to avoid American Airlines as much as possible in the future."
1438,  Washington to Kansas City. This is single handedly the worst flight experience I have ever had. Both my round trip flights got canceled due to “weather” (light rain) and forced me and my group to spend the night in other cities and our only reimbursement was rice krispie treats.
1439,"  Portland to Charlotte. Every flight has been delayed by 4 plus hours due to poor planning by the company. There was no communication to us about these delays we had to track an employee down for information. My last flight was overbooked along with other flights in the surrounding gates, all American Airlines. I've never had these problems with any other airline. I will never fly through American Airlines again."
1440,"❌ Not Verified |  Kansas City to Philadelphia. I had a reservation to travel from MCI to PHL early morning on June 3rd for a business trip. 8 hours before I left for the airport, I got a text message saying that my flight had been canceled and that I'd been rescheduled for June 4th. I called their customer service and was informed that all flights for June 3rd were completely booked. They didn't even explain what happened or why the flight was canceled. What am I supposed to do - not show up fpor my job? I now have to book on another airline very last minute and this is costing the client money. "
1441,"  Philadelphia to Orlando. Ground crew 15 minutes late to remove plane from gate. Than it took another 35/40 minutes to cross taxi ways to track take off runway. Would not recommend this airline, or Philadelphia to fly out of."
1442,❌ Not Verified |  Ithaca to Oklahoma via Philadelphia / DFW. I am sitting on the runway after being delayed. Second time today. American Airlines has without fail delayed every single trip I have ever taken with them. I fly to and from school at least 3 times a year for the past 3 years and not a single one of those 18 trips have I made it where I was going in the time and fashion American said I would. Because of the size of the town I fly from I have no other choice if airline but ANY other airline would be 100 x better than this. For such a large corporation I would expect much better organization and customer service and I am constantly disappointed that this is the standard.
1443,"  Philadelphia to Detroit. Front row seats for the sorriest excuse of an airline I've ever witnessed. Staff ignorant and delays are infinite, not to mention the endless walks from one gate to the next in hope of an honest resolve. We're paying 75$ per meal and the airport refuses to show any compassion for its customers. "
1444,"❌ Not Verified |  Seattle to Charlotte is a long flight, would have been nice to have a plane with drop down screens and a movie. I guess they want you to use your own device and if you know to download their app, you can watch one for free. Attendants were pretty good. We arrived in Charlotte and I wished we hadn’t. An absolute disaster of an airport. It’s old, dirty, and the people are rude. The American Airlines gates were all full of people who were angry because of delays, etc. Our flight too was late getting out, we sat on for an hour waiting to take off, serious traffic jam. No bad weather, just way too many flights. Return flight: Daytona to Seattle delayed because of a computer routine maintenance not performed? (per the Captain). A billion dollar company who forgets this? This flight delayed a few hours which caused us to miss connection in Charlotte. New flight meant a 9 hour delay in the awful Charlotte airport. Once we board new flight, we sat for 3 hours because of thunderstorms. American Airlines boarded us knowing this storm was here. A storm doesn’t just show up without warning. So 3 hours on tarmac and then 6 hours for flight. A total of 9 hours we were on this plane. The head flight attendant was a jerk (older male). Didn’t smile not one single time and was very rude to some older folks who got up to use bathroom when seatbelt sign came on because of turbulence. Flight attendants were only at row 10 when they ran out of food you can purchase. And to be offered something to drink only once to folks who have been on a plane 9 hours is just pathetic. Never again American Airlines. You could really tell this company doesn’t care much about the value of your money. They figure people are going to buy airline tickets no matter what so there is no need to earn your business."
1445,"❌ Not Verified | I don't understand how I can order two tickets and when we get to the airport the seats are separated. This should be common sense and is very frustrating. Why would anyone offer a service like this. Do you even think of the customer. I have never a bad review for any company in my life, but this is such a bad tactic on American Airlines. "
1446,"  Charlotte to Birmingham. American Airlines cancelled flight at last minute and had me miss funeral and work and had me sitting in airport all day. All they offered me was $50, however when they ask for volunteers to give up seat they offer $500."
1447,"  Cincinnati to Fort Walton Beach. I chose to fly American Airlines because they had a flight leaving about an hour earlier than Delta. Boy was that about the biggest mistake ever. So the actual flying experience wasn’t bad at all. The problem came when my arriving flight into Charlotte, NC to catch a connection was delayed to the gate due to weather. Which was fine, we can’t control the weather. The delay also delayed my connecting flight to Fort Walton Beach. So I was still able to catch my connection. That’s fantastic.  Absolutely it was. So I ask the boarding agent if there was a chance that my checked bag wouldn’t get transferred in time to the connecting flight. She said that it’s very possible that it won’t make it in time. So I said that’s ok I’ll work around picking up my bag the next day. And the next day (today) is where the problem started. I show up at 6am and there’s no one at the baggage claim office, no customer service representative to be found. I talked to the ladies at the ticket counter twice and they told me someone be down to help. So I’m there 3 hours before someone opens the door and it takes 2 minutes to get my bag. Why did it take 3 hours? The monitors show when they have flights departing and arriving. There was plenty of time between to accommodate the 2 minutes it took me to get my bag. My biggest complaint is with customer service. Everything else was as good as it could be."
1448,"  Newark to New Orleans via Charlotte / Chicago. American Airlines is the worst airline I've ever flown. My 5:00 a.m. flight to Charlotte was delayed a little over an hour, because the AC was broken, after we were told it would take 10-15 min to fix. We then missed our connecting flight from Charlotte to New Orleans and the next one was almost 4 hours later. We had paid extra to have seats next to each other and in preferred seating and when we got off the plane and had to get new boarding passes we were basically told too bad nothing they can do about it. When we arrived to New Orleans everything in my bag was damp and all my clothes had to be put in the dryer. But i had nothing in my bag that could've leaked. On the way back, we had a layover in Chicago of an hour until our connecting flight to Newark. 40 minutes before our flight we found out we're delayed an hour and a half. Im sure 500 other things will go wrong before we even get back to Jersey. First and last time I fly American Airlines. "
1449,"❌ Not Verified |  New York to Wichita. After flying once before with American and not having the best experience I decided to give them another shot. On the way here the service was great, 0 delays. Granted that was Memorial Day. Flying home this morning was a pain in the ass. It started arriving to LaGuardia airport this morning with staff who seemed to not be knowledgeable of what they were doing and told me all other flights were booked (not true). My flight was supposed to leave at 1030am from LaGuardia, which turned into 1130am then to 12.50pm mind you I had been sitting st the airport since 8.30am. The only flights left to my final destination was a 10.30pm flight out of DFW meaning I would sit in DFW for 6-7 hours or more depending on delays. Turning a 6 hour travel day into a 17 hour flight day. Additionally I would have missed that flight if I would have not gotten up to go to the restroom and so happen to look at the monitor to see that the gate had changed. No communication what so ever about the gate change. We did not depart to almost 1:15pm - mind you they gave us 0 information about the whereabouts or why our flight was delayed for nearly 2 hours. Finally we made it to Dallas 3.5 hours later. At this point I was tired and irritable. Thank you to the kind woman at DFW working for AA, who got me on a flight sooner than 1030pm, she was patient, kind and emphatic. She made sure I still had my first class seat and all. She turned a very long day into a better one. But after having a experience like this in the past, AA will no longer receive my service nor would I recommend them to anyone."
1450,"  Sioux Falls to Chicago. Our flight was suppose to leave at 6 this morning and we won’t be heading out till 5pm tonight. This is very irritating because we spend a lot of money on our tickets to leave at a certain and were not even leaving anywhere in range to the original time. We received a $24 vouchers for two people for an 11 hour delay. I think that, that is pretty pathetic. We have places to see and things to do and this is a huge waste of my time. I will make sure to tell everyone not to use this airline."
1451,"  Dallas to Cleveland. Gate got changed three times at the airport and the staff were very rude to everyone. Then once we board are already delayed flight, we sit on the plane for 30 minutes and still counting for a pilot. No one said anything to us until now. So, we still don’t know when we are going to start off. The smaller seats on this very crowded flight makes it all more fun to sit on a plane forever. Here’s hoping we actually get to move soon. Horrible airline! Not flying them again!"
1452,"  Denver to Chicago, connecting to Helsinki with Finnair from Chicago. If you can, I would recommend not flying with them. There was a delay to our flight and 30 people were supposed to go on a connecting flight to Finland and they didn't hold the flight, then they promised to rebook everyones flights, and now they're saying all flights are booked until another 24+ hours and are not offering paid hotel vouchers or anything. Horrible customer service. very dissapointed."
1453," Worst experience ever! Going to see my son who is in the Air Force. Flight was delayed overnight. I had the worst help with assistance on changing my flight plans. I was not put up in a hotel, therefore had to pay for two separate hotel rooms as they are non-refundable. Had to change my car rental plans and pay a premium. I was not assisted by a single employee during this situation! I will never fly American Airlines again."
1454,  Phoenix to Roanoke via Charlotte. Avoid the AA local flights out of Charlotte at all costs. Employees are rude and lazy. I will avoid American airlines in the future and cut up the AA credit card. Our money spends the same anywhere and don't need to be treated like these self entitled individuals are actually owed something. If you don't like your job then go somewhere else.
1455,"❌ Not Verified |  Chicago to Seattle. Our flight was scheduled for 8:10 pm on Wednesday night 5/30, originally but then was delayed 4 different times, 9:00, 10:00, 10:30, and finally was scheduled to depart 11:35 pm. Which I can live with and understand except that my girlfriend and I were sitting in the airport over 5 hours watching other planes takeoff. So we sat patiently for 5 hours and finally began boarding at 11:00 pm. American boarded the entire plane and was ready for take off, but then decided to cancel the flight at 11:47 which was after the rescheduled departure time. Then the earliest flight they could get me was in 24 hrs basically causing me to cancel my entire 3 day trip. Plus they didn't even give out hotel vouchers but instead offered cots to sleep on in the airport! I'm just really disappointed in the deception and lack of customer service/ courtesy. Airlines are allowed to do whatever they want and nothing is ever done about it, that's wrong. Treat customers better that's all we ask!"
1456," The Walmart of airlines. Incredibly unremarkable. The International Premium Economy seats are rather nice. The staff seem to care, but it is the details that are desperately lacking, the food which borderlines on institutional, the staff that are nice, but lack passion and enthusiasm, and the paltry amenities that are likes of standard coach of its European rivals. The domestic leg of the journey was reminiscent of Aeroflot of the Soviet days: crammed seating, cabin staff that could not care and food for purchase that is very sub-standard. Come on American, you can do better!"
1457,"❌ Not Verified |  Extremely disappointed with my experience with American Airlines. In a two week span, I had over 6 flights through American Airlines and every single flight was delayed at least a half hour, one being delayed over an hour and a half due to the pilot being stuck in traffic. Two of my flights were cancelled as well. My flight from Charlotte to Minneapolis was delayed an hour and then boarded for an hour and a half before finally being cancelled. I was put on a flight for 8pm the next day, 24 hours later than my original flight. I was not offered a hotel and was only given a voucher for $12 for a 24 hour delay. Staff in a Chicago was rude and not helpful during my standby flights in my attempt to get to Minneapolis earlier."
1458," Punta Cana to Seattle via Miami. Overall the customer service is pretty good with American Airlines. Everyone was friendly to us. My frustration lies with a delay on the ground. It was only announced that the flight would be delayed once we landed because we didn't have a gate, and customs was backed up. We sat waiting for over an hour, returning from an international flight, we still had customs, and another round of security to go through before reaching our connecting flight. We ended up missing our connection, we were rerouted back to the entrance without being told where we were going, when we still had 15min to catch our plane, had they called and had it wait for us, we could have caught it. Instead we were forced to rebook another flight. Communication wasn't great at this point. We thought we were getting rebooked for another route that would get us home only an hour after our original flight, and one flight, as we had originally booked. But we were handed two tickets (rather than the one) on a flight that didn't depart till the next day. They claimed that they don't comp hotels if it's due to weather, the reason for the delay, but no one ever said that we were delayed due to weather. She said I couldn't talk to a manager and wouldn't make eye contact with me after I complained. I would now arrive home a day later, and have to pay $150 more than I originally planned to pay for a cab and hotel. The lady who helped us the next morning was really friendly and didn't charge us to check our bags even though we didn't have receipts for the original payment. She also adjusted our seats so we could sit together. Overall service on the plane was good. Maybe when booking connecting international flights the airlines should require a minimum time in between to eliminate the stress of connecting flights in between. This is not the first time I've had to run from the plane, through customs, and security to catch my connecting flight."
1459,"  St. George to Atlanta via Phoenix. Booked a first class fare and paid a lot of money to get it. The online system would not allow me to choose a seat assignment. When I arrived, I spoke with the gate agent they gave me a coach seat. There were first class seats available and I had paid for a first class seat!  Once boarded there were first class seats available. The crew gave them to American Airlines staff. They made the announcement once everyone was boarded - it was unbelievable! I raised my concern many times. Nobody seemed to care. Hopefully they’ll refund the fare. "
1460,"❌ Not Verified |  Flight 5749 from Amarillo to Dallas would have been nice, except for the horrible service from a flight attendant. When we boarded there was an entire row of seats open and my significant other and I asked if we could move and sit together. The flight attendant said that we could not because the door had already been closed. Then less than a minute later she allowed a couple that had already been seated together to move to the row. There was still an entire row available. Extremely disappointed with the lack of professionalism and lack of consistency shown by the flight attendant and this staff. Will be choosing other airlines in the future if this is the type of service that American Airlines considers acceptable!"
1461," Charlotte to Chicago. I'm writing this in hopes someone that gets paid too much at American Airlines finally makes some changes to improve how they operate. I was the typical customer making a connection that was predetermined by the airline. Using decades of history and algorithms to maximize efficiency for the company and yet getting customer where they need to be you would think this would not be an issue anymore. We got off one plane and literally ran across the airport getting to our terminal 10 minutes before it was scheduled to leave at which they told us ""we knew you were checked in and coming but we can't let you in 10 minutes before flight"". At that time we gave them a confused look as it was 10 minutes before the flight. So you see where I am going with this and why I will never fly with them again but the story gets better from there. We go down to customer service as instructed by the gate attendant to see if we can get on the next flight that is 3 hours delay which sounds good at first but not when you have family waiting for you that drove over 4 hours to pick you up. We had asked if they could do anything from free tickets to a cup of coffee of which they denied saying this happens all the time and it is not our fault. And now for the icing on the cake, they were not sure where our luggage was and after 5 minutes they said it made it on to our original flight. Crazy how that works out right? Now after if spins around the turn style for 45 minutes and hopefully nobody takes it they said it will be picked up and then placed in an office for us to pick up. Long story short, we fly often enough that I am 100% confident saying that American Airlines has some major room to improve so please use another even if you pay a few $ more."
1462,"  Rochester to Boston. This is the third time in a row I have flown with American Airlines and they delayed the departure time by more than 2 hours, not because of the weather but because of “mechanical issues”. Last time it was delayed a total of 5 hours. It is extremely frustrating to be stranded in an airport for such an excessive amount of time because the airline repeatedly has issues with their planes. I realize there are situations that cannot avoided, but for such a lucrative airline I would expect they could afford to have modern planes that don’t require maintenance an hour before departure time. I kept thinking these were random situations that don’t happen too often, but it seems to be American Airlines norm."
1463,"  Washington to Miami. The plane was very old considering its daily usage (18 years) and not very comfortable. The space for legs was below average and I was quite happy we flew for only 2 hours or so. The flight was delayed because of the weather (which is acceptable) but the provided information was poor and misleading. We had to sit for over 1,5 hour onboard waiting for departure and the only information provided was false, then no further info came along. The flight was bumpy and while landing we had to go-around for a second attempt. The staff was OK, no IFE was present and the service contained standard free non-alcoholic beverage and pretzels only."
1464,"  Miami to San Francisco. The plane was quite a new one, looked okay to me. The seat size in economy was quite alright for this type of plane. I suppose it is quite a failure if the only free service onboard was non-alcoholic beverages and a mini-bag of pretzels. No meal is provided for a 6-hour flight and the purchase options are very poor and not clear (it differs based on time and route). The in-flight entertainment on the contrary was a surprise - it worked well and the movie selection was quite wide. What I really don't understand is the seating allocation policy of the airline - we used it twice, always used the recommended kiosk self-check in option and in both cases we got a boarding pass with no assigned seats along with a note ""please see agent at the gate"", which we did and we got the boarding pass from him. I don't see the point of this weird policy and I don't like it."
1465,"❌ Not Verified |  I was very dissatisfied with American Airlines during my last trip. My flight from Colorado Springs to Shreveport was weather delayed in Colorado Springs. I understand that these things happen. But when arriving in Dallas to switch connections to go to Shreveport, I rushed to my gate and found that my plane was still at the gate. But they would not allow me to board. The flight departed earlier than scheduled with me watching it leave the gate without me. I was very disappointed that American did not notify the gate that a passenger was a few minutes late due to their late arrival of a connecting flight. It is not like it was an hour or more, it was 10 minutes at most. Other airlines that I have flown have notified other gates of this happening, especially if it is weather related. I am a frequent flier on many airlines, and it has been done for me before. Due to this, I was under a lot of stress. My main reason for going to Shreveport was to meet my daughter and get her back home to Florida. I went to flight services in Dallas, and they were not any help at all. No monetary help or voucher for a hotel overnight either. They attempted to help me with getting my checked bag that arrived with me in Dallas, but the employee from my arriving gate had already gone home because it was after 9. Because of this, my bag left the next morning to go to Shreveport, even though I was going to be leaving from Dallas later in the day to go back to Florida with my daughter, who was arriving from Shreveport. To make things worse, I had to wait 6 days to get my suitcase returned to me in Florida. After checking with American baggage services, I found out that it stayed in Shreveport for 5 days sitting there. My bag had important business materials inside. Needless to say, unless it is a last resort, I will not be flying American Airlines again. They would not even offer me restitution or a baggage refund for my inconvenience unless I showed receipts of $150.00 or more."
1466,"  Charleston to Bradley via Philadelphia. Absolute worst experience - flights delayed, missed connection, re-routed, flight delayed 3 more times due to a late crew, then boarded and told after that the pilot was then too tired for the 40 minute flight. We were promised hotel vouchers, food vouchers, etc as we were left in a airport at 10 pm with no where to go and no access to transportation or food given the time of night. The AA reps said to save all food and hotel receipts for reimbursement, in which AA is refusing to cover now. Instead, they offered a $200 voucher to fly in the next year which I refuse to do given my experience, and $120 towards the $340 hotel that was the only option left. They also refused to reimburse for meals and are refusing to escalate the matter as their Executives do not take part of these matters. Way to treat your customers American Airlines! Should have read all the negative reviews before I paid $600 for this flight that left me stranded for an extra 2 days in Philadelphia."
1467,"  Washington to Los Angeles via Dallas. The staff at the boarding time was very rude and unfriendly. The lady at the gate was very rude to me and my family, we were in Group 9,the lady kept on telling us that don’t you know what Group 9 means and acted not at all polite with me and my family. I understand that there are rules but there is better way of talking to customers and informing them the rules. This was my first time with American Airlines and my start of the trip was very disappointing. A staff cannot be so rude to my family just because we had more than one bag, and the extra bag was a purse and not a bag."
1468,"❌ Not Verified |  Puerto Vallarta to Tucson. We flew to Puerto Vallarta for our 15th anniversary. The flight there was great. We were saddened to return home from such a beautiful place filled with very nice people. We arrived at the airport early, at 10:00am. When we were trying to process our boarding passes, the woman working at the counter was extremely rude for some reason. Her and her colleague were rolling their eyes and seemed to be annoyed that I was speaking English with my American wife. They made derogatory comments towards my wife being American. She became irate when I was explaining to her that I was a Permanent U.S Resident. I speak fluent Spanish and she ignored me and said she had to call immigration in Phoenix? She left and returned to process my wife's pass. I asked her if I could explain to whomever she was trying to contact my status. I told her that I obviously boarded a plane to get here, and that I needed to get home. I was polite the entire time and she was rude to my wife for no reason. She then said. I can't let you board. No explanation what so ever. My heart sank. I maintain composure and asked her to let me talk to her imaginary friend who she supposedly called at Customs. She just smiled and said Sorry. I asked her to have my Wife board and then I would need a flight rearranged to my native Sonora so I could contact someone at the Consulate. She faked smiled again and said sorry, we can't do anything. She then said I would have to purchase another ticket. I promptly bought a ticket on AeroMexico and had no issues getting to Hermosillo, except for the fact that my Wife flew alone, She had to explain to my two kids that I was in Mexico because some AA rep at the desk was discriminating me because I am Mexican and live in the US, Not to mention I had to fly to Mexico City, get delayed to thunderstorms there 2 hours, finally flew to Sonora at Midnight. I arrived in Hermosillo at 2 in the morning. Somehow I got to the Nogales border, thanks to a friend. Crossed the U.S Border at 7am with no issues. I had to be at work. I was exhausted and very frustrated. Honestly a terrible way to end our 15 year anniversary. Never flying AA ever again."
1469,"  New York to London. After reading many recent poor  reviews of American Airlines, we were concerned that we too might have a flight of horrors. However, our experience was the opposite of most of the recent reviews. The Flagship Lounge at JFK, while very busy, provided a good opportunity for a pre-flight meal. The flight, AA 100, to LHR left a few minutes behind schedule, but landed on time. The flight attendants offered reasonably friendly in-flight service throughout. There was more food and drink on offer during the flight than anyone could have wanted (dinner, snacks, more snacks, breakfast). The lie flat seat, with Casper bedding, while a tad firm for some most likely, provided the opportunity to get a short nights sleep. Fortunately, we never experienced even one of the horrors that so many reviewers have written about. We will fly back to JFK on Monday, in the Premium Economy cabin, and if the experience is any different, based of course on what is reasonably expected in that cabin, we will add a review."
1470,"  Philadelphia to Manchester. The worst experience - flight delayed for more than 2 hours in May 2018, no snow, no natural conditions, and no compensation for the delay. This flight is not for you if u are planing to return back to work on time. International flights delay first - they try to delay 1:45 hours so as not to cross 2 hours then after they delay additional. No respect for customers timing"
1471," Austin to Lisbon via Philadelphia. Avoid this airline unless you are a masochist. On the Philadelphia - Lisbon leg we experienced a 4 hr delay and two equipment changes. On the return, the DFW - AUS leg, a 90minute delay and a gate and equipment change. Not surprising really with the very very old planes being flown. Thet certainly show their age, rattling like a tin can at take off and landing. And how about a transatlantic flight these days with no inflight entertainment? Yep still the norm on AA flying the 767. And anyone who thought that the MD-80 was strictly a museum piece, well no, it's part of the AA fleet. No surprise the constant maintenance issues and consequent delays.."
1472, Flew American Airlines from Miami to London. Cabin was reasonable but service was very poor. One visit for both bar and meal. No response to in-seat steward request to collect tray meaning a walk to the end of the plane to get someone. Ground service was a bit harsh.
1473,"❌ Not Verified |  Terrible. Absolutely terrible, both to and from Philadelphia and Phoenix. Boarded and got off the plane both times because of an issue, you think they would have resolved that before letting everyone get on. They let us sit forever blaming it on catering and other various issues. Don’t get me wrong I’m glad they didn’t fly with any detrimental issues to the aircraft but come on. Also both times, there was an error with calculating carry one baggage leaving no room for the last passengers to board and they did not complimentary check any. Will never fly with American Airlines again."
1474," First I'd like to start out saying that 20 years ago, I had the exact same result as I did this past weekend and swore I would never fly American Airlines again. I was returning to Houston from Salt Lake City, I had to go thru Dallas for a connecting flight. My flight in Salt Lake City was delayed due to weather issues originally. I knew I was going to miss my connecting flight in Dallas, once I heard of the delay and got up in line (a long one at that) to be told to call the 1-800 number to get done faster. When I spoke with customer service, they told me ""I'll be fine as the plane is supposed to board at 4.08 pm"" and I was like ""Oh great, ok, I don't need anything else then"". Not realizing the time when I hung up the phone, it was 4.12 pm and there was no plane at the gate. So, we (as in other passengers and myself) were getting updates saying we were boarding every 10 minutes. Come to find out, because of the weather, the plane that was trying to land was re-routed to Pocatello, ID because they needed to re-fuel. The plane finally landed around 6.15 pm, only to learn that our flight was now cancelled due to the fact that the flight crew had met their hours for the day and couldn't fly anymore. So, at that point we were all stranded, most other flights were full and I for sure was going to miss my connecting flight. Supposedly, because this was a weather issue, American Airlines would not put any of the passengers up in hotels, etc. However, it was no longer a weather issue as other planes were flying in and taking off just fine in Salt Lake City. This was clearly, American Airlines crew that couldn't fly anymore. So our flight was delayed until 7.00 am the next morning. So we return to the airport, did not receive any updates on our flight and hoping for the best I spoke with the gentleman at the gate and asked him to help me find a connecting flight to Houston. He told me, they were all full and to try once I get to Dallas to get on stand by. I finally make it to Dallas, I get off the plane and go directly to the ticket counter at the gate that I just walked out of. I explained that I needed a connecting flight to Houston. At first, the lady couldn't find me in the system (even though I just walked off the plane) and then once she did find me in the system, she said she had record of me landing the night before in Dallas. At this point, I was boiling mad, because clearly she just saw me walk off the plane. Then she said, there was a flight later in the evening that she could get me on. I explained it was my daughter's graduation party that evening and I needed to be home before 8.00 pm that night. So, she handed me a boarding pass and told me to go try and get on Stand by on another flight. Went to that gate only to find out there was a lot of other people standing by and probably would not make that flight and at that point I went and got a rental car so I can be home in time for my daughter's graduation party, that I was hosting. My biggest disappoint in the airline is that not one American Airlines employee even said ""I'm sorry!"" When you work in customer service and have an upset customer, you should always acknowledge that you understand the frustration and you are working hard to get us home or to resolve the issue. This never happened with American Airlines. I was met with one rude person after the other. It wasn't just me. There were other passengers that were just as upset and had to drive home too."
1475," The lady at the counter before entering the plane was rude and didn't care what I had to ask. I got my ticket printed by a lady and asked if I had to check my bag and she said no I would be fine and the plane would have room for a carry on. Well I go to get on the plane and they won't let me on without paying 50 dollars. Why didn't the lady who printed my ticket tell me? Why didn't they announce it for all of section 9 until right before the flight was boarding, when I would have had time to go back to the baggage claim and only have to pay 25 dollars instead of 50 now for a carry on size. No military discount for luggage either which is ridiculous. I will never fly American Airlines again with how rude they were."
1476,"❌ Not Verified |  I need to praise the crew of Flight AA743 Barcelona to Philadelphia. The crew on this flight was great. they made each passenger feel really welcomed. The crew was nice, friendly, helpful, and kind. I can't say enough good thing about this crew. Wanted to say a great big thanks to this crew. Thank you so much. "
1477,"❌ Not Verified |  I had a trip planned to Puerto Rico for my birthday. I Arrived at 5am to DCA To a weather delay (understandable) Couple hours passed and when we went to board the plane a new maintenance issue caused a 20 minute delay. For the next 5 hours they kept extending the maintenance delay every 30 minutes. There was almost no communication with each attendant telling different answers. The app was also extremely unhelpful. After waiting in airport for 12 hours, they finally cancelled the flight as never going to leave the terminal. I called customer service for a refund and they said that they might be able to reschedule. Another attendant the said that I should still cancel and get refund since the airline was backed up and going to be prone to more weather delays and maintenance issues. (Every person had different answers) I asked if I could just get a voucher to help make up for lost hotel, stress, etc. Two reps said yes but another said that they couldn’t. Long story short they cancelled my flight then left me out to dry with just the refund of my ticket and no additional vouchers. I am still out a large sum for the trip not including lost vacation days and stress. This was the worst customer experience of my life. I was a loyalty program member with an AA credit card and was Still treated this way by staff and the company even after filing a complaint. “...They told me (paraphrase) that it was not their obligation and that I should give them a second chance...” I was lied to and lost an entire vacation to their terrible maintenance and business practices and would urge no person to use AA as their preferred loyalty program. My friend who flew Spirit Airlines that same day made it to Puerto Rico for my birthday but I never did."
1478,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Cancun. Horrible Airline! I always use Southwest because they’re great but this one was booked by my company. American will nickle and dime you for everything possible. I spent over 50 USD just to fly with 1 checked bag round trip. Next was the seat charge, any seat with a few extra inches of leg room will cost you a minimum of 34 extra each way! Once onboard is their in flight snacks, they start at 9 and increase significantly. On this particular trip they switched the gate and terminal 4 times within the span of 2 hours before the flight which made for some long walks. Surprisingly our flight arrived 30 min early but we had to wait the entire 30 minutes on the plane at the gate before we could deboard because they couldn’t find an employee to move the sky bridge into place! Then there is the fact that the WIFI didn’t work and the mid plane bathroom was inoperative. I would avoid this airline if possible. These are the very reasons I prefer Southwest and I fly monthly."
1479,"  I did not fly. They cancelled the flight just as I was going through security. The ticket agent could not book me on anything that would remotely get me to destination in time for obligations (they were offering 24 hours later). I asked if I could get my fare back if I drove the 450 miles. The agent said yes. My travelling companion heard this too. I asked twice. And now they refuse to refund my fare. They also lost my luggage for 36 hours, a suitcase that was never loaded onto a flight that never got to the gate. It was cracked and contents damaged when delivered and they said nothing until I reported it. Still waiting for reimbursement for ruined suitcase and contents. I'm giving them a 1 instead of 0 because some of the employees were trying to help."
1480,  San Jose to Boston. Horrible customer service! They keep delaying the flight every 30 minutes and do not provide a real picture! Stranded since 3 hours and still no clarity. I would recommend you take Spirit and save some money rather than taking this airline!
1481," My direct flight to Boston was cancelled this weekend, no explanation, no weather issues (all other airlines were flying out). The soonest they could get me on a flight was the next day with 2 (two) stops. I would miss my wedding so did not take it. My complaint is, when they cancelled the flight, only one employee was at the gate trying to reschedule everyone's flights. The American gate next to it, had 5 employees, talking, laughing, not doing anything. I went over to them and asked if they could help me. I had been in my line for 30 minutes and the employee had only gotten through 2 people! So you can imagine the anger of everyone in line! The 5 employees at the adjacent gate said they couldn't help and really didn't seem to care enough to walk over to our gate to help that 1 lone employee. I found that to be so incompetent for this or any airlines. Worst part for me was, my daughter was gong to the same wedding, also flew out from the same airport, same time, with JetBlue. And her ticket cost half as much as mine! So my daughter, poor thing, landed in Boston and spent the weekend by herself. No excuses. Never again American if I have another choice."
1482," I fly a decent amount. This is my first time flying American Airlines and will probably be my last. I flew from SLC to Dallas and it was delayed many hours and caused me to miss my other connecting flight. I got over it. Now I’m flying back to Salt lake and it’s 2 weeks ago and of course, another delay! Kind of pathetic that literally both of my flights have been delayed. Not just one. Safe to say I will never be flying with American Airlines because they’re 2 for 2 for long delays. This has caused extreme problems and anxiety due to work meetings. What a joke. American Airlines is well known for their delays and I gave them a chance. They failed miserably. Fly any other airline than American."
1483,"  Phoenix to Charlotte. The worst customer service ever! When I checked in there was no line however I was acknowledged by, “where are you going?” No, good morning even after I said it. Then she proceeded to check me in smacking her lips and hugging as if I was being bothersome by checking in. Instead of asking, “May I see your ID.” She says do you even have an ID. A women she was not checking in with she began to argue with saying, “lady we can’t do anything, if you want something you’re just gonna have to wait until 3 am that all I have for you.” Not polite. Ruining the brand name."
1484,"  Denver to Los Angeles. Good flight overall. Friendly staff. Soft landing. Tired of hearing about the credit card offer. Yes, we're a captive audience, please stop exploiting this."
1485,"  I was booked to fly from Pittsburgh to Amsterdam via Philadelphia. Once landed in Philadelphia, the flight to Amsterdam was cancelled. The employees were totally not helpful and not giving any direction. Finally one of them said that we had to go to the customer service. Once there, we had to wait like 2 hours in a huge queue. Disaster. The customer service agent booked a ticket for us via Dublin. We had to wait 6 hours longer. Once we asked the customer service agent the reason of cancellation the given answer was: I dont know, i just get 8 dollars per hour. They don’t share this kind of information with me. Very unprofessional."
1486,"  . Little Rock to Washington DC. Horrible customer service, waited an hour and a half to check my bag in. Missed my flight and they told me to go the back of the line to get my flight rescheduled. There were 5 people working to check people in and 2 of them left never to be seen again. I was told to wait on their manager and waited another 30 minutes and the manager never came. This will be the last time that I fly American Airlines."
1487,  We wanted to change our seats and check in online but it wouldn’t let us. Got to the airport and still wasn’t able to change our seats due to technical issues after waiting for them to try to figure it out for an hour and a half we told them we have to go through security and left. When we got on board the flight my screen didn’t work and I told the flight attendant she was very rude and just nodded. Told her a few more times she rest a few times and still didn’t work. We asked another attendant and she rest it a couple more times and still didn’t work. They didn’t do anything else about it. So I got WiFi and that didn’t work well either after paying $19 couldn’t listen to music or watch anything. All the employees were rude. The last time we fly on American Airlines.
1488,  This will be the last time I fly with American Airlines. Arrived to Charlotte for my connecting flight to Hartford and was told there's no aircraft available so my 7 a.m. departure was delayed till 2:30 p.m. Thanks to American Airlines mistakes I will now miss my daughter's college graduation. They're making me jump through hoops and Loops to get a refund my wife and I am extremely disappointed with this Airline and will not fly American Airlines again
1489,"  Reno to Los Angeles. We recently had to fly out for a death of a family member. American Airlines staff were so helpful with my elderly mother and our flight mix up from Expedia (who were not helpful at all). I will recommend American Airlines to everyone, they went above and beyond in our eyes, they were wonderful and thoughtful of our situation. Thank you"
1490,  Raleigh to Miami. I came to the airport at 10:30 flight scheduled to leave at 12:03 which was delayed until 12:20. The supervisor was very rude. She wasn’t trying to help us at all. The lady in charge stated that our seats was given to someone else which is ridiculous when my flight has been booked for months. It’s very unfair to people that have waited for 2 hours and still don’t get to get on your correct flight. I was put on standby then that may not even help because this flight is full also.  Which only leave a flight for early in the morning and I have already paid for my Room and everything ! I will never recommend anyone to fly American Airlines because they do not know how to treat people. They are rude and very disrespectful. The supervisor never apologized or even ask If we were okay. I am very upset. I have been sitting at the airport for 7 hours and I don’t even know if I will be able to board at 7:30.
1491," Charlotte to Pittsburgh. My first flight was freezing with no blankets. Then my final flight was delayed 4 hours! After I had gotten up at 2AM. Ironically, I had actually tried to change this flight a week earlier and they told me it would cost me $200 + a $50 service fee. Then they change the flight at the very last minute and I get zero compensation. How is this fair? I've flown around 20 trips, this is the first and last time I will use AA. Never had these issues with other airlines."
1492,"  Washington DCA to Miami. Got to the airport 45 min before flight, which is never an issue at this airport, was unable to check in, told the lady and asking they could assist! She said no, too late! Stand in line and see what they say! Line was too long so had to rebook and missed my flight and my meeting in Miami!"
1493,  Dallas Ft Worth to Washington. Worst experience ever. I am never flying American airlines ever again. I got 40 minutes before the flight and was told that I was late to board and was even dropped off. I was treated like I had never been in a flight ever in my life. And  I even had my boarding pass with me. And when I said I didn’t want my baggage if I was late for the baggage checkin the lady in the counter said the plane is ready to leave. The flight was for 7:10 and I was there at 6:30. She said the only way I could fly the same day was if I was on a standby and paid the fair difference and all other  extra charges that would make up to $470 or more. I doubt if they are there to make money out of nothing and making fool out of people like me. I strongly don’t recommend this airline.
1494,"  Dallas to Milwaukee. When we arrived at the gate, we were told that we had to check our bag. In fact, they did not let anyone in basic economy bring on their bag. Then when we boarded we found that there was plenty of overhead room. 2 minutes after boarding, I went to fetch my bag, with my bag tag in hand, and they refused to give me my bag; it was right in front of me! I am outraged at their obstinance. I pack so that I never have to check my luggage because I loathe waiting to pick it up. I am a very dissatisfied customer."
1495,"  Lihue to Orlando via Los Angeles, My first flight was delayed due to filling up fuel and landed at 7:55am. Our connecting flight left at 7:58am. Our bags therefore did not make it on the connecting flight but lucking I made it. My flight landed at 3:30pm and I received our bags at 12:45am! The delivery company called and woke me up several times (I had work the next morning) confused about directions on how to get to my address. After expressing my frustrations through several phone calls while waiting for my bag, I was then informed that I could have scheduled the bag to be delivered the following day but now it was too late because it was already on its way out."
1496,"  Indianapolis to Tucson via Dallas Ft Worth. This flight was canceled and a text was sent to confirm a rescheduled flight for the following day. Due to work conflict, I asked to be re-routed; ended up in Chicago, delayed several hrs til that was canceled too. American Airlines said they would not pay for lodging or food costs incurred for this extra night, nor would they provide any refund for the significant inconvenience and work hours lost. They could not even provide me with an email address to file a complaint - I was told to go to their website & find the email address myself, if I really needed it. Worst experience ever and American Airlines does not care. Photo here was compliments of United, nothing was provided from American Airlines"
1497,"  Frankfurt to Nashville via Charlotte/Philadelphia. Though American Airlines doesn't get much credit on this site, our trip worked out fine. We had 4 flights with them and all were bang on time. I like the fact that AA flies in Frankfurt from the much quieter terminal 2. We were recevied by very friendly groundstaff and had our bag dropped within 15 mins. AA holds firmly to the boarding-by-group system which I like very much. The flight from Frankfurt to Charlotte was good: a rather tasty meal and plenty of drinks and snacks. We only had 1,5 hour connection time to Nashville, so we were a bit weary about that, because you have tot go through immigration and collect your bag again and go through security again, but is was okay. Airport staff is ready tot take your bag immediately from you after immigration so you can rush through security. By the time we got tot the gate boarding began and again we had a very punctual departure for Nashville. Small snack and a drink on this one-hour flight was enough. Checking in in Nashville for our inbound flight again was a breeze. Again very friendly ground staff (we've experienced different before!) and within 10 mins we were at the gate. Flight from Nashville to Philadelphia took only 1,5 hours in stead of the advertised 2 hours and 10 mins and that was good since we had only 50 mins connecting time in Philadelphia. Still quite a run because we arrived at B10 and our plane to Frankfurt was at the furthest gate (A26). By the time we arrived we were almost the last ones to board. Our son wasn't assigned a seat in Nashville but his boarding pass with seat was ready in Philadelphia. Four the fourth time a very punctual departure. Again a meal, rather bland but okay and plenty of drinks and snacks. Breakfast -well, sort of- an hour for landing. 280 films and games to choose from. Crew over all not very friendly but never unfriendly. In less than seven hours to Frankfurt, landed almost an hour earlier. All in all a very good experience. Would definitely fly again."
1498,"  Charlotte to London Heathrow. I was so disappointed in my experience with American Airlines. I just returned from a flight on Delta and it was a far and away better experience than with AA. The difference was night and day. On both my flights to and from London, the crew never cracked a smile, never had a welcoming word, never answered a request for service with an agreeable attitude. They obviously didn't want to be dealing with the customers and were, at times, even sarcastic to their passengers. My touch screen didn't work but I didn't dare ask the attendants for assistance and get a snarky answer. The food was marginal, at best, but it was the attitude of the crew that spoiled the travel. The gate crew on Charlotte even mocked the passengers from the preceding flight within hearing of the waiting passengers. No wonder my flights were not full. Unless I have to choose American Airlines in the future, I will be flying anyone else. They got us there safely, but that was the extent of the service."
1499,"  Burlington to Tampa via Charlotte. The pilots and crew left the gate 20 minutes late and then stopped a few hundred feet from the gate and made the passengers sit on the runway for nearly an hour and lied to us about “its weather related"" - but it was clear skies and both airports. American is such a disorganized and poorly run airline as every leg of my two days of flights had problems. I strongly recommend not flying with them!!"
1500,"  Colorado Springs to Nashville via DFW. As usual, my American Airlines flight was delayed. My flight out to Colorado Springs was delayed by and hour. Then my return flight was delayed! I was supposed to take off from Colorado Springs at 8:30am but the flight was delayed by 2 hours. This, as said by the airline, was because the plane was late arriving the night before. Due to the 2 hour delay, I missed my connector flight in Dallas. The only other flight to Nashville from Dallas was at 4:30 in the afternoon (original flight was scheduled to leave at 12:30). So I spent 4 hours sitting around in Colorado Springs waiting on the ""delayed flight"", I spent 3 hours waiting around in Dallas because of my ""delayed"" flight. To top it off, when we DID finally land in Nashville, the ground crew wasn't at the gate so we had to wait on the tarmac until they got to the gate to offload the plane!! What a wreck this airline is!"
1501,"  Milwaukee to Charlotte. I will never fly American again! They wouldn’t change my partners and my seats so we could sit together, even though when we initially booked we picked seats together. Our seats had changed without our knowledge. Also, they had me place my tiny wallet purse inside my backpack because you can only have one carryon item that can be placed under the seat, However both items would have fit under the seat. Lastly, do not get seats in the very back of the air craft. They do not recline and they actually lean you uncomfortably forward. Worst flight experience ever."
1502,"  Chicago to Paris. What a disaster of an airline - one mistake after another, one 'no' after another and bad hard product to boot. This was the second flight en-route back to Paris. That flight was late a ran to make this flight. Sat down, asked for a cold towel - no, asked for a glass of champagne - no, asked to wash in the bathroom - no. Through out the flight the service was terrible and rude with the exception of one cabin crew who tried to help. The flat bed seat rocked like a baby's cradle and when asked for assistance told, ""I'm not an engineer, you need to deal with it"". Throughout the flight every time the person next me moved my seat would shudder and move. As you can guess - no sleep into Paris. The crew was just mean and harsh, there was no improvement in the airline since I last flew them 5 years ago. Will not be flying them again - ever."
1503,"  Pittsburgh to Chicago O’Hare. I fly weekly for work as a business traveler between Buffalo, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh. I live in Chicago. As you can imagine, this leaves little flexibility in my schedule. When I do have a change in my schedule that allows me to get home faster, I try to fly standby or change my flight. Every time I am told there is a $200 or $75 change fee that cannot be waived. Considering I have been traveling every single week for 6 months now, it is extremely frustrating that I am not able to switch flights without paying an unreasonable fee when there are open seats on a flight. I have already paid for my original ticket. United has been able to make this change for me with no problem. If you are a business traveler, do not fly American. When there is a flight delay there is nothing we can do as travelers about it. No compensation, just told to wait 2+ hours. But when we can change flights and open a seat for someone else, time to pay up."
1504,"  Los Angeles to Atlanta. This American flight had tons of issues. Most concerning was that the aircraft came out of maintenance following service with problems remaining. The plane came out of LAX maintenance with non-functional entertainment systems, about which the crew were never notified. Oddly, even though the plane was sitting at LAX, the plane was nearly 2 hours late to the gate. This was a serious problem, because the pilots were set to time out 1 hour and 18 minutes after the original departure time. A series of blunders followed, including a broken fuel pump, which slowed refueling. We ultimately left with under a minute remaining before the pilots would have timed out. I don't like an airline flying by the seat of their pants. The only positive were the flight crew, who may have been the most pleasant crew I have encountered with an airline. However, they weren't able to cover for American's failings here."
1505,  Atlanta to Miami. My flight was suppose to leave March 27 at 6:50am we got on the plane only to sit there for a hour we made it to the runway only to be told from the captain there was a maintenance problem so we had go get off. They kept sending us updates every hour our flight didn't leave until 1pm.
1506,"  New York to Myrtle Beach via Charlotte. 4 flights and 5 airports - JFK, CLT, MYR, DCA, LGA. Superb experience. All flights were on time and on couple of times early. Flight attendants were attentive. A good selection of snacks served and soft and hard drinks offered. Cockpit crew were communicative. Planes were clean and bright. The seats were spa copy's with ample leg space. Boarding was well organized. The only improvement would be to install electric charging sockets on the seats of the Embraer aircraft."
1507," We flew to Hawaii for our daughters spring break this year and our 20th wedding anniversary. We had 2 flights to Hawaii both 6 hours long. From Philly to the Big Island there were no TV’s on either flight. One little screen in the aisle that dropped down and played one stupid movie. Two passes of the beverage cart with a handful of pretzels. American Airlines need to put planes into service that have individual TV’s for flights that are longer than 3 hours. Our red eye home from LA also had no TV’s. Thanks American Airlines from all the people who cannot sleep on a night time flight! I couldn’t even get a pillow and a blanket on my red eye! Last year I flew coach on Lufthansa to Germany and was in row 38. I felt like I was in first class! Free booze the duration of the flight, full dinner served with real plates and silverware that was complimentary, and pillows and blankets, and wait for it! TV’s for every single passenger! American Airlines needs to see how to keep their passengers happy buy making their flight more comfortable and not dumping all their money into Philadelphia Terminal B. Every single seat at every bar, lounge, waiting are had a tablet and a charging station next to it. The place looked like a night club! So much for keeping your passengers on your flights comfortable!"
1508,"  Lafayette to Roswell via Dallas Ft Worth. My Mother and I had our flight cancelled which was fine. So we rebooked. While rebooking we didn't realize that we booked different flights. One on Tueday and one on Wednesday. They are for the same time, different days. We immediately noticed the error and contacted AA. They wouldn't even let us correct the error without paying 200 dollars. This is easily the worst service that I've received from an airline. We are so upset because now my Mom will have to drive 1.5 hours to the airport to pick me up. We will never fly American Airlines again."
1509,"  Paris to Atlanta via Charlotte. Never again I will fly my family with American Airlines, after my mom, wife and daughter, missed their connecting flight in Paris because the first one, from Sofia was late they did not put them on another flight till the next day, they spend 8 hrs stuck at the airport. After all they put them in a hotel with no transport to the hotel so they got a taxi, paid for the taxi themselves and the worst is they put them in a room with a complete stranger who also missed his flight, my mom daughter and wife! So they had to get a different room. Also we paid $160 extra to have the first row sits to have more room - didnt get the seats or the money back, customer service is horrible."
1510,"  Fayetteville to St Louis via Charlotte. Arriving connection aircraft grounded for maintenance then after 1.5 hour delay & crew change, AA team raced to board already irate customers onto aircraft with a maintenance problem just to make it like they were ""concerned"". Approx 100 fliers strapped in for half hour so pilot could announce can't fix maintenance & the crew will be out of crew rest & need to change too. Approx. Total 5 hours of jerking customers around. Retired pilot here. Totally unacceptable. Never AA again!"
1511,"  Philadelphia to Boston. If you choose to fly American, expect delays and cancellations. Expect to hear excuses like overbooking, maintenance, or insufficient staff availability. Expect to be greeted by rude customer service agents when you try to make other arrangements. Expect a hard fight to receive any form of compensation for the inconveniences that they inflict on you. Expect to talk to numerous agents on the phone and at the airport, wasting hours of your time, until you eventually (if you have the patience to see it through) find that one person who will take five seconds of their time to help you. Expect some staff members to simply ignore you when you ask them questions. Expect that you will not make it to your destination at the time printed on your ticket. Even if you do make it onto a plane eventually (likely not the one you originally booked) expect it to be very cramped and uncomfortable. I have flown American Airlines numerous times over the past few years. Every time is a struggle. At  Boston Logan Airport and Philadelphia Airport especially, the staff simply refuse to help when something goes wrong. They will instead resort to silence or walk away when you try to ask a question. At American Airlines, your problems are not their concern. Getting you to your destination on time is not their concern. Your comfort is not their concern. Their only concern is your money, which they will hold onto even when they fail to provide the services you paid them for."
1512,"❌ Not Verified |  Hawaii to Dallas Fort Worth. If you’re flying first class they shouldn’t run out of meals for you. They told me they only had one meal left and it was vegetarian. I was starving and the food was horrible, and I’m not a vegetarian. I paid good money to fly comfortably, and the aircraft should be fully stocked and prepared for the amount of passengers on board!"
1513,"❌ Not Verified |  Miami to Toronto. I will never fly American Airlines again. Our flight was cancelled on Sunday April 15 to Toronto due to bad weather. I understand why the flight needed to be cancelled, however we were told by American Airlines staff that our luggage had been sent too Toronto on another flight. Which made absolutely no sense to me. We did not have a return flight until Wednesday which meant we had 3 days without any clothing/personal products. I requested some sort of financial compensation because of this and was told that baggage does not handle compensation and to go upstairs and put in a request. When we were upstairs we were told to get into 3 different line ups once we were finally able to speak to someone we were told that they did not provide compensation (I understand about the flight cancellation but believed they should not have sent our suitcases ahead without us). I asked to speak to the supervisor and she told me that they have nothing to do with baggage and if I wanted financial compensation I needed to go back to baggage. She then checked our baggage tags and said our luggage was still in the airport. We then went back downstairs and spoke to someone who was in the luggage area, he was extremely rude so I asked to speak to his supervisor and he refused to call one. His coworker could tell I was becoming visibly upset so called a supervisor. She then left. We waited for approximately 10 minutes and ask the employee who had refused to call a supervisor if they were coming and he said ""no, if you want to speak to a supervisor you need to stand in that line over there"". So we went and stood in line again . Once through the line I asked to speak to the supervisor and told her that we were told upstairs that our suitcases were still in the airport. She said they maybe here but we could not have them and they were going to be forwarded to Toronto. I then asked for financial compensation for toiletries, clothing etc and she told me I had to go back upstairs to Customer Assistance that they do not handle compensation. I then lost my temper because this was the third time I was told to go to a different spot. Every single staff I dealt with at American Airlines that day was extremely rude and continuously told us we were in the wrong line up, department or it wasn't something they handled. We did eventually get our luggage back the next day but I believe it was largely do to the fact that I was persistent and lost my temper. I would like to mention that there was one staff member in customer assistance who was pleasant to deal with when my mother and I went to confirm our seat on Tuesday April 17th - he needs need to find another airline to work for, and is far too nice of a person to be working with such rude, awful, unhelpful people."
1514,"  Phoenix to Dallas. First the ticket is overpriced. In order to have a seat they want to charge you even more money. I get to the gate shown on my boarding pass, find they've changed it with no notification. Have to walk miles to get to the next gate. Then I have a small case to put under my seat and told they will charge me. This is the worst airline."
1515,"  Chicago to Tampa. Your fare has restrictions. Be sure to read up on the rules before you go to the airport. And once on board, enjoy the same great service and free snacks, soft drinks and inflight entertainment. You can bring 1 item that fits under the seat - No access to overhead bin. Pay for and check bags before security or pay bag fee + $25 (per bag) at the gate. Also keep in mind you can pay to choose a seat 48 hours before departure or we'll assign one to you when you check in. Your fare is not eligible for upgrades, flight changes or refunds. Even though you board last, make sure you give yourself time to check bags and get to the gate. All Basic Economy rules Yes, and after all of the above, there are more rules! $100 to check bags (both ways). Money grubbing airline! I have always flown southwest, and never felt like I was being nickle and dimed by them. I will never fly American again. I think this ended up costing at least $100 more than Southwest, and they make sure you don't get to sit with your traveling partner. It seemed that almost everyone who was traveling together was sitting apart from each other. And seats are assigned! "
1516,"  Los Angeles to Charlotte. American Airlines is now in the class of Allegiant and United. Aside from overcrowded gates, remote less costly terminals, burned out flight attendants, and a la carte fares, the latest grab is the fare that allows no access to overhead bins! I fly domestically and internationally 20 or more times a year, and I can honestly state that nearly every experience where i am forced to use American Airlines is negative and I work hard now to avoid it."
1517,"  Dallas to Minneapolis. I will never fly this airline again. The airline does not value its customers or have any understanding of good customer service. After making a 5 hour drive to Dallas to catch this flight, I arrived at the airport around 10ish and we made it through security around 10:30ish. The flight was scheduled to start boarding at 11:45 at C29. I checked the board around 11 to confirm and still had this gate. Around 12 after the flight had not been called I wondered if I was at the right gate. I pulled up flight on my phone which said flight had been changed to C28 which was in hearing range of where I was sitting. The flight was never announced and I had missed it. When I went to counter, the agent proceeded to tell me that it was my responsibility to find out which gate and they did not have to announce it. I informed the agent I had checked the board within the hour and the gate was listed as C29. He stated everyone was already there and so he didn’t have to announce. However me and my 4 kids were less than 15 yards away and we were not on board. Even the “customer care” department who I spoke with on the phone had this not my problem attitude. If I had not been so close to the terminal from which my flight departed I would not have a problem. But I am sitting in the airport now hearing flights being announced and last call for passengers and I’m still not sure why my flight was so different?"
1518,"  Maui to Regina via Phoenix/Calgary. What should’ve been a 12 hour trip home turned into almost 3 days because of inconsistency with this company. First flight got delayed because a piece fell of the airplane, so missed all of our flights and had to get reconnected. Then, got to the airport on 2 hours of sleep, only to be told after waiting in line for 2 more hours that our 8 am flight wasn’t available. Fast forward to our last flight from Toronto to Regina, and they didn’t even put us on our last flight, and didn’t confirm the rescheduled flight, so we were stranded, yet again. We barely managed to get someone to get us a hotel and food vouchers for the night, after another hour of searching through the airport. After we got home, we emailed customer support to only get compensated a couple hundred Americans airline dollars for our trouble. Our flight home got quintupled and all we got was a dinky little couple hundred dollars for stressed out flights, missed events back home, and lack of communication. Definitely not pleased with the service, and am highly not recommending this airline to anyone."
1519,"  Philadephia to Miami. We were supposed to leave at 8:10 am - after delay after delay we boarded the plane around 2:30pm after sitting in the airport for 8 hours. We got in the sky and about 2 hours into our travel. There was an announcement from the captain explaining that we have to fasten our seatbelts immediately because we would have to make an emergency landing in Fort Myers because they were low on fuel. Im not quite sure why the airplane would be low on fuel about 2 hours into the short trip! That is absolutely absurd! Shortly after that there was another announcement from one of the flight attendants stating that she knows we all have questions and she does not have the answers to in a very frantic voice putting us all In a very scared state. Im not quite sure what she meant by that because the answer was to get more fuel which seemed like an absolute lie or cover up of some sort. Once we finally landed in Fort Myers me and the 4 other people that I was with the 3 that were on the reservation with me, and a friend from another reservation demanded to get off of the plane because we felt  unsafe along with some other people that wanted off of the plane. We were told that we were not allowed off of the plane. Not only were we afraid for our lives because of the low fuel incident, we felt as though we were being held hostage. The captain and other workers were extremely rude to us and made us feel very uneasy! They even told us we are on our own when we got off of the plane after ripping up our tickets. After telling us that we were not allowed off of the plane and to take our seats we all demanded to get off. Finally, they let us off of the plane snatched our tickets and ripped them up. We had to pay for a rental car to get to the final destination Miami and drive for about 3 hours due to thunderstorms. We did not reach our destination until after 10:30pm. This has been a disaster! This was my first flight and not sure that I will be getting on another plane again. Our 2-3 hr flight turned into a 16.5 hour trip, more money spent on a rental, afraid for our lives, and an entire day lost! Our way home was on a Frontier airline and took us 2 hours and 5 minutes.! They gave us A $100 credit which will never be used! And no one was willing to take any responsibility! Customer service was terrible and customer relations was not trying to do a thing. They have taken no responsibility."
1520,"  Detroit to Dallas. Horrible customer service, even by management. The kiosk lines were long due to 2 or 3 kiosks being out of order. When I finally got to a kiosk and proceeded to check in, I had a quick question regarding my seat assignment. There were two agents standing near me at one of the broken kiosks, talking to each other, one of whom was a manager. He said “Just one minute”. After waiting 5 minutes, I just finished without assistance. He then came over to me and said “I’m here now”. I told him “that’s ok”. He proceeded to stand next to me while I waited for my boarding pass. I was clearly aggravated, but I didn’t say anything more to him. As I proceeded to leave, he loudly and arrogantly said “ have a nice day!” On my previous flight, I was assigned to an exit row seat. I’m tall, so I asked the agent at the gate for my seat to be changed to an exit row seat, if possible (same question that I had earlier when I was checking in). She wasn’t nice either. She said “yeah, if you want to pay more”. I said that I didn’t realize that because I didn’t pay anything extra for the exit row on my departure flight. The agent asked me if I minded taking it. She said, “well, it cost more money because people want those seats”. I am happy with the seat assigned to me. But, I expected much more from American Airlines."
1521,  Miami to Port of Spain. The in flight service was barely acceptable; the cabin attendant did what she had to do as if it were a chore. It seemed that she would have rather not come to work on that day. She wasn't impolite but her service was an attempt to demote American Airlines to a 2* carrier. The food was forgettable but that isn't so important to me. Cabin staff should be given the opportunity to fly on Middle Eastern and Asian carriers to experience high quality service.
1522,"  Albuquerque to Detroit.I will never fly American again. The attendants when you check your bag or board the plane are either rude or incompetent. I had a lady tell me I didn’t have to pay for my carry on because I was confused my ticket said group 9 and only one carry one. She told me they wouldn’t even notice and that I did not have to check it. When I got to the gate they made me pay $50 for a bag the size of my head! I told them the lady downstairs said I didn’t need too and they still made me pay a ridiculous fee. I’ve never had good customer service, they screw you on charges, and the planes are always delayed."
1523," Charlotte to San Diego. American is still the Wal-Mart of airlines. Aircraft was a bit dirty. Seating was tight. Aircraft appeared dated with no outlets and no TV/Entertainment system. WiFi was spotty at best. Boy, I am sure they can do much better than this. In short, American is still the Wal-Mart of Airlines, On the plus side, the flight was punctual, and the staff was pleasant. Food for purchase was decent."
1524,"  Cali to Montreal via Miami. Has to be one of the worst airlines ever! They always have issue either mechanical or maintenance related, they made us wait 2hrs on the plane before being asked to Deboard! After re-boarding getting near taxiing, the issues hasn’t even been resolved, flight attendance are rude saying” if you guys leave this plane, we’ll leave without you”. "
1525,"  Chicago to St Louis. It’s hard to believe this stuff still happens, but you can’t make this up. Into Chicago from Toronto early enough to catch a flight to St Louis 2 hours before my regularly scheduled flight. I look online and there are 16 empty seats on a 737.I have no checked bags. I get to gate before they start boarding. Desk attendant tells me to wait until all regularly ticketed passengers are through gate. After waiting, she calls me up and tells my my ticket class doesn’t allow me to take earlier flight. Ok, fine. I ask how much it costs and I’ll pay the difference. She’s says she can’t, go to American customer service where they can. Flight door still not closed. Service desk says they can’t, they won’t take my money, they won’t move me to an empty plane and free up space on my original flight that is fairly full. Anyone see why reviews on American are terrible and profits lag?"
1526,"  New York JFK to Los Angeles. An amazingly satisfying flight experience on an early morning flight from JFK terminal 8 to LAX. The take off of the flight was delayed because of rain and low cloud cover. The pilot kept us informed of the flight status throughout the wait on an active runway. The aircraft was clean, bright and spacious. The lie flat seats were angled towards the Windows. A duvet and pillow were provided as was an amenity bag. The entertainment system carried a large repertoire of current fils and TV serials. It came with Bose headphones. The seat was comfortable with several adjustment options. We were provided with hot towels on boarding and before landing. Breakfast of three choices were offered. The two flight attendants in the cabin were very attentive. Snacks served throughout the flight. A true first class experience."
1527,"  Rhode Island to St Louis via Chicago. Avoid American Airlines at all costs. Unfortunately, I seem to need to re-learn this lesson every year or two. Having been Concierge Key and Executive Platinum for years, I gave up on AA in 2014 because the service was Always Awful. Having been told flights would go then being cancelled. AA giving away reserved seats. Refusing to refund fare differences after being moved involuntarily from 1st to coach. Concluding AA does not know why we fly, I shifted to Delta and SW and have been Diamond and A-List for a few years. It’s amazing how much better the service is on Delta and even SW. Unfortunately, tonight I decided to give AA another chance so I could accommodate a business dinner in Chicago during a layover. I arrived at the gate 20 minutes before flight time to find that my 1st class seat had been given away as an upgrade to someone else and I’d been re-booked on the first morning flight. Eventually, after persistence with rude gate agents who told me to go find a hotel, I was put in coach and told to forget about a refund of the $1000+ fare difference. In the next bankruptcy, which cannot come soon enough, this airline should be liquidated."
1528,"  Seattle to Myrtle beach. Worst ever experience. I usually fly Alaska or United, but had to use American to travel to a conference. Flight from Seattle to Charlotte  is a 5 hr flight. No USB port or outlets for laptops, and no in flight entertainment. There was no food available to purchase. The flight was late and I had to run and catch my connection at Charlotte in the last minute. No help from flight attendants on getting off the plane quickly to catch the connecting flight which was leaving in few minutes. Return to Seattle (April 25th). 1.06 pm flight was delayed to 1.40pm. Then delayed to 2.10 pm (too late to get the connecting flight) at which point I am moved to a 4 pm flight to Charlotte to connect to Seattle through another flight (almost an hour standing in line - two separate times - to get the problem corrected). Sitting at the airport for last 3.5 hrs (total waiting - 5hrs) and hoping that rest of the flights will be ok. Will never fly American again."
1529," I chose American Airlines for my recent trips along the East Coast. I was doing the following routing: JFK-BOS-JFK-BWI-JFK. I must say that AA has become my favourite carrier for domestic trips. All these flights were on time, staff were friendly, I was checked-in within seconds, there was no hassle at security and without exception all flights were punctual. My best flight however was the one from Boston to New York on a transcontinental A321. I got a comfortable seat in the business-class section for this short 40-minutes-hop into JFK. But it was the captain who made this flight so special. As it was a clear and beautiful day he encouraged the passengers to look out of the window. And they actually did so. The Captain went as far as pointing out some sights en route and commenting on them. It was like flying in the 1980s when inflight entertainment on shorthaul flights was non-existent. After landing the entire crew - including the two pilots - stood in front of the cockpit and wished everybody a nice weekend. American Airlines provided a very personal and kind of nostalgic experience on this flight. I will not hesitate to choose them again."
1530," Houston to Dallas. Totally disappointed when flying with American Airlines from departure to arrival. They have too much trouble. The agent was rude. How do you feel when someone responded they did not need to tell you about your ticket so that they charged extra $25 in addition bag checked at gate because the ticket allowed bag under seat while you was checking another bag. And then 2 bags arrived at 2 different gate, 1 at B, 1 at C. I paid $85 for 2 bags."
1531," Montego Bay to Manchester (NH) via Philadelphia. Where do I begin? One disaster after another. 2 hr delay leaving Jamaica, not weather related. Plane had a ""mechanical"" issue coming in. When I questioned a flight attendant about the safety of the plane going back out was given a snotty sarcastic answer. Only offered one chance at water or drinks on plane 2 1/2 hrs into flight. Missed our connecting flight home, nobody cared stating ""the government "" took away their ability to compensate. No dinner. Was told we were booked on the first flight out the next day when in fact we were only on standby. Plane full. Next flight out is 3 1/2 hrs later. Missed work, added expenses, nobody cares. First and last time on AA. Can't go lower than a 1 on survey? They dont deserve a 1!"
1532,"  We were set to leave Miami at 9:45 pm on Sunday April 15,2018. We arrived early checked and one hour early to be on time, once it came time for our plane the flight delayed till 10:00 pm due to some rain - once 10:30 came around they said they were waiting on an pilot and a crew to fly in from Cancun whose plane was struck by lightning so they had to switch planes when they arrived, which was 25 minutes after the time they told us making it now 10:55 pm. 11:15 an AA representative got on the intercom to inform us that the pilot had flew his maximum amount of hours. We were ferocious to the fact they had lied to us and they knew that pilot had reached his limit for the day. They tell us to go to the customer service desk for food vouchers and hotel vouchers. AA tell us to return at 9:00 am for the next flight to Nashville, we arrived at 7:45 am only to hear that the plane left at 6:57 am - there was no update posted on the site nor did we receive a call text n- o type of communication alerts. Course the 9 am we was told got delayed till 10:15 and which there wasn’t any seats on it the last flight we had a scheduled seat for was at 9:18 pm once again they here we are in the airport at 10:00 in the morning and our plane leaves at 9 at night - they gave us another voucher for a room but it was hard to rest scared we would miss another flight, so around 1:30 we returned to the airport and sit."
1533,"  Minneapolis to Toronto via Charlotte. Due to an ice storm in Toronto, my connecting flight from Charlotte to Toronto was canceled (which I understood, and I support the airline in wanting to keep passengers safe). I admit that I was frustrated and worried because I was having trouble connecting to the CLT wi-fi to let my family know I was stranded (and I had never been stranded before), but even so, the lack of sympathy from the American Airlines staff was just staggering. The staff at the service desk talked more to each other than they did to me, and eventually handed me a scrap of paper with a 1-888 number for Travelassist and told me to go call the number. No empathy, no vouchers for food or shelter to help me along. And when I called the Travelassist number, they told me that all the hotels were booked and to call back in 2 hours to see if anything had come available (which is just as well, because I was so tired I gave up and booked a hotel through Expedia, and later found out that Expedia beat the ""distressed passenger rates"" AA secured by $15 per night!) When I got to the baggage claim to grab the bag I'd checked, it wasn't there, and when I asked the AA rep at the desk about it, he said that it could take 1-2 hours, and ""if my bag didn't show up in 2 hours, come back."" After an hour or so, my bag finally showed up. When I caught my rescheduled flight 2 days later, the AA staff at O'Hare were just as rude as the ones at CLT! I was not able to check in online for my connection, and only wanted someone to confirm whether I would be flying out that day, as I had a family member in Toronto waiting to pick me up and would have to message that person if I was delayed. When I went up to the desk at my gate, there was no-one there, but a young AA staff member was hovering nearby, so I asked him if he could help me. I was abruptly told by an AA crew member behind me that I had to wait for the gate attendants to show up. When they did, I went up to them to ask if they could help me, and was rudely told by the attendants (whose nametags were completely hidden by their scarves) to come back when they'd finished boarding the current flight. Other than the stewardess who grumpily loaned me a pen so I could complete my customs form, there wasn't a single American Airlines staff member I encountered who could be described as helpful, and none of them were kind or pleasant. I was a stranded student who had chosen AA so that I could come home from an academic conference a day early to save $350. Now, all the money I saved by choosing AA is gone because I received no vouchers, no guidance, no sympathy and no help. My first experience with American Airlines, which spanned multiple airports, showed me how rude, unhelpful and unsympathetic customer service people can be. And based on most of the other reviews on this site, I'm not alone in that discovery. I just wish I'd checked reviews before trying to save money - this was a painful and costly lesson to learn the hard way."
1534,"  Charlotte to Destin–Fort Walton Beach. Staff was rude and called the customer behind me a liar. I was unable to be checked-in because ""the computers go down"" 30 minutes before the flight and apparently I missed it by 5 minutes. I had only carry on luggage but was told there was nothing that could be done. Airline staff offered no assistance and then proceeded to get into a verbal altercation with the woman behind me. The level of unprofessionalism was unreal and I will never fly with American Airlines again."
1535,"  We purchased 2 first class tickets from San Jose to Aruba. Well San Jose to Phoenix to Miami to Aruba. All American Airlines and all purchased at once. On our way there the connecting flight from Phoenix to Miami (Phoenix layover) was very tight. Just under an hour. We made it ok. On our way back the layover was actually only about 30 minutes in that same airport! Our Miami to Phoenix flight was unfortunately 15 minutes late. And we discovered upon final decent (landing) that we were already 15 minutes past boarding time for next flight by the time that our plane was touching down in Phoenix! Our stewardess let us know this is a common problem for this airport and directed us to the AA magazine so we could familiarize ourselves with the airport and see which way we need to run. We waited for the airplane door to open, ran out first (since we were first class) and ran through the Phoenix airport from our arrival gate, two terminals away to departure gate. When we got there, the door was shut, and there were 5 other people there who didn’t make it from other connecting flights besides ours. Everyone was complaining considering the plane was still right there. It didn’t leave for another 20 minutes or so but it didn’t matter. Upon getting to the customer service line, as the group of us did, there were others there complaining about the same issue. By our turn all the flights to the Bay Area for the night we’re full. We were told at this point our checked luggage was here with us in Phoenix so we could get it and take their shuttle to double tree (with a voucher) though they didn’t offer us a food voucher. Once at the carousels to pick up our luggage, we were told our luggage had actually made the flight. Then we were told we should have asked for a food voucher and we should go back. At this point we were 15 plus minutes down the airport and we’re too frustrated to go back. When getting to the airport the next morning, we were told first class was full. The plane was full and we were not even going to be sitting near each other. So much for the extra money for first class! Horrible experience and customer service. Another thing is on one of our earlier flights, we watched the luggage being literally thrown mid air from a luggage cart to conveyer belt."
1536,"  Mobile to San Francisco via Dallas Ft Worth. The most pleasant trip I have had in years. Airbus with screen in back of seat was great for passing 3.5 hourflight time. Was surprised that games, tv shows and movies were free. What a departure from the nickel and diming. Seats had enough room for me to breathe. Overhead bins were big enough to hold carryon's. Our suitcase was 51 lbs (1 lb over, agent said no problem). Will choose AA if choice is available."
1537,"  Midland to Phoenix. Be aware that if you pay the lowest fare at AA you won't be able to use the overhead bins, only be allowed one carry-on, be the last group to board and not be able to select your seat until 24 hrs before departure at check-in. And from my personal experience they show only a few seats available for purchase making you think if you don't purchase a seat, you will be stuck in the middle seat even though when you board there are plenty of available seats."
1538,"  Grand Rapids to Vancouver via Dallas. After an absolutely horrendous experience with American Airlines and their garbage customer service with multiple missed flights, every flight overbooked and their ""not our fault. We had to de ice 8 times, good luck finding hotel room, though other airlines had no problem flying out did they? Their ""customer service"" counter is false advertising as they couldn't give a damn, and said ""nope we can't upgrade your seat because others require a fee and it's not our fault you missed your flight because our planes are old."" Then for customer service, it basically submit it to an email that's probably just marked as spam/delete so they don't take responsibility Try any other airline or walk even, American Airlines is garbage."
1539,"  Dallas to Minneapolis. Thank you American Airlines I've been sitting at the airport since April 13th, it is now April 14th at 9pm. I'm still sitting here I missed my flight this morning and there's a storm in Minneapolis so I can't catch a flight until tomorrow morning April 15th at 8 in the morning I haven't eaten since yesterday. I've asked if I could get a voucher to stay at the hotel for the night and the voucher for meals but you guys have told me no."
1540,  Miami to Rochester via Chicago. After my first bad experience flying American a few years ago I decided to try them again to get me home early from vacation to beat the storm waiting at home. Departed Miami on time and connected in Chicago to find out they canceled the one hour flight I booked 12 hours earlier to make it home to Rochester before the storm. Now I’ll be stuck here in Chicago for 2 days which will result in thousands of dollars in lost revenue for my business. Not to mention the checked bag they lost along the way as well. Thanks American Airlines for yet another disappointing experience. You should advertise yourselves as the last resort airline for those of us who may want to make it to our destinations. Another unhappy experience.
1541,"  Minneapolis to Miami via Philadelphia. Flight was cancelled the day before and I was told I needed to reserve seats on our new flight. Tried reserving these seats and it kept saying error please try again. Come to find out, I was charged every single time I retried to book the seat which left me with $1 in my account. AE was no help, was on the phone with them over 3 times to cancel the transaction and report the issue. They stated they'd cancel but that the money wouldn't be sent back to my account for up to 3 business days. And then when we were rescheduled to leave, they have maintenance issues and the flight was delayed over an hour. Our connecting flight took off 45 minutes after we were supposed to land so I brought this concern to the employee at the desk. He laughed and stated rudely ""all you Miami folks are nervous Nelly's. I need you to be patient."" And then when the flight was delayed again the worker asked another co-worker if she could help find the Miami connecting folks a different flight and she loudly stated ""I really don't want to!"" And they both laughed. Very unprofessional experience which has left me knowing to never fly American again. Weather/maintenance is one thing for delays (I understand this) however this whole experience is way more than the delay. It's the money I no longer have for my trip that American took out of my account and the rudeness and unprofessionalism of service."
1542,"  Washington DCA to Albany. I Purchased an economy class ticket. In doing so American stated that I do not have access to the overhead bin’s. I may only bring on a personal item that measures no more than 18x14x9“. Fine. I checked a bag. But nowhere on the American website does it state that any personal item that has wheels and a handle is not considered a personal item even if the measurements are less than required. On my flight, as I was getting ready to board I was basically held hostage before I could board because my personal item had a handle and wheels and that is considered a carry-on. Not only did I pay a baggage fee, I was assessed a penalty fee for a total of $60. If the website had stated that I wouldn’t have bothered purchasing an underseat wheeled bag that was under the size requirment. Any complaints through customer service resulted in a black hole stating they cannot go back on what the gate agent assesses."
1543,"  Jacksonville to Tucson via Dallas. This is a story about what happens when you are a Platinum Million Miler with American Airlines and you pay full fare for three first-class tickets for your family, booking through AAVacations and one of your family gets bumped by an air marshal. Spoiler alert: To stop you tweeting they mollify you with ""Our AA Vacations team will be able to help out with a refund once your travel is complete."" And once your travel is complete, the AAVacations team tells you they cannot issue refunds and sends you into a bureaucratic maze designed to punish you until you surrender. Here's the back story: First know that there were two marshals sitting in a 9-passenger first-class cabin on the dangerous passage between JAX and DFW. My petite wife ended up taking our displaced son's seat 20A because she was the only one who could fit into it--an unhappy way to start a $7K ""luxury vacation."" 20A is the seat opposite the aft cabin lav on a CR9 RJ900 aircraft. Her seatmate, a small elderly woman who also paid full-fare for a first-class seat, had been displaced by a second air marshal. More, so that the two air marshals could sit silently together, ever vigilant, one played poker and the other solitaire on their phones - my son and I were split up and placed as far apart as possible and still be in the same cabin. Having flown many millions of miles on many carriers, I suspected that not everyone in First had paid full fare for their ticket, so far in advance of boarding we asked the gate agent to look into the possibility of getting us back into our original seats, together three across. Subsequently, she managed to avoid my requests for updates until just before boarding when she advised that ""No one had volunteered to give up their seat"" and attempted to foist a $300 voucher on us as compensation, adding ""There's nothing else I can do."" Not true. When you do finally arrive at your vacation destination, American has managed to lose your bag. Now I understand that this happens, but how did they lose only one of the four bags we checked and why did it have to be my wife's bag? The following morning they delivered the bag to the Westin La Paloma, where we enjoyed a terrific week. The good folks at Westin took it upon themselves to make up for the lack of customer care and service from AA and AAVacations."
1544,  Asheville to Chicago via Charlotte. Do yourself a favor and fly another airline.  They try and make you pay to pick your seat if you are in basic economy or else they will assign you one. I choose to let them assume because on the app it said all available seats were for purchase. I board the aircraft and they have roughly 30 open seats and i am able to have an entire exit row. I land in Charlotte NC for my connecting flight and they charge me $50 to check my bag at the gate because I’m the last group to board and the overhead bin is full. Asheville allowed me to check my bag complimentary at the gate for an even smaller aircraft. The staff was incredibly rude and did not care that $50 is a lot of money for people. I will never fly this airline and neither should anyone else.
1545,"  Las Vegas to Dublin via Philadelphia. Very comfortable flight from Las Vegas to Philadelphia on the A321. The next leg from Philadelphia to Dublin was fantastic. Comfortable seats with AVOD plus non stop food and drinks service. Started with a hot meal which was great - I had the beef, then the crew came through with ice cream and then later with a hot pizza and cake combo. Flight crew were professional and friendly. Aircraft was clean and comfortable. I am appreciating the new American Airlines these days."
1546,"  I bought the ticket from American Airlines going Houston to Portland via Phoenix. At first the flight got delayed in Houston for 30 mins, then we still able to flight to Phoenix. However, at Phoenix they change the gate and didn't email me, I had to try and run quick to get to the gate, but when I get to the gate and scan my ticket, they say the ticket is invalid and somehow I got dropped from them - they don't even try to get me on the flight, I have the ticket already but they insist on getting me on the flight in the morning. I bought another ticket from Southwest and it was expensive. It seems as though the seat on my ticket was giving to someone else on the flight on American Airlines. Bad airline and would never go this airline again."
1547,"  St Louis to Los Angeles. Horrible service, very arrogant and useless from check-in all the way to the airline. I had problem with self checking, nobody tried to help. In the plane half empty didn’t let me and my son take our standard sized luggage. Service sucks Never fly any more with these guys."
1548," Akron to Birmingham via Philadelphia. Flight: 5243 March 23, 2018 from CAK to PHL First, we would like to thank the flight crew for their efforts to make a bad situation better and to resolve the unfortunate miscommunication with flight maintenance. Our understanding of the issue provided by the pilot was that there was some discrepancy with the flight maintenance log and that someone from maintenance would need to review and approve it before we could take off. The plane had been at the gate for over an hour before we boarded, and no maintenance was performed. We were informed that flight maintenance needed 30 minutes to resolve the issue, which turned into an additional 30+ plus minutes. At this point we have missed the original departure schedule but the crew was told it would be resolved in another 30 minutes and we could make up some time due to tail winds. Because of the delay sitting on the tarmac passengers were offered to deplane with the knowledge that they could not board again. Apparently, a passenger that only spoke Russian did deplane not realizing she could not return. She was very upset and in tears when she was allowed back on the plane, which, unfortunately impacted the departure time. At this point we had been on hold for more than two hours and it was clear we would miss our connecting flight from Philadelphia to Birmingham. Since there were no more flights to Birmingham that evening we were provided rooms at the Airport Wyndham hotel, comfortable at this point due to our exhaustion, but nowhere near a three-star hotel as advertised. We didn’t fly Spirit Airlines because of bad reviews, now we have one to tell regarding our experience with American Airlines. The situation seems like it could have been avoided with better communications and if flight maintenance would have done their required repairs before we boarded the flight. Lastly, “providing dinner and breakfast” does not mean vouchers that can only be used in the airport fast food court."
1549," Toronto to Dayton via New York. Every flight I’ve ever had with American Airlines has been delayed. This time my flight was delayed by 3 hours for “maintenance.” I understand that things happen, but I’ve seriously had a problem with this airline every single time I’ve flown with them. I’ve had enough, and I will never fly with them again."
1550,"  Orlando to Kahului. Customer service training must happen or happen more frequently. I have flown many times on business trips and with my family. I have never experienced what we experienced this trip. Our flight to Florida was okay. On our way back home, we were checking in at the Orlando Airport. A AA agent told us that we had to check in our Sit & Stand stroller. We told her that it was never a problem coming and all the past times we traveled. She said that at this airport, we had no choice and had to check it in. I went to ask another AA agent. I politely said, ""Good morning Maam"" to get her attention. She looked at me and said, ""Uuuggg"", you are the second person that called me Maam today! What do you want?"" I looked at her and said, ""I'll ask someone else"". Can you imagine the things you need to carry while traveling with two children? This made it very difficult to travel with two young children to say the least. When passing through TSA, we asked what the deal was and they said, it was okay with TSA. They check and allow any type of stroller. We got up to our gate and we saw one family on the flight before us who had the same exact Sit & Stand stroller and had no questions asked and strolled right into the jet way. I asked the agent, why the family before us was allowed and why we had to check our stroller in. She stated that it must have been missed. I found that hard to believe as another family checked in a double stroller (wider and more bulky than what we had). I looked around and noticed that we were the only family without our stroller.  When we got to Texas, the AA agent was so rude. We asked if our family could sit closer together. She asked for my boarding pass. Since my wife had it, I asked if I could show her a picture on my phone. She looked at me and said, ""I don't want to hold you phone. Phones are full of germs."" I didn't want her to hold my phone anyway, but what a thing to tell a guest. Phones could be full of germs, but you don't need to say that to a guest. There are many ways to politely respond and assume someone is giving you their phone to hold."
1551," Our flight was canceled because of snow-fine, no one can control the weather. The issue is in what happened after our flight was canceled. We were rebooked on a flight for the next morning, that would have taken us from NY to Boston, and then to Miami - a total of about 6 hours travel the next day. I called the 800# for AA to talk to someone about rebooking for something, anything that would get us into Miami that day, so we would not have to waste 2 entire days of our 5 day break (while also wasting hotel nights, and other things we'd planned). When I spoke to the person on the 800# she told me that there were no more flights leaving JFK, Newark, or LaGuardia, going to Miami that day. And maybe this was true for direct flights. I asked if there were any other options whatsoever, with flights going elsewhere that might then connect to Miami that day. She told me there were no other options. I asked, point blank, ""So you're telling me that no more flights are arriving in Miami for American Airlines for the rest of the day?"" She told me the only option was for this flight we had been rebooked. I then went to a counter to try to get on a standby list for an AA flight that was full, and going to Miami. Seeing a growing line of upset people, the attendant at the counter actually made an announcement that he could not help anyone who had been booked for the 6.45 canceled flight. I spoke to him anyway. I, again, asked if there were any options at all that would get us to Miami via American. He told me he was just too busy to help me. I'd like you to meditate on this for a moment: an AA service representative told me that he was too busy to help me, a customer whose paid flight on American Airlines for himself and his family to go away for spring break had just been canceled. We went to another AA gate for a later Miami flight to try to get on the standby list. At this gate we spoke to a gentleman. He was very pleasant, added us to the standby list, and then we sat. A few minutes later, he me up to the counter and said he could get us on a flight to Chicago, and from there we could pick up a flight to Miami. I was somewhat incredulous after a) being told that there were no options by the AA ""service"" rep on the phone, and b) being told that by another AA ""service"" rep that he was ""too busy"" to help me. So I asked him to confirm that we would have guaranteed seats to Chicago, and then to Miami. He said yes, and that we'd get in around 9pm. It worked-we made it to Chicago, then Miami, and ultimately only lost 1 day, arriving at our hotel in Miami almost exactly 12 hours late. But we did not lose a hotel night, and we did not have to reschedule anything else. This man saved our vacation. The rest of the AA staff and system is rigid, inflexible, and robotic, and do not try to help customers. They seem perfectly okay with unhappy, sad, disappointed and angry customers. Maybe they see it all the time and are numb to it. Maybe they need better training, maybe they take too much garbage from some customers who no doubt act like jerks. We did not act like jerks because we respect people trying to do their jobs. But we don't respect organizations that foster a culture where most staff clearly don't care about customers and only do the bare minimum for their jobs. We will never fly American Airlines again."
1552, Santa Ana to Phoenix. Those small airplanes are miserable to sit in. Smashed in those tiny seats. We always wait until the last minute to board but after boarding they announced we would be sitting in these crammed seats for an extra half hour. Would rather have shopped and walked around the airport instead. they knew this ahead of time. I have never had a good experience with American. Was very sorry I chose this but it was a short flight. Duped again by American.
1553,"  Phoenix to Denver. I will never fly with this airline again. After a few hang ups in baggage and security I was running late and ran to the wrong gate. My mistake, but once the gate agent and I realized the mistake she warned me i may not make my flight. I turned and ran to my correct gate ( same concourse) to arrive a be told doors were just now shut. The other agent did not call the gate and tell them I was on my way- a common sense courtesy. I was bumped to a new flight which missed my connection, bought myself and my toddler a motel for the night, only to arrive in the morning to be told I needed to purchase a new ticket in order to reach my final destination. All in all, horrible service, rude employees, and a very very cheap airline not at all concerned about customer satisfaction. "
1554," Hands down the worst airline I have ever flown on. Delayed the flight at least 7 times and ended up finally saying that the flight would leave at 930pm instead of 1040am. Which left me no choice but to rent a car and drive from North Carolina to New Jersey as I missed my connecting flight in Charlotte. Will never fly with this airline again. So a big thank you to American Airlines for forcing me to drive up the coast for over 9 hours, last minute, and ensuring I don’t get home until far past midnight. Do yourself a favor and avoid this airline at all costs. Also, in an attempt to appease the room full of people who definitely didn’t get where they paid to go, they handed out expired snacks. If I could give AA a zero out of ten stars I would."
1555,  Chicago to San Francisco. First and last time flying with this company. I was supposed to arrive in San Francisco today at 11:20pm and they rescheduled it for the next morning at 7:30am. No support at all about where my friends and I could stay or about the money we are losing and the people that work for them was rude. I don’t recommend this company for anyone.
1556," Buffalo to Charleston. I entered the system as an AAdvantage Member because they mentioned in shining lights that you get your 1st bag checked free. Needless to say that was only through one type of credit card - Citi Bank. So I had to spend an extra $50 on my checked bags there and back that I did not have. I only found this out when I had no choice but to check my bags, and spend that money. What a cheap cheating airline. Will never fly again."
1557," Atlanta to Chicago. Horrendous service at the ticket counter by an extremely rude employee. When filing a complaint, AA were not willing to provide a full reimbursement for our inconvenience nor did they apologize for the behavior of their employees. In other words, American Airlines does not treat their customers as the forefront of their company. As a frequent flyer, I will never fly American again."
1558,"  Charlotte to Las Vegas. The flight was late to leave, but today that is normal place. We take off for a cross country flight. The sole flight attendant in first class, seems to not have her wits with her today, but she remains pleasant. They serve drinks and offer a complimentary snack, your choice of two pieces of cheese and some grapes or three edamame pods floating on a wasabi colored mush of humus. I think sometimes their chef just feels like they have to be creative, and i am sure they won some fabulous airlines chef award for creativity. Comfort food, may not win the award but I bet customers would be happier. Then we went to use the AA entertainment system, however it appeared to not be operating. The partner of our witless attendant when asked if it was working barked a quick NO and kept walking. Not worth flying American. I wonder if AA Senior management ever flies their airlines to check on service"
1559,"  Miami to Washington. I had the worst customer service experience of my life today, which resulted in missing my flight with my husband and infant. We arrived more than 90 minutes prior to our flight out of Miami but were unable to check in via computer because my husband and child have the same names. We  paid for our baby to have his own seat which the computer couldn’t figure out. The airline doesn’t employ enough staff to have anyone to help with the computer kiosks, so we had to wait in a long, slow line to speak to a person. 45 minutes later, we dealt with an agent who was extremely rude and unhelpful. She said it was too late to check bags, so my husband had to leave the airport with our checked bags while I did my best with a long security line. I asked if I could be moved through quicker. One agent said yes and another said no. I wasn’t able to get rushed through, even though I informed security that I would likely miss my flight. I had to sprint through the airport to my gate with a crying baby, only to find that the gate had been closed. The attendant said she would “check to see” if we could still get on, but I saw her from the window chatting with other people while the plane started rolling away from the gate. I approached customer service about this and said I had to get back to the DC area tonight. The woman said there were “no available flights tonight” even though I found one online with a seat in first class. She didn’t even give me the option to pay extra for that. Thankfully I found a flight on another airline."
1560,"  My family and I had the misfortune of taking a connecting flight from La Guardia through Miami to get to Belize (a number of people on our flight were Belize bound, and others were St Thomas bound). We experienced one and a half hour delays on the day of our flight, first due to a problem by maintenance bringing the plane from the hanger to the gate, and then with baggage loading since we'd missed our scheduled boarding time. Though the pilot tried to make up time (45 minutes), American Airlines, knowing it was a flight full of connecting passengers, and that people like my husband were Platinum Executive, chose to ground us for 30 minutes because they'd made the decision to re-sell our seats after the mishap AA caused at LGA during our one and a half hour delay. It cause many of us to miss our connecting flights, which were the last flight of the day. Perhaps worse is that the pilot and flight attendants made announcements that those on our flight not connecting should remain seated because they were holding our flights. My kids and I ran 20 gates to arrive at our connecting gate 12 minutes before scheduled departure and were refused entry to the plane because the gate agent told us he had already sold our seats (we were meeting friends on the connecting flight who told us that they sold our seats 50 minutes before scheduled departure). What is worse is that we incurred many expenses by missing 24 hours of our vacation including hotel, tour group, private shuttle, plus hotel in Miami last minute during spring break. The airline has said they've officially classified it as ""Air Traffic Control"" even though the pilot repeatedly told us there was an issue getting our plane from the hanger (it didn't come from another city) and that there was a problem loading baggage. We never waited on the tarmac, except after we landed when he said AA didn't have a gate open. The airline treated us like prisoners and unethically chose to profit from our delay caused by maintenance and baggage in NY by re-selling our seats. I would not ever recommend an airline that makes decisions to screw over passengers in this manner. Its unethical and means bad management is at the heart of it."
1561,"  Recently flew from Bridgetown Barbados to Miami with American Airlines  to connect with British Airways  evening flight to LHR. I was on a very early flight from Barbados at 7am, on a late booking I got a basic economy seat which meant me having to pay $25US for a seat selection and $25 US for my checked in baggage to go in the under carriage. For an early flight I was hungry, yet not even offered to purchase/buy any snacks as advertised in inflight magazine. In general on a flight of around four hours economy class were offered 1 soft drink from a tray selection and a biscuit! The inflight team of four attendants, seemed quite unfriendly, captains announcements were miniscule. The legroom quite poor, only positive was I wasn't charged for the in flight entertainment. Generally a below average basic schedule on an airline which seems to have plummeted in customer satisfaction!"
1562,"  New York JFK to Raleigh Durham. American Airlines is a partner airline through OneWorld with Japan Airlines. I had to purchase a separate ticket with American to get to and from my final destination paired with a mileage ticket on JAL. Huge mistake. Coming over to the US on JAL, they checked my luggage all the way through to my final destination (RDU) and all was smooth. Returning to Tokyo, American Airlines refused no, matter who I spoke to. I was willing to pay for the luggage fees (despite being in business on JAL from JFK) and begged to have them check them all the way through. No go. After this, the flight up to JFK was delayed and the prognosis wasn’t good early on. While trying to get help from a gate agent for rebooking options, I was yelled at! In the end, as a seasoned traveler, I made had to make complicated arrangements to make sure I could get the following day’s connection. The terminal at JFK is substandard as well. The gates are far from the check-in and there are not enough TSA agents working. This is only the second time I’ve flown this routing from Japan to RDU and both times there was only ONE TSA lane open for the entire American Airlines terminal! People were going ballistic! In short, the customer service level of American Airlines is disgraceful and disgusting. Shouting at passengers, unwilling to check bags on partner airlines internationally, delays, and shabby aircraft all made for a horrible experience with them. I’ll never fly them again. I’d say it was like traveling in a developing nation, but even those countries have better facilities, aircraft, and customer service."
1563,  London to Dallas Ft Worth. I have been luck to fly with the latest Business Class product of American Airlines on Boeing 777.  Individual access on each seat. Awesome personal inflight entertainment. On board staff friendly and professional. WiFi was great. Catering was excellent.  I'd fly again with AA.
1564," Kona to Indianapolis via Dallas. The fiasco started in Kona with an initial 2 hour delay. The trip was to begin at 6:30 PM but did not begin loading unitl 8:30. Then we sat on the plane until 9:30 when we started out of the tarmac and began to taxi and the pilot came over and said the check engine light has came on again, we will need to return to the gate. 30 min later he advised us that United Airlines were in our gate and we were stuck on the tarmac. At 11:00 PM the pilot said we will give everyone an opportunity to deboard the plane, but within 1-2 min after the announcement the pilot came back on the intercom and stated they needed to do a quick engine test and that all passengers were to remain seated, only those in first class had the opportunity to deboard. Those passengers including myself who were still in the process of deboarding were directed back to our seats. Then at 11:45 the staff announced we have another problem, we sat so long we needed refueled but the staff put the fuel in the wrong tank making us unequally balanced, so fuel had to be taken out and placed in the center fuel tank. At 12:30-1 we finally left Hawaii, once at Dallas we had more delays, after missing 3 connections we then headed to a gate with a Chicago destination but unfortunately they did not put my girlfriend on the flight. We were waiting again, they then rerouted us to a direct flight to Indianapolis, we had to run to get there and once again we had a 3 hour mechanical delay. The trip is now over 24 hours and we were not served a meal the entire time, there were no vouchers given for the time inconvenience, no food vouchers as only snacks were offered in the period of 6:30 PM Sunday to 6:30 PM Monday with no time in between to eat a hot meal due to all the missed connections and literally running to the next flight to be only delayed again. In all this after many emails to customer service they only provided ""I'm sorry you had a bad experience, we hope we can do better the next time if you choose to fly with us again and offered only 15K air miles which is the equivalent of maybe $150, when I spent 100K air miles for this trip. Their defensive responses to emails were very inaccurate, unprofessional, condescending and overall poor customer service response was a perfect representation of how I was treated on the flights with American. The lack of a caring, empathetic, customer first attitude is rampant in American Airlines. I would be ashamed to treat people like jailed criminals stuck in an airborne jail cell, limited to a seat with limited movement and then given only a snack and a drink in a 24 hour period. AA is a disgrace to the industry."
1565,"  Flagstaff to Salt Lake City. Delta’s economy class has more to offer then American Airlines First Class. Let me put it this way, they don’t even have beverages to give to First Class except club soda and orange juice. No coffee, no tea, no snacks. No TV/video, nothing. No power plugs. Fly Delta, JetBlue or Southwest instead."
1566,"  Norfolk to Austin via Philadelphia. My first flight was delayed due to an ice sensor issue which made my flight take off get delayed from 6:20 to 7:55. My next flight was at 8:35 from Philly to Austin. My brother and I ran from gate F to gate C to try to make the flight after being told that it was not their responsibility to alert the Austin flight that we were late because of maintenance. When I got to gate 25C the two people are the gate didn’t acknowledge me so my brother said something and they told us to be quiet. They were so rude to us, I couldn’t believe it. Turns out they over booked the flight by 5 seats so they gave away our seats that we paid for because they double messed up. My brother is 6’4 and picked an isle seat because of his bad knees. They gave him a middle seat, but because of some kind passengers we were able to switch seats for him. I ended up sitting in the very back of the plane. When giving us our new seat arrangements, they wrote mine on a piece of paper and just quickly told him his. When he asked them to repeat it the lady told him to check his boarding pass because they were on there but she took his boarding pass. American Airlines acts like they’re above treating people like people; it makes my skin crawl. I will not forget how that lady looked at me with her smug face. I paid $500 for this flight and I felt like I didn’t matter. I will never fly this airline again."
1567,"  Los Angeles to Philadelphia. I don’t know where to start. I’ve become so disgusted with American Airlines lately. My husband and I travel very often. He’s Executive Platinum with American and travels well over 100k miles a year. I’ve been considering switching airlines due to the terrible customer service we’ve been receiving. We spend too much money to not be treated well. The last 3 trips we’ve taken have been hell. We had to call customer service multiple times to check in and get out tickets corrected. Every agent told us they were going to fix the problem but of course never did so we ended up almost missing flights because of it. Our return flight 3/29/18 was a disaster. We had a 30 minute delay leaving Philly so ended up missing our connection at 2:30. They put up on the standby list for one flight and also booked us for another flight. We ended up having to get on the second flight which was due to leave at 6:50pm from Dallas but ended up being delayed until 9:00pm. It was such a disaster. We lost our upgrade due to the delayed flight and having to switch flights. We had to travel 3.5 hours uncomfortably. We were suppose to make it back to LAX by 4:54 and didn’t return until 10:30pm. Ive about had it with American Airlines. If there not going to treat us right, then we will definitely be taking our money elsewhere."
1568," Delays Delays Delays. If an American Airlines flight is ever on time I'm looking for Ashton Kutcher. It never happens. I should have gone with my better judgement and flown United. As far as the flight goes, usually bumpier than competitors (landings). Service is moderately okay. Subpar pretty much all around. Book the United flight an hour after, thank me later."
1569," Flew American Airlines from Orlando to Albany. Upon getting my boarding pass for my flight I was told that I had to check my personal bag because I had a fanny pack, which goes around the waist so I don’t see what the issue was. Only had cash on me so I had to pay an additional $5 to get a card to use to check my bag. Then when seated on the plan an attendant rudely told a bigger male passenger that he should have had enough to fly first class for a bigger seat because his seatbelt couldn’t buckle. There were plenty of empty seats on the plane so I asked to move up into one as she was letting others do so and was told no. I was all the way in the second to last row 33b. I had the worst experience on that flight."
1570," When we tried checking in, my husband and I discovered that we were not seated together. I asked an employee who was walking around and her response was very rude and abrupt. FYI — the answer ultimately is you either pay more to sit together or take a chance of asking the gate attendant if they have any held seats for couples. Will not be flying with American Airlines again."
1571," Los Angeles to Narita. Main Cabin Extra - Was pleasantly surprised by American Airlines. This was my first time flying AA on a long-haul flight. Inflight meal was great. Shortly after take off, drinks and snack service followed by dinner then midflight snack of sandwich and oat bar then lastly, another hot meal prior to landing. Food amount for each service was adequate. Food tasted awesome. The IFE works really good. Response time is quick and tons of material to choose from. The legroom in the Main Cabin Extra is quite spacious. I can only imagined a 6’ tall person will be very comfortable in this section. The cabin itself was clean, neat and smells fresh. FA’s smiles a lot and very friendly and moves quickly during the meal services. The whole experience was truly amazing and will definitely recommend it to my friends and clients."
1572," I will fly Delta next time. Not worth the $200 I saved. Absolutely terrible service. I have received more ammenities and service in coach with other carriers. I was served a plate with hummus, nuts and and an absurdly small portion of crackers. I am allergic to nuts, so I asked to substitute the nuts for a second portion of crackers. I was told that was impossible. The attendant was curt and rude and hid in the corner playing games on her iPad. Wifi is not included and the gogo pay for play took over an hour to get sorted out on my devices. Totally not worth the time required, let alone the money. The plane also did not have any USB outlets or 110V outlets, even in first class! I just got off an Alaska Airlines prop plane that had outlets in coach! I will never fly American Airlines again. I recommend no one else waste their time with American Airlines either."
1573,"  Toronto to new York JFK. It was the day after the big snow storm that hit New York that left many flights cancelled. I was apprehensive that there would be no aircraft or crew to operate the flight from Toronto to JFK. My fears were misplaced. The plane was at the gate. The plane departed on schedule and arrived on schedule. It was a smooth flight and the flight attendant served beverages and pretzels. We had to drop off our larger carry on bags on a trolley on the apron before climbing the stairs on to the plane. They were promptly available at the top of the jet bridge at JFK when we arrived. Having cleared US immigration and customs at Toronto, we walked straight out of the terminal. This is what flying should be - on schedule, hassle free, competent crew."
1574," Flew Dallas to San Diego. American Airlines customer service has gotten worse over the past year, and it is unfortunate. This last trip, I had an issue with my luggage, which was my fault, but the customer service to help me remedy the situation was dismal. 5/6 people I spoke to in various capacities were all unfriendly, misinformed and not helpful. To make matters worse, I saw various other people throughout my adventure of acquiring my bags having a similar experience. Once lady coming to the US from Australia for a funeral had the bag-checker say ""give me the bag, we fly everywhere"" without tagging it, of course it was lost. In short, I would like people to know that American Airlines economy class is now comparable to Spirit Airlines in terms of accommodations and worse customer service."
1575,"  Terrible service. I am currently waiting to fly from Charlotte Douglas to Miami, which was initially supposed to leave at 11:55, but has yet to depart. It’s 4:15 and we are still unsure of our departure time. There was an issue with the plane, so understandably they had to find a new aircraft. However, since they resolved that issue, the pilot has been late, they have been unable to find flight attendants, and now - right before our supposed departure time of 4:25 - have to refuel the plane. Things happen of course, but the negligence and failure of AA to resolve these issues as quickly as possible is undeniable. This is also not the first time I have experienced significant delays on the airline. Furthermore, they have failed to give frequent updates to the passengers of what is going on as well as offer assistance to passengers with connecting flights. If you decide to travel with American, don’t expect to reach your destination at the stated time."
1576,"  New York to Montego Bay via Charlotte. American Airlines service is the worst. They cancelled my first flight (which took two days away from my vacation) then the day of my rescheduled flight they delayed my flight by 2 hours which made me miss my connecting flight, so now instead of reaching for 1pm, I am now reaching for 8pm. To make things worst they had us moving from gate 5 to gate 2 just to go back to gate 5. I hate American Airlines - first and last time ever booking with them. They are beyond unprofessional. You knew about this flight weeks in advance, why are you doing a maintenance check at 7:40 a.m."
1577," Flew American Airlines from Madison to Salt Lake City. The over booking of my flight made me miss my bachelorette party. They originally rescheduled me on a red-eye to arrive an hour before I was supposed to get married. The automated service which called only said “say yes to confirm” with no other option. I just said no because that was completely unacceptable. We had a reservation for our wedding at a specific time and we couldn’t rebook. Luckily the automated service understood the word no and took me to an unsympathetic person who did manage to book me to fly in around 1 am. My now-husband and I got about three hours of sleep before our wedding. Luckily my wedding dress managed to change flights and arrive with me, but the person I spoke with on the phone wouldn’t guarantee that my dress would arrive at the time we spoke, so I was very upset and anxious during the entire experience."
1578,  Washington to Boston. We fly regularly from Walter Reed to Boston for medical reasons for my husband. He’s a wounded warrior and uses an electric wheelchair. There were issues loading his chair. The ground staff told me he didn’t want his guys lifting something So heavy so they would let another crew put it on another flight meaning we would have to wait an hour without his chair after landing. Our captain went down to talk to them and they told him it was too big to fit. He told them he knew it would and it needed to be on the flight. He went out of his way to make sure it was loaded. When we landed he also made sure the ground staff brought the chair down the jetway which was something they didn’t want to do. He went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care. Our flight Attendant was also amazing and took great care of us. For domestic flights we only fly American Airlines because their flight staff is the best by far.
1579," Never flying American Airlines again. I took my boyfriend on a trip for his birthday and going to Florida (out of New York JFK) the employees were unnecessarily rude to multiple customers and then coming back (MCO to LGA) they were just as bad. First, the lady that was supposed to be helping guests on the kiosks completely disappeared for about 15 minutes which led me to ask someone else for help which then resulted in being extremely rude. We then almost missed our flight (even though we arrived at the airport about 2 hours prior to our boarding time) so we had to run to the gate. When I asked the flight attendant for water because I have asthma and couldn’t breathe I was denied it. Terrible customer service."
1580," I had by far one the worst experiences while flying with American Airlines. My flight was purchased from Raleigh to Miami, when I arrived I was told overhead space was full so they would have to check my bag in free of cost. After the lady placed the tag on my bag she said to me you can pick this up from Orlando. I explained to her it needed to go to Miami not Orlando, after her checking her information she explained to me that it might have been a ""glitch"" in the system and the only way I was getting my bag was to go to Orlando. This is absolutely asinine that I had to purchase a new ticket, the customer service is horrific. Clearly everyone hates their jobs and does care about the problems or issues you encounter while flying with them. Then on my flight back they could not locate my flight that my account was charged $400 for. The flight wasn't located but of course the payment was received. I had lost my phone on the trip and didn't have access to my email however, I was able to pull up the confirmation that was not found on there end with my payment attached. I spent together on one flight over $1000 for a mistake on their end claiming it was a ""glitch"". Honestly this made me never want to fly again the experience was horrible and customer service did nothing to facilitate the process I faced."
1581,  Charlotte to San Diego. Horrible airline. Awful customer service.  Rude staff. No empathy and annoyed if you ask them questions. Aircraft have always been filthy and this last one no upkeep on the plane itself. This caused us to sit on tarmac for an hour and led to us missing our connection. I will not fly with them again. 
1582,  I had an international flight from Zurich to New York JFK then La Guardia to Dallas Ft Worth. I have been kept in security and custom border protection for security and here in LGA that was humiliating. At the last moment of boarding I almost missed my flight. It was very humiliating and rude of them. Or is not my issue if the staff did not know that my boarding pass should get a stamp. They made me go back to security again and did not believe me. They are very rude disrespectful and incompetent.
1583,"  Jacksonville to Cancún via Charlotte. Gate agents at Gate C6 in Charlotte, as well as the flight attendant on flight 896, on March 17th 2018, went above and beyond to make my new wife’s trip to Cancun incredibly special. Their hospitality is second to none, and have single-handedly assured me to not fly another airline again. Their flexibility and attentiveness is something I will never forget. "
1584," Greensboro to La Guardia. The worst experience I had ever had. Our plane was supposed to depart at 5 pm, we boarded the plane at 9:30 to depart at 10:08pm. We boarded the plane twice and were asked to exit the plane twice. I don’t recommend this airline, especially if traveling with children."
1585," Impressed by how American Airlines is climbing back up from the bottom. Service on both legs was very good and the plane clean. The first leg Spokane to Dallas did not have in seat entertainment but the Dallas to Fort Myers did. There is food to purchase but the offering ran out very quickly, that could be improved. I would fly AA again. Compared with the major airlines in the USA this was as good as Delta and better than United."
1586,"  Paris to Dallas Ft Worth. American's New Premium Economy is excellent. I highly recommend the bulkhead seats. Excellent legroom, substantial seat width, great entertainment, and veery comfortable seats. Food, service, and amenity kit are just good, not great. The only gripe is minor that being the wine selection. It was pretty poor. Think jug wine. As this class of service is new, not much is written about it. On that note, I cannot stress how excellent and recommended the bulkhead seats are."
1587,  Philadelphia to Miami. This airline has horrible customer service. The staff are rude and treat their customers with a total lack of respect. They also have ridiculous carry on restrictions and made me check a bag at the gate that every other airline has had no problem accepting as a carry on. Worst airline experience I have had in many years and I fly about once a month (on other airlines). I won’t make the mistake of flying America again.
1588," Flew Houston to Cabo. First Class? Positives: more leg room, priority boarding. Negatives: seats filthy on all 4 flights and without cushioning, Wi-Fi didn't work on any flight domestic or international, no inflight entertainment to speak of at all. No outlets for phone charger, condescending ""attendants"". Never flown American Airlines before, and have had better experiences in economy seating. Will reccomend paying less with another airline and having a better flight."
1589," My first flight to Charlotte was delayed and hour and a half. Therefore, I missed my connecting flight to Akron. They automatically changed my flight to the following morning, however, refused to pay for a hotel. I had them change my flight to a different city for the same night. Right before I’m about to board, they “just received word that the plane just left it’s destination and so there’s a two hour delay”. Again, stuck in Charlotte until 12am, airline refusing to pay for a hotel and multiple flights with delays. Then trying to get an answer or solution takes about 30 minutes in their terrible customer service line. Staff are rude and they don’t do anything for you. I will never use American Airlines ever again."
1590," I was overly surprised and delighted by how comfortable and enjoyable this long flight with American Airlines was. The short sector from Las Vegas to Los Angeles was boarded quickly and a beverage service (bottle of water or juice) was provided. For such a short flight (45 minutes) this was a pleasant surprise. The sector from Los Angeles to Hong Kong was completely full but boarded quickly. The service on board was fantastic, catering has improved light years since my last international journey with the old AA in 2011. 5 spice Asian Beef in economy was a major treat. Non stop beverage services, all journey self serve snack buffet in the galley, hot pizza snack mid flight and large hot breakfast just before landing. Entertainment choices onboard are plentiful. Flight crew were very well groomed in new uniforms and professional, courteous and available for the entire 14 hour journey. I was sworn off of the old AA but I am so very impressed by what I experienced on the new American Airlines this week that I can see myself renewing my Admirals Lounge membership and coming back to American Airlines for my flying. Well done."
1591,  Ft Lauderdale to Reno via Dallas Ft Worth. Horrible customer care and bags delayed to boot. Then I would’ve had to wait until the next day for the alleged free delivery so I waited 3 hours for my luggage. Missed our first day of skiing and sat around tolerating rude gate staff. I stopped using American Airlines over 10 years ago due to lousy service and I guess I will make sure this time it’s permanent. 
1592," New York JFK to Port-au-Prince via Miami. I have never had such a terrible experience flying before. Before boarding they informed us that there was no more room in the airplane for our carry-on's and that they would take our luggage as checked baggage and said it was free of charge (of course since I didn't ask for it). Arriving at my destination no carry on! They only knew that my bag didn't make it on the flight, that it would be arriving with another flight they don't know when. I spent 3 weeks in PaP calling everyday going back in forth to the airport which was 45 min away from where I was staying. Terrible customer service, terrible communication. In the end they asked me to file a Customer property Questionnaire in order to get reimbursed for the lost bag. I filed it on the 3rd January, today is the 13th March, I’ve been calling their service long distance calls every other day to get no relevant information on my request. Well they've lost a client for good."
1593, Scranton to Salt Lake City via Philadelphia. I have to say how happy I am with American Airlines. I have been using this airline to fly my children from Utah to NY for several years. This weekend and 3 weekends ago I had 2 different incidents with my 15 year old. Traveling by herself it was alarming to hear she did not make her flights (both times). American Airlines went above and beyond to accommodate her to make sure she was safe and well taken care of. They arranged another flight for her and kept me posted each time. They took good care of her as well as myself (who as you can imagine was filled with worry). I will continue using them with the trust that my family will always be safe and well taken care of. 
1594, Denver to Boston via Charlotte. After we boarded. The pilot discovered that one tire needed to be replaced. It was only discovered after letting people in. This cause 30 minutes of delay. This is not the first time I get delayed when flying with American. And this will be my last flight.
1595, Flew Atlanta to Montreal via Charlotte. Flight was delayed for 3+ hours because American Airlines decided to schedule maintenance and make it a rolling delay and because of the huge delay I missed my layover in Charlotte and was forced to stay in a hotel after being at the airport for 8+ hours. Missed my first day in Canada while all of my friends were there because they weren’t stupid enough to think flying on AA is a ever a good idea. Never flying AA again.
1596,"  Miami to Baltimore. This is was my first time flying with American Airlines. I usually fly with Southwest and will stick to Southwest from now on. Everyone working at American Airlines was very rude. You can’t ask anyone a question without them getting smart with you. Baggage check in took so long and it was literally 5 ppl in front of me. They were working like they wanted you to be late for your flight. The baggage man got smart with me because I asked him 2 questions about my bags.  Worst customer service ever. Everyone acted like they hated their job, if your that miserable work somewhere else where you don’t have to deal with customer service! The only people who were decent were the flight attendants."
1597," Flew Phoenix to Chicago O'Hare. Was three hours early and waiting for flight. Quite unprofessional airport as no belt, shoes, or computer check, security just let us walk through a metal detector. As I waited at the gate many flights were cancelled because American Airlines flight attendants didn't fulfill work assignment. Several AA employees speaking unprofessionally at the gate and running around somewhat frantically. Then I hear my gate was reassigned. It took me 10 minutes to walk over there and the plane had departed. They didn't assure a seat on another plane, but assigned me to standby all day. No apology. No empathy. Just an entitled service as I must have been fortunate to spend my money with their airline."
1598," Nashville to Savannah via Charlotte. I bought two round-trip tickets to SAV, the flights to Savannah were great and we had no problems what so ever. The problem was on the way home when they pushed our connecting flight up by 40 minutes while we were in flight to Charlotte. I don't understand how the crew can make that decision to move a flight up by 40 minutes, meaning we missed our connecting flight which was also the last flight of the night at 11:15pm. When I called AA support she informed me that the plane didn't actually leave the ground until 11:29 pm and there is no reason they shouldn't have let us on the plane. She then said to tell the agent that we need hotel vouchers to which the agent said ""no sorry we can't"" and the representative on the phone was baffled at her response. All of us that missed our connecting flight were then kicked out of 2 terminals, no hotel, no food or water, offered to us. The AA agents in the SAV airport did provide us with snacks and drinks for our 2 hour delay so I was astonished that nothing was provided for a 12 hour delay. We were not put on another flight until 8:55 am the following morning meaning we had extra fees charged for storing our cars, missing work, and sitters. What makes me even more mad is I filed a claim with AA claims department and they sent me back the most ""we don't care"" email. Saying that AA feels that their customers should have to pay for extra cost such as hotels, transportation, parking fees, storage fees, and any other fees that we were charged for missing our flight due to the airline changing their times. I have never felt so disrespected by a company as much as I have with American Airlines. I was not asking for my full refund because 3 out of 4 of my flights were great and the crew was awesome except for CLT and the service I have been given so far. All I wanted was my extra fees reimbursed. Very disappointed with how we were all treated. I had booked all my upcoming flights with American Airline and have since cancelled every last one of them, I would never want someone else to be treated the way we were."
1599," Boston to Phoenix. Let me start by saying we travel a lot. We have never dealt with such rude and incompetent customer service in our lives. Over the course of two flights (roundtrip) we contacted American Airlines customer service about 7-8 times both over the phone and in person at the airport (customer service desk, gate agent) all regarding the same issue. They all gave us different answers and in some cases flat out incorrect information. We had issues with seats, with bags, but most importantly - when people are paying - any amount of money for that matter - you address their concerns in some way. After this awful travel experience we contacted their corporate customer service and got basically - sorry - can't help, fly with us again please. Even worse they clearly didn't even read the complaint. In the response they addressed the wrong issue and claimed I was travelling with my wife (I was travelling with my husband). Their lack of concern for customers is evident in the fact that they can't even read their emails fully. The whole process has just been incredibly frustrating - this business should be ashamed of themselves."
1600," 
Flew London Heathrow to St Louis via Dallas Fort Worth. Arrived at Heathrow early and since I had pre-printed my boarding passes was through Fast Track security in minutes. The American Airlines Flagship lounge, while not on par with BA's Concord Room, was quite comfortable with lots of food available, both buffet and from a menu. Boarding was a breeze. The seat was extremely comfortable with a wide variety of IFE available as well as WiFi. The flight attendants were extremely courteous and pre-flight drinks offered. Everything was on time. The food served was very good and these was plenty of it. The staff made frequent checks through the cabin for the duration of the flight. Flying from DFW to STL was also very comfortable with lots of smiles and frequent drink top-ups."
1601,  Philadelphia to Venice. Worst air company ever. No guarantees at all. They cancelled our flight for technical reason (ok safety is the most important thing ) but before that they delayed 3 times. The day after the same story. I had to pay for the hotel and they gave me only a 200USD to buy with a lot limitations another AA flight. Use a European airline so you are guarantee under CE 261/2004!
1602,"  Pensacola to Nashville via Charlotte. American Airlines will charge $50 to “help” you book your seats without informing you of the charge. That charge showed up on my card but they never processed my seat purchase so my seats were cancelled. When I called customer service, they refused to reinstate my seats. Refused to refund my $50 and were not apologetic."
1603,"  Orlando to Gatwick via new York JFK. On arriving at Orlando (MCO) to check in we were informed that our flights to Gatwick (LGW) via New York (JFK) was cancelled due to bad weather (snow), the AA representative was very abrupt and unhelpful with regard to our situation with two young children and elderly person with health problems. We were rebooked onto a flight via Charlotte to Heathrow entailing a 14 hour wait at MCO airport with no assistance with hotels or food offered and virtually abandoned at the Airport by both AA (and BA with who we had made the booking). By the time we were able to check on availability of hotel rooms we found that there were none left. No suggestions or assistance had been offered but we made the decision to split our party into two and were able to obtain slightly earlier flights for the children and their parents but this still involved a nine wait for a connecting flight at Chicago and arriving at LHR instead of LGW. We will never be flying with AA or BA in the future after this experience"
1604,"  I flew Raleigh to Miami on a B737-800. On check in and bag drop at Raleigh l had TSA pre - check on my boarding card which meant l didn't need to remove laptop etc from my carry on , through security in a couple of minutes. The flight had been brought forward 30 minutes then put back 90 minutes , not a problem and l received text messages about the changes. I had extra leg room seat and the flight was completely full. Drinks and a biscuit thing were served, I asked for coffee but never got it, perhaps she couldn't understand my accent. No IFE just screens showing some moronic TV show."
1605,"  On my recent flight from Yuma to Phoenix I noticed an older lady who requested a wheelchair. I noticed her mostly because she kept crabbing at her elderly male companion. Honestly, from his walk, I would say he was the one in need of assistance. Later on the plane I was seated in the exit row. The plane was not full and apparently this lady and her companion were not seated together. The aisle seats in the exit row were both open. This pair moved into these seats. I fully expected the flight attendant to make them move because someone wheeled onto a plane is obviously not physically capable of helping anyone in an emergency. She did not. While I'm not a body builder, I am capable of lifting that 45 lb door and assisting others. These two obviously are not. And more importantly, they were seated perfectly to be in the way of anyone trying to save themselves. I didn't speak up, perhaps I should have."
1606,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Tampa. Worse experience ever, as long as I can me and my family will never used this airline again. We were flying from Vegas to Dallas FT Worth then from there to Tampa they delayed our fly three times, so when we got to Dallas we missed our connecting flight. They were not helping good enough, gave a hotel room for that night but they got us vouchers for taxi which we have to wait outside with very cold weather. We finally got to Tampa the next day thinking the worst Was behind - found that my suitcase was missing - we learned the next day the someone walked off with my suitcase. I hold them responsible for this. I will never recommend American Airlines."
1607,"  Phoenix to Yuma. The man in seat in front of me was in row 1 of first class (It was a very tiny plane and the upgrade was only $59 so I was treating myself). Passenger 1 was jovial and talkative and showed me a paper cutout of ""Flat Stanley"". (http://www.flatstanleyproject.com/) He was taking photos and videos of Stanley everywhere for his 6yr old daughter. While we were waiting to leave the gate, I heard him talking and asked if he was talking to Flat Stanley. He said that no, he was taking a video of him on the plane for his daughter. One of the stewardesses yelled at him to shut it off. He asked why and explained that he was videoing this doll for his daughter. She was rude and demanding and made him shut off the camera saying he was not allowed to video staff. (Is that even a thing? I can't imagine it's a thing). The passenger complied but was talking to us other passengers and commenting when she was around that she was violating his rights and she might not have a job after he talked to the airline. I said she was probably having a bad day and he should just let it go. When we landed, the doors did not open. A man came up from the back of plane. He was dressed plainly. (jeans and a long sleeved t-shirt, I think it was.) I saw handcuffs hanging from his belt on the small of his back. He stepped into the cockpit with cranky stewardess and shut the door. The next thing I know, ""officer"" is demanding me to get out of my seat and making me stand in the aisle by the stewardesses. It is important to note that he did not identify himself to me or show me a badge. He ordered me around and informed Passenger 1 that he needed to sit there and me to wait. I asked the ""officer"" if he needed me as a witness because I saw it all and this was a horrible misunderstanding. He didn't want to talk to me and did not want my info. I could tell this was looking very bad for Passenger 1. I hastily wrote my name and number on a piece of paper from my purse and gave it to Passenger 1 and offered my help if he needed. When I was told I could deplane, Passenger 1 was still being held inside, He asked if he could take my picture so he could text it to his family so they could find me to let them know what was going on. When I deplaned there were police outside talking to the captain. Turns out, the stewardess said that Passenger 1 threatened her! I was shaking I was so angry at the lie and the injustice. I gave the officers my information and told them what happened. I waited in the airport and Passenger 1 finally came out. He was released and the officers told me all was dismissed. I cannot express strongly enough how angry and horrified I was that in United States of America, we were badgered and pushed around (By a man who did not even bother to identify himself) all because some American Airlines stewardess lied about a passenger and could have caused an innocent man to be on a do-not-fly list or worse, go to jail. To this day, I do not know Passenger 1’s name. He was a stranger to me. But he was unjustly detained and put at personal risk by American Airlines and I hope all is well with him today."
1608,"  San Francisco to Asheville via Charlotte. Worst experience ever. Spent the day flying from San Francisco to Charlotte, NC, hung out in a restaurant for my three hour layover, then showed up at my gate for my one hour trip home. Gate was moved. Went to the new gate, 2 hour 15 minute delay! I could drive home and get there sooner, except they can’t give me my bags for over an hour. If they had simply told me it was delayed via email before spending three hours in a restaurant waiting on my flight, I would’ve rented a car and would be home right now, instead of in this miserable airport waiting on another 1 1/2 hours to pass (at this point). My wife and I each have AA mileage cards, and you can bet my first order of business when I get home will be to cancel those suckers."
1609," My friend and I flew from Heathrow to Raleigh NC on a B777. Check in at Heathrow was very smooth and we were through security etc in less than ten minutes. Boarding was quick and we left on time. We had double seats row 36 but there was plenty of room to move if required. Food was good and drink runs frequent as was rubbish collection. My friend had never flown trans Atlantic before and she was very impressed with American Airlines. IFE was also very good.
"
1610," Flew American Airlines from Santa Ana to Philadelphia via Dallas Fort Worth. I missed my scheduled flight and had to rebook, the representative at the airport put me on standby for a flight several hours later, telling me that I would ""probably get on."" However, the flight was full, and after waiting around for over three hours I rebooked for the following day. I arrived at the airport two hours early this time, only to find my first flight had been delayed by two hours. I received a message on my phone that this might cause me to miss my connection in Chicago, so I attempted to change flights via mobile website. However, upon submission it displayed an error message about the action not being completed. So I decided to wait, hoping the delay wouldn't make me miss my connection. Unfortunately, despite what the online booking told me, they had in fact given my seat on the first flight away. The attendants were very helpful and I was able to get onto a flight to Dallas Fort Worth, where I could pick up a connection home. But this new flight was full enough that I was required to check my carry-on. The flight was fine but when I arrived in Dallas, I found my connecting flight wasn't for another hour. I settled in to wait, but after only half an hour or so, it was announced that the flight had been delayed by two more hours. And because I was forced to check my bag, I had no way of changing to an earlier flight. The staff were nice enough to put out some drinks and snacks, but I'm unsure of whether that was organized by American or by the airport. The second flight had no in-flight entertainment or even an outlet, though the staff were pleasant. Overall not a great flight experience. I don't think I will be flying with American again without having done some thorough research first."
1611," Flew London Heathrow to New York JFK with American Airlines. Check-in was fine and thanks to status I could use the good Cathay Lounge. Boarding was slow because everyone was being asked if they wanted to check in their carry-on as they scanned in. We had two seats in Main Cabin Extra, bulkhead. The big problem was that AA did not have any bassinets so the aisle passenger, not in our party, had to hold the baby. She was fuming because she asked at check in to make sure it was there. It’s hard traveling with babies I know but she really did encroach on my space the whole way. My fault gambling on the bulkhead. Flight attendants went through the motions but didn’t care much. Barely visible. School holidays so not cheap for an unpleasant 7 hours."
1612," Flew American Airlines from Denver to Dallas. I have been a loyal American flyer for over 10 years. I only book American flights. Somehow this time not only do my husband and I get charged for a carry on, we also had separated seats on a full flight. Now I put American on the same low level as all the others. Very disappointing. I was a very loyal customer but no more."
1613,  Miami to St Croix. If I can rate a negative number. I would. Flight was at 5.45pm. We were checked in at 10am. Sat for 7 hours with no notification on a gate change. Rudest gate reps we have ever dealt with to the point that they were bold to comment go ahead when i said i will be calling corporate for their negligence as we are left stranded till the following morning. Customers will seek alternate airlines when employees portray such mediocre and nonchalant behavior.
1614, Flew American Airlines from Kansas City to New Orleans. This trip is the worst experience on a flight I have ever had. Due to an error with the fuel our flight was three hours behind and I then missed my connecting flight. Some staff were apologetic but others were rude. I am spending more time flying that if I had driven.
1615," I arrived at the airport in Tucson at 4.45 am in time for a 6.15 am flight. AA302. Too bad the flight crew decided not to get out of bed. Took off 1.5 hours late and landed in DFW just as my connecting to IAD was leaving. I was rebooked on a flight 4 hours later, in economy, despite having a first class ticket. Then, that flight (AA1544) was delayed due to a ""mechanical issue"". I landed at 7.15 pm eastern, despite getting up at 3.30 am Arizona time. A 14 hour day just to get from Arizona to Washington. American Airlines has no business being in business."
1616,"  Austin to Los Angeles on a Boeing 737-800. Arrived 90 minutes early, with TSA Pre-Check, cleared security in a 2 minutes. Austin Admiral Club staff is still the best. Always nice, accommodating. Small enough lounge, they remember frequent visitors. Flight boarded on time, group 4, for main Cabin Extra. Extra legroom makes economy travel much more comfortable, especially with an empty seat next to me. 3 hrs in the air, 1 round of drinks and snacks. I always order a coke zero and a tomato juice, yes weird combination, but never an issue for the flight attendants. Personal device for entertainment which was fine. Landed early and as usual at LAX you wait till your gate opens up. So arrived at the gate on schedule. Satisfactory economy trip."
1617,"  Charlotte to Miami. Agent made me check my bag. He told me my bag was too big. (Although it was smaller than the average carry on) He also told me their was no room on the plane. (Although he hadn't been on the plane) The guy that did it acted rude and spiteful. When I told the flight attendant she was confused how he could've even known. I've always flown American, however, this individual makes me want to try another airline."
1618," Arrived 1 hour prior to flight from Tampa to Chicago. Waited in line to check in for 15 minutes when I was told I could not check my bag because it was too late. I told the lady I would have my wife pick up my bag and ship it to me over night. In the 15 minutes it took my wife to come back we then tried to check in and were told we missed out flight due to a 30 minute check in requirement. Then we were told the next flight they would put us on was 8 hours later even though I offered to pay more to get on one of the many flights leaving much sooner. Had she told us about the 30 minute cut off to check in I could have checked in while waiting for my wife to return and been on my flight. Overall this is the worst experience I have ever had traveling by air and caution anyone booking a flight with American Airlines. Remember, you get what you pay for. I have learned. Next time I will pay more and fly Jetblue or Southwest."
1619," Flew Dallas to Chicago. American Airlines continues to be the most inefficient airline I have flown. More frequently delayed than other airlines and often say the overhead bins are full amd make you check your luggage, yet when you get on the flight, there is tons of room. They also seem afraid to acknowledge customers concerns. I will avoid them at all costs in the future."
1620," Flew London Heathrow to Chicago O'Hare, on new B787-800, and based on previous reviewers of American Airlines, dreading the trip. I have rarely been so pleasantly surprised. First flight out of Heathrow, and biz class, due to no First Class on this airplane I had a seat on my own, which was great. The AA biz seat isn't anything special per se, in a global context, but is certainly vastly superior to British Airways Club Class, and even better than British Airways First Class. Food was acceptable, slightly better than mediocre. The purser handling Business Class was excellent, and had the correct balance of professionalism, and personality to serve a Premium Cabin. The aircraft itself is still quite noisy, compared to an A-380, but it seemed to deal with mild turbulence well. So, compared to British Airways, I have to commend American Airlines internationally, (although their USA domestic product is still woeful). I will endeavour to fly American Airlines B-787 business and first class internationally over British Airways, given the choice."
1621,"  Chicago to Minneapolis. Delayed because of technical/mechanical problem. In the last 6 months, I have traveled 5 times with American Airlines and every time flight got delayed because of so called technical/mechanical problem, One time i had to miss my international connecting flight because of this same American Airline flight got delayed. I will try to avoid travel with American Airline in future, they are the worst airline. I am very disappointed and very unhappy with American Airline, will try to never travel again with them. "
1622, Due to fly American Airlines from Fort Lauderdale to Houston. Poorest customer service I've ever received from an airline. Flight delayed which caused me to miss connecting flight. Stood in line for hours to try and reschedule due to urgent need to get back home but ended up stuck in airport for 14 hours and all agents dismissive and even rude about questions or concerns I had. Will never fly with this airline again as long as there are any other options. Very disappointed!
1623,"  Phoenix to Portland. Horrible customer service, a poor website that wouldn’t let me check in! I show up early and the put me at the end of plane. Then they sit us on the plane for 45 minutes before sending us a text message saying we’re delayed another half hour. I mean can’t you come over the loud speaker and tell us the truth?  After waiting over a hour in the plane they finally decided to tell us that the landing gear is damaged and we would have to roll back and wait while they check for leaks. I’m glad I’m safe but they should’ve taken us off this plane instead of torturing all of us and never disclosing the information when they knew damn right it was gonna take all night. I’m still on board waiting now. It’s been hours."
1624," Flew American Airlines from New York JFK to Charlotte. They charged me for a carry-on and then tried to charge me for an extra piece because I had a tripod strap to my carry-on. I will never fly them or anybody else who charges for carry-on luggage again. They were rude and I will be sure to let all my friends, family and colleagues know about this."
1625," Flew Miami to New York City. First time in economy in the new 737MAX. Seat pitch was fine, couldn't tell it was reduced from 31"" to 30"" as the seat is thinner. Comfort of the seat was very good for the 2hr and 30min flight. Power outlets at every seat, separate USB also at eye level which can be used for charging. FA's were really nice and pleasant, full can of soda and cookies or pretzels. I really appreciated the female FA who politely ensured that everyone's seat back was upright before takeoff and landing. Left on time, arrived early. Luggage was already out when we got to the belt. Competitive pricing. Honestly I think American Airlines is doing a great job. If you are a member of the Admirals Club, the lounges in Miami are great."
1626," Flew American Airlines from London Heathrow to New York JFK. Greeted by friendly and helpful staff at Heathrow. Plane was practically empty so myself and my mother had a row each. Cabin crew were polite, helpful and respectful. Food was tasty and filling, even the dairy free meal was appetising. Seats were comfortable and reclined well, legroom was more than enough for 6’1”. Would definitely fly again."
1627," Flew Las Vegas to New York JFK. A very comfortable day time flight on a beautiful day. The pilot/copilot described the flight path while we were on the ground and alerted us to what we should look out for. I was thus lucky to be in a window seat. The tour guide role the cockpit crew played was excellent. A breakfast meal was served. Later on, snacks, soft drinks, hot drinks, and liquor were offered. Although the business class cabin was full, it was spacious and quiet. Flight attendants were attentive. The cabin had drop down TV monitors, no movie selection was available though you could choose from a range of music channels. Seats were wide and leg space ample. It might have been more relaxing if there were foot rests. We were kept informed of the progress of our flight including any holding delays near JFK. I found all this information very useful. Another well run flight by American Airlines - on time departure/arrival, helpful and informative staff, a decent meal and snacks, and clean cabin and lavatory. Given the many negative comments about the airline, it appears that there is a great deal of inconsistency in their service, in the training of their airline, and by aircraft and route. On this trip at least, I had no issues at all."
1628," Flew San Diego to Philadelphia. I've avoided American airlines at all costs and only fly with them when my company books my travel. They are the worst in customer service. The plane is clean but my flight had no entertainment available. No big deal for me, but a 6 hour flight should have a plane with something. Forced to check my roller at the gate due to space availability, get on the plane and there's tons of space. That annoys me to no end, and they just don't care about your personal belongings (whether you receive them and the baggage claim). I hate American Airlines, from the first time they lost my bag with my most important belongings, then gave me the run around to avoid helping me retrieve my bag or reimburse me. I see nothing has changed."
1629," Due to fly Des Moines to Charlotte. Over 5 months I have flown American Airlines 9 times. Every flight was delayed due to ""mechanical issues"". 4 of those flights had no working restroom. I own several older vehicles that run better than AA planes! My confidence in this airline is so low I am seeking other airlines and paying more to get on planes that work. This cannot be coincidence that only the planes I am flying are like this. As I write this, my flight is delayed. Mechanical issues. Cannot wait to get in the air so we can test AA's equipment with several dozen lives on board."
1630," American airline employees are liars and rude. They took off 45 minutes late as Phoenix was telling them to since the airport has only one operable runway. They said it impacts all flights, so in theory our connecting flight would be delayed as well. After running the entire length of the Phoenix airport and getting to the gate while the plane was still sitting there and the door to the plane was still open, they would not let us board the plane. Rip off airline! Use another airline!! They make you miss your connection and act like they didn’t do anything wrong. Save yourself and your vacation from dealing with them. They have no idea about customer service. "
1631, Due to fly Atlanta to Dallas Forth Worth. I will never fly American Airlines again. Terrible customer service on the phone and in person. I completely understand them being a billion dollar company and not caring about my little money but to be rude and not helpful is another thing. Rep told me I don’t care if you want to fly with another company. Why would you push a customer away? I will rather pay more to fly with someone else.
1632,"  I warned my travel party before we left that we should not fly with American Airlines since I had so much trouble in the past. I have never been so right. Our first flight was delayed and my daughter and I ran to catch our connecting flight. We made it in time and I told the ticket attendee that my mother who is 66 years old was right behind us with my sister. The reply I got made me see red. The attendee informed me they had one minute and forty five seconds to get there. Then she informed me we were all ""degated"" and she had a volunteer she was going to seat. 1 minute 45 seconds has not expired yet and she says the door is closed and shuts the door. Right as my mother and sister arrive. Next flight is 6 hours later putting us at our destination at 1030 pm. So having all this time at the airport, I decided to write a review."
1633," 
I just had the worst customer service I’ve ever had with an airline. American Airlines customer service at Philadelphia International Airport has totally gone to pot. Now you not only have to tag your own bag and put it on the conveyor, but you have to put up with some of the rudest counter staff in the airline industry. After I tagged my bag, I went to weigh it and the woman asked for my boarding pass and ID. I held it out for her and she asked again for my boarding pass and ID. I said here it is, and she said again boarding pass and ID. She would not take it or ask me to display it, she just asked for boarding pass and ID. So, I separated them and she said OK. She didn’t get a look at the ID, just saw that I had it in my hand. I could have shown her a library card as far as she knew. Then at the TSA, when I walked up to the Kiosk and held out my boarding pass and ID for the woman there she didn’t take it, she pointed to the front of the kiosk where she wanted me to stand without saying a word. I fly into PHL often and this was the worst customer service I have ever had at any airport. When you are paying a thousand dollars for service on American, you should get a polite a courteous reception. I remember when flying meant great customer service, but now it seems like you really don't want us here."
1634,"  Midland to Lafayette via Dallas. This was the worst flight I have had. An older female stewardess berated me in front of everyone twice, once for not knowing it was not free seating like my pleasant flights on large Southwest aircraft, and again when I asked what type of cookie, she rolled her eyes and tried to shove it at me, very rude. The next flight the male steward called me out on overhead mic cause I had to use restroom."
1635,  Dallas to Memphis. I was having a hard time booking my flight on my laptop and the employee at DFW ticket counter went out of his way to help me get my flight booked. I tried to give $20.00 for all his help I insisted he take the money. He told me he was happy to help me. I was able to make it home with his help. It is great to have people who care about the customers and go the extra mile for them. Thank You!
1636,  San Diego to Kingston via Miami. Terribly disappointed as American Airlines continues to give a downward spiral in service delivery - after taking them to San Diego and return it is now clear that they see the Caribbean as not a key customer base. These first class tickets were a complete waste of Money no lounge access and very aloof agents in Miami international who were quite proud to say that the Caribbean Market is not where their focus is. I will be spending my money with other carriers - bye bye American.
1637,"  Dayton to Jacksonville via Charlotte. I had found trip tickets for 2/5/18 and this had to be the worst experience flying I could have imagined. My first flight was fine but when I reached Charlotte I was informed that my connecting flight was delayed so much so that it was going to ruin my plans to see my husband who is active duty military. I was able to switch flights to land in New Bern NC rather than OAJ, but then I had to rent a vehicle to drive an additional hour to get to my destination. In the midst of all this my flight back to Charlotte was delayed 4 times and my time with my husband was spent trying to figure out how I was to get home now since my connecting flight (last flight of the evening) was now going to be missed leaving me stranded in Charlotte. I only ended up getting to spend 1 hour with him and I do not know when I will see him again...i drove to the airport in hopes that I could get a connecting flight home but there was none...so I took the flight I had from OAJ to Charlotte and had to get yet another rental to drive 7.5 hours through the night to get home in time to head right back out to work. It was the worst day and it's almost impossible to get anyone to assist with any kind of refund. What was a $500 trip ended up costing well over $900. Will never fly this airline again."
1638," Flew New York JFK to LAS Vegas with American Airlines. Was upgraded to first class on this domestic non-stop flight. Plans pushed back on time but had to be deiced because of incoming snowstorm thus delaying take off. For the most part the flight was smooth and we landed only a few minutes late. A breakfast was served - there were two choices. Drinks and snacks were regularly offered. Our coats were taken and hung up. The flight attendant serving the cabin was efficient. The wi-fi did not work. There were no personal entertainment screens. One needed to stare at a wall mounted screen, cheap head phones were provided. Ample leg space but the seat did not recline. Bathrooms became untidy towards the end of the flight. In sum, it was a reasonably comfortable flight but would not pay first class fare for the experience."
1639," Flew from Charlotte to San Francisco. Although I wasn´t expecting too much from American Airlines, I have to say that this time everything was fair enough. Nothing outstanding, but everything worked well. Perhaps service was somehow rough. Food and beverages were ok. The aircraft was old and worn. Ground service was bad and impersonal."
1640," Where do I even begin with this airline? I could start by saying I will never be flying with them again. American has not once, but twice lost my infant car seat, stroller, and base when flying with a 5 month old baby. My most recent flight I had checked my stroller, car seat and base at my gate, when I arrived in Dallas for my layover it was nowhere to be found. When I asked for assistance it seemed that no one working for American had any idea what they were doing. One gentleman unloading baggage was trying his best to help us by calling his supervisor who took 30-40 minutes to even answer the phone. We got sent back and forth between employees who didn't feel like dealing with us and told us things like ""I honestly have no idea how to do this"". ""Baggage claim isn't answering my calls"" and things like ""You are going to have to go back to the gate you came from I don't have time to deal with this"". The most frustrating moment was when the supervisor finally showed up 40 minutes later, meanwhile I am holding my sick, hysterical child on my hip in the airport trying not to miss my next flight that leaves in 30 minutes. The supervisor drives past us in a baggage car, not even stopping saying ""you are going to have to call baggage claim and see where it is, I don't know what to tell you, it must be lost somewhere"". It was the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I was then told to go to my next gate and wait there so I didn't miss my next flight. So I carried my child to the opposite end of the airport with no stroller and no extra hands to carry my personal items. When I arrived at my next gate and told the new American employee what was going on she responded by saying. ""Oh, you're going to have to go back to the gate you came from. That isn't in my department since you came from a different gate"". So extremely frustrating! I then proceeded to ask the employee how she expected me and my child to get home from the airport with no car seat or base when I arrive at my final destination. She then stated that I can file a claim with American and ""maybe"" they will supply me with a used one to get home from the airport. $250 later my husband had to meet me at the airport, 2 hours from our home with a brand new car seat and base we had to purchase so that we could safely leave the airport with our child. When we arrived at our final destination we were then told our baggage had never even left the first airport we left from. American Airlines stated if they could find our items they would send them to our address. Two days later an American airline employee shows up at our house at 1am with our items! One o clock in the morning! This is one of the most ridiculous and stressful experiences I have dealt with. American not only has terrible customer service but not one of their employees was knowledgeable or accommodating to our situation. This was a nightmare and totally unacceptable! I would advise anyone to steer clear of flying American Airlines. Thank goodness for family that was able to meet me at the airport with new items to get home, otherwise I may have been stuck at the airport with my child all night! So extremely pathetic American Airlines."
1641," Poor customer service after delayed flights with American Airlines. Arrived at Columbia early to try and get another flight because I knew weather was bad today and it was going to be bad across the country. Even though the plane had 8+ seats on both legs to Cleveland I was refused standby and was not allowed to purchase a ticket. You lost an additional sale - someone needs some more training. So, as I guessed original flight from CAE is delayed. When the aircraft arrives, absolutely no hustle by anyone to get the plane boarded. I will give props to the pilot - was ready to push off immediately and made up some time in the air. Land in Washington and have to wait for the ground crew to move equipment out of the way. Really? How does this happen when we were due in 30 minutes ago? We have to wait for all luggage to be pulled and the wait for the bus driver to take us to the terminal. No attempts made to speed anything up. Finally make it to the terminal about 2 minutes late, and no effort is made to route another bus to the plane even though there were 15+ minutes until scheduled take off. I asked to check on other flights and he said he couldn't help me as he stares at his computer in front of him. I eventually make it onto another delayed flight after finding someone with some empathy. When you know all of you're flights are late, make an effort to care and try to be prepared and efficient. And it would be nice to hold flights for a few minutes when you know connecting flights are on the ground, but that's understandable not to hold them. 2 points for the pilot. Everyone else was a disappointment."
1642," They cancelled our flight from Michigan to Hawaii due to weather that hasn't even arrived. Now we have to wait 2 extra days, have lost 2 days of our vacation, where by the way we have to pay for the hotel that we won't even be at for 2 days. I'm extremely upset and have been sitting on hold for 53 min due to their rude phone agent! Also hidden fees, you will be paying for your seats after tickets are purchased if you want to sit next to your significant other, that was a fun extra $371 dollars, and still haven't paid for baggage! Thanks for absolutely nothing except for an unexpected extra $1,000 that we are paying for! This is not how to conduct a business!"
1643," Flew Nashville to Charlotte. Worst airline ever. Always delayed, guess what? One hour delay again and not surprised. Never on time. It’s getting ridiculous day after day. After redeeming my miles, I’ll switching to Delta. Don’t waste your money. I’ve tried Delta several times and was impressed every time. I strongly don’t recommend American Airlines."
1644," Our flight from Sarasota to our layover in DC (Reagan) was fine, and then our flight into Manchester was delayed countless times until it was finally canceled. A fantastic gate employee made it possible within minutes for us to get on a flight to Burlington, and managed to get our checked bag on it as well within a matter of minutes. Incredibly impressed with the effort of the American Airlines staff today, would recommend and absolutely fly again."
1645,  Wilmington to Charlotte. Worst traveling experience in my life. Rude customer service. I paid for a first class ticket and was treated like i didn't matter as a customer. On top of that they would not give me a hotel and now I'm sleeping on the floor in an airport. I would not recommend this airline to anyone.
1646," I arrived 4hrs early for my flight because I finished my work early. When I walked up to ask if there was any way for me to switch to a sooner flight I was instantly yelled at and told ""this is not your flight and you need to step away"". I waited and walked back up because the girl said ""there are two seats left and we boarded very fast"". I asked if there was any way to get on the flight. Instead of the girl politely saying I'm sorry we can not talk anymore, I received ""No you are way too late and its $75 anyway"". I would have been happy to pay the $75 if I could get on the earlier flight. This was so unprofessional and such bad customer service. I will not be flying American Airlines again. American fix your customer service. A manager was standing next to the girl at the counter and he said nothing. "
1647,  Boston to Los Angeles. Absolutely the worst airline. I purchased a ticket towards the front of the plan to be able to exit the plane quickly and have space for my carry on. I received news that my father was in the hospital so this was all done intentionally. For some reason I was placed in the last boarding group and with no surprise they ran out of room for carry on’s. I asked for some sort of help to grab my bag upon exit as other airlines do but they couldn’t even look me in the eye with a response. Only instruments and baby seats can they do that for. They were rude and lacked all empathy. If they would of set proper expectations that their planes cannot accommodate over half of their passengers carry on’s I would of purchased priority boarding or anything to avoid this. Their staff is rude with the worst attitudes. Avoid this airline at all cost.
1648,"  I'll keep this short and simple as to why I'm a ""one and done"" with American Airlines. Firstly, we sat in our plane on the runway way for 2 hours before taking off (being told mixed stories as to why we were delayed). We missed our connecting flight (and our upgraded seats we paid for and had to basically argue about upon arriving). When we finally got to our destination (3 hours late and missing our transportation we had paid for) our luggage was missing. The employees had zero empathy for us for our travel day from hell and handed us a form for our lost luggage (the form had a contact number which we couldn't get through to the following day after multiple attempts of calling). We were told to buy what we needed and we would be reimbursed (we had literally nothing until we got our luggage the following evening). A month after I began the reimbursement process I received a response from American Airlines stating that they don't reimburse for personal belongings due to lost luggage although it's clearly stated that they do on their website. Moral of the story when it comes to flying with American, don't do it."
1649," I would like to share the horrible experience that I had flying with American Airlines. I bought tickets from them to travel from Toronto to Houston and return. Toronto to Chicago to Houston (01/24/2018) Houston to Dallas to Toronto (01/29/18) The flight from Toronto to Houston was ok except for an hour delay. Everything turned into a nightmare when we were travelling back from Houston. Our flight from Houston was at 4:20PM (45 mins flight to Dallas) and our connecting flight from Dallas to Toronto was at 6:25PM (2hr 25 mins to Toronto). We got on the flight at 4:20 and we were stuck there for almost 1.5 hrs. According to the captain the air control did not give clearance and the plane had to refuel since it did not plan for the delay. After 1.5 hours they informed that we will not be able to catch our connecting flight from Dallas so it’s better to get off and re-book from Houston. We got off and asked to get our checked-in luggage. They said they cannot take that out and it will be going to Dallas. So we asked them what our options were since do not want to lose our luggage. During this time we got the notification that our flight was re-booked from Dallas at 7AM the next day (01/30/18), which meant we had to stay the night at Dallas. After discussing at the gate and with the flight crew they confirmed us that since we have a check-in baggage it will be better for us to go to Dallas and as it was an airline issue, accommodation will be provided for the night. We were convinced and agreed to get in the flight again and go for Dallas where we reached at 6:57PM (instead of 5:37PM) This is where everything started. After getting off the plane we went to talk to gate staff (as instructed) for our accommodation voucher and that is when they said ""Since it is not our fault, we will not be able to provide accommodation. In our system we see that it is coded for Tarmac delay due to clearance from Air Control which led to refueling"". We told them repeatedly that we were took off that plane and put back in and assured that there will be accommodation provided. We just had to talk to the gate. After that they said, ""Well sir, I do not see anything documented/coded in your account, therefore I cannot do anything. The best we can do is provide you hotels at distress rate"" The minimum amount of distress rate they offered was USD 65 without shuttle and if we wanted shuttle it would USD 75. Why would we pay anything? Was it our fault? We did not take their offer and the funny thing is the hotel we ended up staying “Days Inn hotel” was available on Booking.com for USD 65 with shuttle service. I do not know what kind of distress rate were they offering. You can find a copy of my hotel receipt below. We spent almost 2.5 hours travelling from Houston to Dallas and hearing them say that just made us frustrated and speechless. We were supposed to be at work the next day on 01/30/2018, so which meant 1 extra day leave from work."
1650," Four segments on American Airlines - all departures and arrival on time. Smooth flights, attentive flight attendants, clean aircraft, sufficient baggage stowage. Lunch on return was excellent with frequent servings of wine. Other snacks and complimentary non-alcoholic drinks served. Wi-fi was available but did not use. Boarding area had ample seating and the actual boarding was completed smoothly. The entire flying experience was stress-free - all very professional. While coming into land into La Guardia, was afforded a breathtaking view on a very clear wintry day of lower Manhattan with its skyscrapers and the waters around them. Will fly again with AA!"
1651,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Mexico City. Plane delayed and no food or compensation given other than apologies. First the plane had a mechanical issue that had to be fixed (good that it was) but approx 30 minutes delay. Second, the plane somehow was without a first officer or backup pilot. So we waited another 45 minutes while that person drove in from home. Third, long wait on tarmac to actually take off, I think they lost their slot in the queue as a result of the delays. No food on offer, ie included in the ticket. You could buy a box of processed meat and biscuits for $9. Great food service -  not. The staff themselves were trying. Wifi availability, you could buy it but the fine print said it would only work over USA, and this was a flight to Mexico, so no point there."
1652,"  I found an unbelievable low fare from NYC to Chicago for under $100 round trip and decided to take advantage of this deal. I was able to select available seats in advance at no extra charge. I didn’t expect much from this relatively short flight. The cabin was clean, and it looked full to me. It took on time, no delays on the return flight either. Each seat had IFE. Complimentary non alcoholic beverages were served and they had snacks for purchase but I don’t think anyone bothered to buy anything on board of this 2 hour flight. Overall I’m satisfied with the service."
1653,"  Los Angeles to Sydney. I really want to like and love AA! This was the return leg from LA booked on a Qantas code. Now originally I had been coming back on QF74 via SFO. However due to ATC issues in SFO three out of four flights leaving LAX were cancelled. Too their credit AA sorted the problem out and found a space on AA73 back to Sydney. That meant a bus ride back to T4 at LAX from one of the outlying terminals that AA uses. In addition a delay of 3 hours over the departure time of QF74. A separate review of the lounge at T4 but suffice to say I had a lot of time to kill. Books and phones help! Now the flight itself was on AA73 which is a B787 -9. Was keen to try this as it is the plane around which Qantas are building their future. Most if not all of my long haul is on the Airbus A380 with QF or EK. So the Boeing felt and was smaller.Ceilings were high and windows bit bigger but not as quiet as the Airbus. Being new everything had that new car feel to it! So the hard product is fine albeit I had better get used to it. It is the soft product where AA fails. On entering the craft the FA said: do I have to tell you where to go?  The food service was hurried and without any real warmth. I appreciate that FA's are working in cramped conditions and so will always ask an FA how his or her day is going and smile. US crews just seem not too care, its a job for them and they just do it on auto pilot. The famed US levels of service with a smile have long since gone. The seat, 24B was a nightmare. Exit row but so narrow and uncomfortable. The Boeing 787 is probably OK for flights up to 9/10 hours but beyond that I would not take it. The AA Flagship Lounge is superb and but besides that AA's soft product is just lacking."
1654,"  
Cancun to Omaha via Charlotte. My experience with American Airlines as a whole is abysmal, however, there was an instance that occurred last night that is ridiculous. My husband and I were flying from Cancun to Charlotte and then Omaha. Our flight to Charlotte landed about ten minutes late, we then had to go through immigration, customs, and security again and make it to our next flight that was in one hour. We got through everything as quickly as we could and then ran to the gate our flight was leaving out of and had missed it by 3 minutes. The workers at that gate directed us to a service desk to help with rerouting our flight. We explained the situation to the service desk and they put us on standby on a flight in the morning and reported that they could not confirm this flight for us because missing the flight was our fault. We asked for a hotel voucher for the night and this was refused for the same reason - that missing our flight was our fault. They refused to do anything else. The plane was late, we had to wait in three lines to get to a gate on the opposite end of the terminal, and these three lines took their sweet ass time. I'm not sure how blaming your customers gets you anywhere. Notorious for delayed flights and improper service."
1655," We flew with American Airlines a couple of years ago and it was just awful, my husband reassured me that things had got better and this time it would be okay - he was wrong and we will not fly with this airline again. We took four flights with them from Heathrow to Cancun via Miami and it was consistently bad. I hated that there was a surcharge for sitting together, something you expect when you are flying with a budget airline but not transatlantic flight. The food was dreadful, I am one of those rare people who quite like airplane food, but this was not good. “Chicken or pasta” was the mantra all the way down the aisle and when I asked for more information I just got chicken or pasta repeated. How about giving a full description over the tannoy and then no need to repeat it 300 times? I genuinely did not know what I was eating, it was unrecognisable. I left almost everything apart from the water. Finally the crew, really not nice people and only one flight attendant out of all we interacted with was pleasant. Their culture is one of (almost) intimidation, very unfriendly even for a Brit. I know they are probably tired but there was a real feeling that we were a nuisance and they don’t want to offer a service - not that we used the bell once during any of their flights. My husband went up to ask for another glass of wine and was told to ‘slow down’ - not something you expect. Really couldn’t wait to get off and will not return."
1656," Flew Chicago to Hartford. We were delayed for about an hour with very little communication with the front desk, this is my second flight in two weeks with American Airlines, they are notorious for delayed flights with little or no explanation why the flight is delayed or canceled. I don’t recommend this airline for anyone, I am a gold member and due to the area I have to travel they unfortunately the one who has the majority of flights! I truly wished I didn’t have to use them!"
1657," Flew Palm Beach to Baltimore via Charlotte. I will never fly American again. We checked two big bags in the terminal. We carried two very small kids suitcases to the gate, when I was informed that a “new product” American has no longer allows you to bring carry on bags that take overhead space. Sure enough, in my ticket to said “under seat bag only”. They then tried to charge me $50 per kids bag vs the $25 regular fee. I will never book a flight on your airline again. For $50 you just lost a customer for a lifetime. "
1658,"❎ Not Verified |  
Bradley to Raleigh Durham. The customer service I received to describe - terrible isn't a strong enough word! I had to check my bag and with no prior notification given. I was told they do not accept cash. So I had to purchase a card the would convert my cash to be applicable. The catch to it is they charge $5 just to purchase the card. The manager on duty at the time was of no help. For the information I had to physically call the customer service phone number while at airport. I do not believe I will do business with American Airlines. I am a frequent flyer and I've never been subject to these type of regulations. In the end I paid 30 for a checked bag that should have cost 25."
1659," I recently traveled from Stockholm to San Juan via London and Miami. The flight from London to Miami was delayed by 40 minutes, due to which American Airlines decided to bump me off from the connecting flight - as confirmed by the customer service. Despite the delay, I would have been able to make it to the flight well before it departed. People who arrived to the gate after me were allowed to board. Later, I was told by the customer service that I was bumped off to make sure that the plane would leave on time. This seems to be in conflict with what I experienced. Instead of sending me a message about me being bumped off the flight, American Airlines sent me emails about the flight being delayed. Had I been informed on time that I was not on the flight anymore, I could have gone to the re-booking counter right away. Now I ended up going to the gate and waiting there. I tried to ask the airline why they do not inform their customers about this kind of changes and if they believe it would be appropriate to do so, but received no answer at all. I ended up spending 24 hours in Miami on standby before getting on a flight to San Juan. I was constantly told by the airline staff at the airport that people would be let to board flights in the order they appear on the standby list. Yet, many people who were behind me on the list were allowed to board before me. I was in contact with the American Airlines customer service about the depressing experience with the airline. They struggled to give me a proper explanation on why I was bumped off the flight and the overall treatment I got at the airport. I exchanged three emails with the customer service but they failed to provide any coherent responses, which - I believe - is the least the airline could have done."
1660,"  Chicago to Oklahoma city. I’m really tired of airlines not taking responsibility for anything or taking care of their customers. I missed a flight by 5 minutes, because of my incoming flight from Europe was late due to security issues. And even though it was the last flight of the night they would not hold the plane, for 5 minutes, and they wouldn’t put me up in a hotel because it wasn’t their fault. Well it wasn’t my fault either. But I am the one who has to stay up all night in an airport. Lesson learned, from now on I’m only flying Southwest in the U.S. because they have consistently held planes when it was only a few minutes."
1661," I can see by the reviews here that American Airlines could not care less about bad reviews. I wouldn’t even give them one star if I had a choice. For an international flight, we purchased additional miles for $1300 so that we would have enough miles to fly “main cabin extra”. (This is an extra cost over regular coach because you get extra leg room and other benefits). Being claustrophobic, I needed the seats that we originally chose. AA changed the plane that they were going to fly to Australia (a 15.5 hour flight from LA) and took it upon themselves to move us to much worse seats in the regular coach section. My husband is a Platinum flier for life with 3 million miles flown on AA. After speaking to several supervisors at the platinum desk and writing to customer service, AA refused to do anything about it. At the very least, they should have refunded the $1300 that we had to pay to purchase extra miles in order to get the upgraded section! Shame on you American Airlines. It’s no wonder that you no longer carry an elite status in the airline industry if this is how you treat your customers who have been loyal to you for many years! Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines could teach you a thing or two about how to treat your customers right!"
1662,"  Miami to New York. This has been the worst experience ever, when it comes to boarding they should have an estimate on how many people have a carry on and there is no reason there is never space for everyone’s carry on. Also, the staff becomes rude when they start to tell you that you have to check in your bag, the problem I have with this is that they let certain people go and it becomes a personal judgement call rather than actually determining if someone has a larger carry on. Up entering I saw plenty of space still available even right above me there was a completely empty over bin. I try my best not to check in my bag because I always have to be out of the airport and I think they have just made it inconvenient for me to travel."
1663," Flew American Airlines from New York to Boston. This has been the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. I am from Australia and am a frequent flyer internationally and internally in AUS. First of all, we were informed we have one checked bag (that we would somehow have to fit under our seat)? Meaning if you had two bags the cost of adding another checked bag (my duffle bag) that should fit in overhead. You would pay $35 on top of what you had to pay for any checked in bags to begin with. Seems like anything they can do for extra money, has already been put in place with this airline. Uncomfortable seats, rude staff at security and a poorly organised airline. Me, along with the 5 other members I was travelling with will never fly with this airline again."
1664," Flew American Airlines from Baltimore to Albuquerque via Dallas Fort Worth. 2 flights, two broken planes. Had to spend a night in Baltimore because plane was leaking oil. Was given a food voucher of $24.00 for two of us. Now we were just were unloaded from plane to Albuquerque because what the pilot referred to as a “reacuring problem”."
1665,"  Washington to Boston. This has been the worst experience I have had with an airline. we were informed we have one checked bag (that we would somehow have to fit under our seat)? Meaning if you had two bags, the cost of adding another checked bag (my duffle bag) that should fit in overhead. you would pay $35 on top of what you had to pay for any checked in bags to begin with. Seems like anything they can do for extra money, has already been put in place with this airline. As we boarded the plane, it was a shock to notice an almost empty flight, meaning the extra we had to pay because we didn’t have the correct booking to access the overhead, was an excuse for us, as customers to pay more. Even though when I asked if the check in lady could help us out because we had just spent $200US on all our check in bags. There was clearly enough room for our carry on bags. But the customer service we received was not problem solving or useful to us. The flight had Uncomfortable seats, rude staff at security, overall it was a very poorly organised airline. Due to this, me, along with the 5 other members I was travelling with will never fly with this airline again."
1666,"  We had four itineraries on AA during our recent holiday to the US and Mexico with the final and worst being from Cancun to Miami. Some slight improvements since they ""lost"" our luggage years ago (and almost had to be sued for compensation) but still a 2 star airline. Boarding usually a shambles exacerbated by people flying with pets (dog fights at gates comical). Also people travelling with too much carry on causing huge delays. It isn't such an issue in other countries I'm not sure why such a problem with US airlines after having so many years to address the problem,. The real entertainment is usually the cabin crew, who I am sure are mostly nice people, it is just that their standard of training and presentation takes the joy out of the entire experience. Whilst all flights were pleasant enough, just walking onto a plane to see two poorly dressed flight attendants standing with their backs to you eating, instead of greeting customers is so bad it's hilarious. And it was the same for each of the seven legs we took over these three tickets. Apart from that the flights offered a variety of mediocre experiences from airplane condition to not being offered headphones in first class, but that didn't bother us as much as the dreadful presentation and complete lack of pride and professionalism. We only fly AA for the status credits to keep our Qantas Platinum (Oneworld Emerald), I hope that AA's recent image overhaul is still underway and better training standards on the horizon. Note - there isn't a Oneworld lounge at CUN and AA will not check your bags beyond USA, even though we were connecting to another Oneworld airline in biz class - Qatar (talk about chalk and cheese). This is appalling. We wasted 2hrs going through immigration to collect and re check our bags. What a waste of resources."
1667," American Airlines flights are popping up on search engines as cheaper flights, however their new policy makes you pay more once arriving to airport. Apparently as boarding group 9, you are no longer even allotted a once normal sized carry on bag. It must be checked and if you do self check in, and miss this, they will charge you 50$ at the gate to check a carry on bag. I fly once a month every month to and from San Francisco-Cleveland. I will no longer even consider any flight under American Airlines. Next thing the basic economy is going to start charging for is breathable air. The price gouging is absolutely ridiculous."
1668,"  Monroe to New York via Dallas / Atlanta. The most horrible and irresponsible airline, with unfriendly and rude staff. On top of my baggage is delayed, after one day it has been delivered at the airport, and thereafter no one knows where it is. It is transferred to some delivery company, and the company has no contact, and is waiting for driver to be assigned. No one has any clue, and the customer service representative only says one thing - Apologize - with no information. They are asking us to google and get information. Seriously cheap airlines, with zero responsibility.  Never witnessed such poor customer service and irresponsible airline behavior. Definitely the worst so far."
1669,"  Orlando to Manchester via Chicago. The flight to Orlando was fine. On the way back the flight was cancelled and rebooked three days later. We were told no compensation and not even a glass of water is possible as the flight cancellation is due to bad weather and an act of god. The longer flight from Chicago to Manchester had less space than the internal connecting flight from Orlando to Charlotte or Charlotte to Chicago. My son wears a splint and usually on Europe and domestic flights he is able to remove the splint and put it back on in his seat. But this flight from Chicago to Manchester was so cramped he was unable to do this. No hydration was offered, no space to stand up, and the vegetarian meals we ordered were not available. Absolutely awful treatment. I would not recommend flying with American unless there is no other choice. To top it all the plane was so old there was no inflight entertainment from Chicago to Manchester. Awful experience."
1670, Flew American Airlines from Houston to Barcelona via Miami. Disappointed in seat selection. A customer shouldn’t have to pay to pick an open seat. No options were available to choose from and my seat was randomly assigned. Flight attendants from other flights had better options than me. I will continue to try and avoid this airline.
1671,"  Miami to St Louis. I used to be a die hard fan of American Airlines until the last flight, they broke my laptop. Now they're refusing to take responsibility, for 3 months they are just buying time, telling me to wait for an email, and that only the bag department with no way of contacting them."
1672,"  Philadelphia to San Jose return via Charlotte on a mileage redemption. There were weather delays on both outbound and inbound dates, and AA made changes to my flights on both travel dates to ensure that I reached my destinations on time - outbound they put me on an earlier flight to CLT from PHL to ensure I made my connection in CLT to SJO, and on the return trip, completely re-routed me through MIA so I could arrive in PHL at almost the same time as my originally scheduled itinerary, all done with a smile and no additional charges. Need to give credit where credit is due - well done AA! That being said, the ex-US Airways A320s with absolutely no in-flight entertainment are really starting to grind my gears - they need to be put out of their misery. Flight crews on all segments were friendly and professional, but I did not appreciate having to pay for checked baggage and alcoholic drinks on international segments."
1673," I am writing this letter in utter disgust and frustration. I was travelling on A2657 from Orlando to Miami on 14/1/18 with what was to be a connecting flight to Antigua on A2405. Much to my surprise, we landed at MIA 5 minutes early, only to be held on the tarmac for an hour, all because there was an aircraft still at the gate, so much for being early. So AA had a plane for an hour, on the tarmac just waiting with passengers who had connecting flights. To make matters worst being the concerned passenger I asked the head flight attendant a question, to which she had the audacity to rudely state that I should have flew in the night before. The nerve of her. After finally being able to deplane & having to scramble to G21, much to my demise the flight had already closed off, and instead of aiding assistance to an already frustrated me, the female agent rudely said we are not getting on. Seems like some of these females employed by AA need training. The male agent made it his priority to calm an already angered me. Good Job to him. He advised me that the airline would accept fault. You would think that my anger would have ended there. After being told that I would be placed in a hotel at the expense of the airline, I was given a $12 food voucher. Really American. I had to pay an additional $15 for proper food. Another Issue was the shuttle that was to take me to the hotel had me waiting 2 hours, by this time I had given up. Fast forward to Monday 15th shall we, I got to the airport thinking it would be a better day but no, here I was thinking that my first class seat 4C would still be available so I could at least have one thing to smile about. I was told that I would be occupying 12A. I am awaiting a reward for that First class ticket that I purchased. 
"
1674, I am a FF with American Airlines and have been satisfied with the overall performance of the airline during this time of inclement weather. We arrived in CLT on the evening of Jan 7th and found our flight to PHL was delayed. The delay became longer as the planes for the 20.00 and 22.15 from CLT to PHL were both delayed or grounded elsewhere. This was an issue for all flights with some customers being delayed more than two flights. AA solved the problem by using a larger plane that held the passengers from both flights to PHL. We arrived later than we wanted but our bags arrived with us. AA did a god job in tough conditions.
1675, Flew American Airlines from Charlotte to Los Angeles. We have sat at the departing gate for over an hour without any explanation. The captain just announced by first saying we must not have heard his last announcement (which he didn’t make). He said the “paperwork is almost done”. The flight attendant told me there was a maintenance issue. Why would the captain not have made an announcement earlier and then just sat hr paperwork was now ready? That is poor leadership and customer service.
1676,"  Miami to Tampa. My husband and I were extremely disappointed flying on American Airlines with two small children. We had a stroller, a few carry on hand bags, a seat for my toddler for the plane, and two kids that were asleep and during the four trips (we all had four round trip connecting flights from Tampa to Dominican Republic),we were the last to get on and the last to get off. It was by far the most stressful plane ride for us because we had to carry both kids, all the bags, the install the chair into the seat with everyone on the flight looking at us. There were several flight attendants looking at us with faces that screamed, hurry up and get to your seats because we have to fly. In fact, one flight attendant was more focused on gathering her suitcases to get off the plane then: “hey, let me help you guys?!” From this experience if you’re not going to board parents with small children first or help them get settled and off the plane safely, then I’m never going to fly with my family on this plane because it wasn’t kid-friendly. I honestly felt like I was inconveniencing everyone - never again!"
1677,"  I had an international flight scheduled from Auckland to Los Angeles on American. As we approached our gate we were informed our flight was cancelled because the crew was sick. We were then made to stand in lines for 4 hours to get our luggage back from off the plane. We were sent away from the airport to a hotel, still with no information on a rescheduled flight. We were then contacted for the next two days with constantly changing information about our rebooking. American Airlines also miscommunicated to the hotel the value of our food vouchers; we were told a particular value in the airport, and the hotel was only told half the amount. two days after our scheduled departure, we were rebooked, loaded back in a bus to the airport, and upon parking and unloading, informed that our flight had been cancelled again; we were sent back to the hotel. Finally, three days later we were put into a flight with a different airline and were able to get back to the US. I missed two days of work and had to buy a completely new ticket for a connecting flight in the US because of the delay, and they offered a measly voucher worth less than half the cost of the original flight. I wrote a complaint email, detailed with pictures and information, and American Airlines headquarters refused to budge. I'm extremely displeased. I also flew American Airlines in September and my plane had to make an emergency landing due to engine failure. We had to pack into a van and be driven the remaining 2-3 hours to our destination, and they offer of compensation was subpar, to say the least. Don't fly American. Fly a reliable airline."
1678," Flew American Airlines from Reno to Dallas Fort Worth. Horrible, inconsiderate experience. First flight of the day and they had us wait 39 mins to de-ice plane which made us late to our connection. 16 of us ran and got to the gate only for them to close and lock the door and deny us on. Sold all of our seats to standby passengers. Travel often and my first disgusted review."
1679," Customer service is terrible! No one is accommodating. I was booked to go from Baltimore to Philadelphia then Philadelphia to Charlotte then Charlotte to Ft Walton Beach at Gate C2 at BWI. Literally across from me at C3 was a flight to Charlotte leaving slightly before me. I arrived and had plenty of time to possibly fly standby but was told I could not. 1 rep on the phone said I had to have a “same route change” despite the fact it was literally going to my one hub destination-Charlotte and there was a winter travel advisory for yesterday in Philadelphia. The personnel at gate told me I couldn’t because I would have had to change it downstairs. I’m getting mixed messages. AA could have had an extra seat in Philadelphia if it needed it, especially with the travel advisory yesterday I can imagine there were a lot of delays and cancellations. I asked where the change of ticket policy was easily accessible to he customer and was told “you have to search for it in the search box”. It’s not clearly expressed when you buy your ticket. This is my first and last time flying American Airlines. I would rather pay more for a ticket than deal with their poor routes and terrible service."
1680, Charlotte to Birmingham. The absolute worst flight experience I've encountered. There were numerous delays in flight times and currently one gate change at this time but that's subject to change. My plans with family are no more and have missed a family event very important to me thanks to American Airlines.
1681," Flew San Diego to New York JFK. I will never fly with AA again! I flew American Airlines twice in the last two years. My checked in bags were lost both times. I made international calls and was told by American Airlines that they could not locate my bags, they did not offer any other assistance as well, which was the most frustrating part as a passenger. AA has been reckless and irresponsible. "
1682,"  Domestic flight from Phoenix to Miami. Check-in a bit chaotic and don't think the machine took our payment for hold luggage, but produced the luggage labels. PHX a murky airport. Boarding efficient for a full flight and we left on time. Seats as you expect on a A320 - comfortable and good leg room for a 3 hour flight. FAs friendly and served what they had with a smile which is nice. We purchased some drinks and enjoyed the flight. To be fair, good value for money, efficient (second time I've used that word) and on time. We and our luggage well taken care of - what more do you want?"
1683," Flew from Seattle to Boston via Philadelphia. Navigating American’s area in Seattle was easy enough. We checked in at the self-serve kiosks. Boarded on time and got into the air in good time. The first leg was aboard their newly-configured Airbus A321. I was in seat 26F. The seat was pretty old on the 5-hour flight. Width felt very tight, and the legroom was made difficult by a low-hanging seat and my underseat storage occupied. Also, the streaming IFE did not work for the entire flight. Things quickly got very boring. Cabin service was on par, however the flight attendants did seem very unenthusiastic. Connection in Philadelphia was pretty simple, however we had a long walk between gates that would have been difficult with a short connection time. The flying time up to Boston was very quick. I was occupying seat 20F on the Airbus A320, and it was significantly more comfortable. The seat width was the same, but I was able to get my bag further under the seat, which allowed for greater legroom. Cabin service was better on this leg, however it was a short flight. IFE streaming was again not working properly, but it was a short hop so I didn’t mind. Overall, my experience on American got me back across the country, but the “cattle class” narrative certainly being applied. Thankfully, it wasn’t too expensive, but I expected a little more from a legacy carrier. Every LCC experience I’ve had recently has been better. But it’ll definitely get you where you need to go."
1684," I’ve never wrote an review for anything in my life. But from my last experience from American Airlines, I made it my obligation to review this poor flight. I had a flight from Norfolk to San Diego via Dallas. I arrive at my flight on time just for them to delay my flight for an hour. Finally take off and when I arrive at Dallas my flight was just now taking off. I was extremely annoyed. Had to wait in a line for up to an hour and a half since there was an absurd amount of people that missed their flight as well. Was told that my next guaranteed flight will be that next following day, but I have the option to wait for the last available flights of that night, I will just be on stand by. Waited for 3 long hours to see if me and my girlfriend can squeeze in but we got denied. I was told I was number 14 on the list but another administrator told me I was number 12 on the stand by list. Very unorganized. The only positive thing that came from this was that they gave us an hotel voucher for the night. However, I was told that my bags had already took off without me and I will have to go get them at the baggage claim when I arrive at SD. Not only that, but when I was in a line for my hotel voucher, you can even hear the customer assistance saying “I’m leaving in 2 minutes, Im going home.” Mind you there are groups of people waiting to find a place to stay that have been traveling all day long. What type of service is that? Glad to know that American Airlines care about their passengers. That next following morning I wait by the gate to board my flight that was around 06:20. Came to find out that they switched the flight to another gate number when I went to the help desk to see if I was at the right location. Thank god I asked or I would of missed out on another flight. Nobody even notified us that the gate number even had changed. What type of service is that? I will never in my life fly this company again. The apocalypse can occur and they can have the last flight to safety and I still wouldn’t take it. This company doesn’t care about anything but their wallets."
1685," American Airlines is bar none the worst airline to fly. My wife and I were flying from Nashville to Newport News. We had a layover in Charlotte. The flight was delayed on the track so we made it to Charlotte and ran to the next gate, they were still boarding with over a third still in line. When we got to the ticket counter the (rude) woman told us they had given our seats away. My 5 month pregnant wife and I sprinted to make this flight so we could make it to our party in time. This woman could not have cared less. They gave our seats away and we were there. The customer service rep informed us that a refund would not be given because they put us on a different flight. That is completely besides the point and with any honor American would have done the right thing and given us a refund since they were the sole reason we missed our party. They were the rudest people to deal with and I will never deal with them again. There is no doubt that the rating they have is well deserved as being lowly incompetent people. Fly Delta/Southwest/whatever else you can but stay away from American. "
1686, The flight from New York to Charlotte was delayed more than 2 and a half hours. I also had my pet with me. Due to the flight being delayed so much I missed my connecting flights. Then I talked to the lady of American Airlines who was extremely rude and gave me the next flight at 7.25 pm which is ridiculous. I was supposed to be at my final destination which was Peoria (PIA Airport) at 12.00 pm but I sat at Charlotte airport for around 10 hours with a pet. This was a very ridiculous service. I'm very unsatisfied with their poor service.
1687,"  Glasgow to Providenciales via Miami. The worst Airline we have ever flown. Completely ruined a £19,000 holiday. American Airlines lost our luggage containing baby milk. Long story short baby became ill from having to use different milk. We had to leave Turks and Caicos after 4 days losing 6 days at £1,100 a night. Contacted a woman on American Airlines who changed our flights to go home via New York so the baby could get better and we arrived at Providenciales to find that our flights had been changed to economy from business class and also that we would have to pay baggage fees. Now in New York trying to get home and we are being charged again for flight to Glasgow! I am utterly disgusted with this airline.  Avoid this airline at all costs."
1688," 
Mexico City to Miami return. AA1031 and AA2416. Both flights on 319, although going out was a better seat (row 12 both ways), return had no legroom whatsoever. To the flights, not charged for bags which was good, no beverage service apart from soft drinks and coffee/tea. Flight was early into Miami but waited 45 mins to get to gate, probably not Americans fault. So late. Return on time but seat room bad, I measured 27 inches, almost impossible for a 6 foot person to sit. Broken bag on return, sorting out now."
1689,"Flew American Airlines from St Louis to Chicago. Aside from a rather temperamental APU the flight was wonderful. The seats were perfectly adequate for this short journey. The cabin staff were friendly and responsive to passenger needs and requirements. Drinks were served shortly after takeoff along with snacks, nothing else could be expected for a flight of one hour. Wi-Fi was available but I didn't use it."
1690," Santo Domingo to New York. January 1st, 2018. We’ve been stuck at the airport in Santo Domingo since 1:30 only to find out our flight is pushed to 10 am next day. American Airline knew way before 1:30pm that they did not have enough crew to fly but didn’t bother telling customers until 7pm. They knew that crew that was flying in will not fly back because they had to take mandatory break. Do they have any regard for their customers?‬ Nothing stopping them from charging $1,200 for economy tickets and $25 for the first checked bag on a top of that. But they feel that it's perfectly fine not to inform their passengers about the flight that won't be flying any time soon. Were they too afraid to lose some money from that ridiculas fare? This is a complete ignorance or incompetence. The way they put it ""a mistake the company made"". A mistake they said they’ve fixed already. There was a news article by major news outlet 2-3 weeks ago that American Airline granted too much PTO time to their pilots and crews for the holiday season and major service outages are expected. AA responded that issue is resolved and no delays or cancellations are expected. I guess it was just a PR spin."
1691," Cleveland to Punta Cana via Charlotte. We travelled as a family of 8 for Christmas to Punta Cana. Thanks to AA we missed a whole day in Punta Cana because we missed our flight to Charlotte. We missed the flight because we were waiting for staff to bring a wheelchair for my grandmother who cannot walk through an airport. When we got to the gate, staff said the plane was gone and we were 2 min late. Staff even acknowledged that the time stamp on our luggage was an hour before boarding time. We waited an hour for a wheelchair. We told them we could push the chair but they did not allow it. There was only one lady working the wheelchair area. Of course it being the holidays they could not get us to our destination that day. We flew to Charlotte that day but had to stay the night. They gave us 1 room for my grandmother since she needed the wheelchair, but we had to pay for additional rooms. I guess AA thought we could have left an old lady and got on a flight without her. We are a family! We come together and leave together! The luggage was a whole other situation. We had the AA agent check all of our luggage tickets. She ensured us that once we missed the flight our luggage did not go either. Well, my luggage was in Punta Cana without me. Once we made it to Punta Cana only 1 family member's luggage came on the belt! Total disaster and staff had no idea where it was. Everyone elses luggage eventually came and all was good. I am very disappointed in AA, we even tried to get refunds and just cancel the trip. They would not give refunds because they said it was our fault that we missed the original flight. We had travel insurance. This is the short version of what happened. The misinformation from AA agents in Cleveland, Charlotte, and Punta Cana is another story. Never again. Oh no wifi on the plane, but the flight attendants were nice. On the way home, I did have to listen to the flight attendants entire personal conversations because I was sitting in the very last row. That was annoying because I wanted to sleep."
1692," Flew American Airlines from Los Angeles to Amsterdam via Philadelphia. Staff at the airport were really friendly and helpful but as soon we got on the first flight the staff were rude. We could here them swearing and shouting to each other at the back of the plane. We had a long flight (6hrs) to Philadelphia and were only offered one drink and a cookie because no one had checked the catering before take off so there was no food on board. There was also no entertainment on board. Before taking our second flight we asked and checked if there was entertainment so we could prepare ourselves and buy magazine/books etc. The lady told us that each seat had a tablet style screen. When got on board there were only small central screens in the aisles and the headphone jacks gave so much feedback it was unbearable to listen to. We unfortunately had bad snow and wind, combined with a technical fault we were delayed by 3 hours. Communication was terrible during this time and during bad turbulence."
1693," Absolutely terrible. The airline chose to cancel my flight so they could reroute numerous people and squeeze in their 18 stand by passengers. By doing this they missed my connection flight (even with a 3 hr layover). Upon arrival they scheduled me for a 6pm flight. At 5.45 American Airlines over-rode the airports authority and cancelled our flight, because they wanted more passengers from yet another rerouted plane catching my connection, except after making us wait an extra hour for them to make yet more money, the impending airport had a slight emergency. Had American thought of their passenger who booked months in advance, instead of stand-bys I would have made my trip in the scheduled 4hrs, instead of 18. They refused to re-fund any money. They are a monstrosity of an airline. Every other company made their flights to the same airports on schedule without delay. They claimed inflight wifi, none. It connected but didn't work. They are utterly useless."
1694,  New Orleans to Philadelphia. I fly American Airlines as much as possible due to convenience. I recently purchased a ticket the night before for $500 and the next day the ticket was $57. This was a family emergency but they refused to refund or help with this ridiculous cost. It suppose to be $200 to change your flight. Not sticking to their own policy apparently.  I'll be avoiding them at all costs moving forward.
1695," I bought my daughter and grandson a ticket to come and see me in Chattanooga. Their flight back (today) was supposed to leave at 5.45pm, it's 7.15pm right now and they are still sitting on the plane because it won't start! She has a 5 month old with her, and no information is being given to the passengers. I've flown this airline myself in December. I can honestly say that I would never book with American Airlines again. I will start flying with Delta again. They are telling my daughter that she probably has to rebook her connecting flight, this airline continues to disappoint."
1696,"  Buffalo to Jacksonville via Charlotte. An hour of gate delays after boarding made for a very tight connecting flight with no assistance, which isn't required but would be appreciated. The real gripe is the ticket takers were notified that carry on space was reached and despite major concerns that $75,000 worth of camera equipment was not something to risk lightly. I was given no choice in the matter - and getting on the flight to find five bins and room for a dozen bags remained. Flight attendants claimed it was too late to get a bag seven feet from where we were standing because it was across the threshold. This a broken process handled by bitter agents."
1697,"❎ Not Verified |  My husband and I came from Detroit airport and we spent almost 10 days in New York. We didn't have any problems coming to New York but today we arrived at La Guardia airport very early and we went to the main line to try to get an early flight back home. The woman was extremely rude. My husband asked for an early flight and she pretended not to hear him and started doing our check-in for the regular flight. He asked her again if she was doing a check-in for the earliest flight and she answered him rudely with a ironic smile saying that we had to pay more for that flight. Even before she told us the price for the flight change, she finished checking us in when, my husband asked her how much was the fare if we wanted to get the earlier flight and again she gave us the ironic face telling us the price while handing us the tickets. I believe that every person that works a job when they need to be in contact with others, they must learn how to be polite and be respectful to whoever they are dealing with."
1698," Detroit to Miami. Terrible, terrible experience. The airline was delayed for 3 hours which would have been okay, if it wasn't for the rest of the ride. Some of the inflight entertainment monitors were broken, mine included. No wifi was available at all. It was easily 100 degrees with the air conditioning. The descent gave me airsickness for the first time in my life and it was the worst landing I've felt yet. Then we waited 20 minutes sweltering, waiting to taxi to the gate. Finally I emerge and our bags are not there because of the ""volume of luggage"" on the flight. So we have to wait. The service was polite but the whole staff clearly didn't care about the passengers experience, opinion, nor did they give us anything to compensate for the misery. Don't fly American, I never will again"
1699,  San Antonio to Dallas. I was charged a seat change fee of 30.50 when there was nothing saying that there would be an upcharge. I called to see how to fix this and the lady was very rude. She put me on hold for at least 2 minutes after getting frustrated with me because she didn't understand how to spell my name. Overall I'm extremely disappointed in the whole trip and experience.
1700,"  New York to El Paso via Dallas Ft Worth. Canceled and delayed, not because of weather, because throughout a 2 day process they were not able to coordinate a pilot and crew together at the same time even though they sold us tickets to an on-time flight. This company should be ashamed of his negligence to their ability to function as a serious business."
1701,"  Dallas Ft Worth to San Jose. Our flight was delayed a minimum of three hours not due to weather, but to the lack of the number of flight attendants. Unfortunate that the top can only fill two for flight attendants whenever within the first two hours after the flight was originally scheduled. After three hours, only three of the four attendants were present."
1702," My first flight was delayed due to weather. Understandably, it's winter. I expressed my concern that because of the one hour delay I would not be able to make my connection flight and immediately sought out an attendant. The attendant understood, and reserved a backup flight in case the our original second flight took off before we landed. Once we landed we discovered that before we even were taxied to the gate our backup was cancelled and our connecting flight was in the air. On a call to customer relations they couldn't do anything for us until tomorrow. Leaving us in Dallas. We talked back and forth until they said they could set us up on a backup flight to a town 70 miles away from our ending destination. Who knows how this will end up. I've always flown Delta and have never had a problem. Will never use American Airlines again."
1703,"  Dallas to New York via Chicago and the flight was horrible. DFW-ORD was amazing but as soon as we landed, we were told of a delay because our gate was occupied and I only had a 45 mins layover. We rushed to our gate and thankfully they had delayed it. We finally boarded after a 2 hour delay and as soon as we sat down, the captain said that there was a hydraulic fluid leak and we had to deplane and board another aircraft. When we landed in NY we waited for an hour for bags and then we find out that the bags were at the wrong Carousel. We were traveling on Christmas Eve and our flight was supposed to arrive at 10:30pm but we reached at 1:00am Christmas Day. This was the Nightmare before Christmas!"
1704,  Tampa to Springfield via Dallas. Terrible airline. I left Springfield on 12/30 and arrived at airport at 2.10 pm for my 3.20 pm flight to Dallas connecting to a flight to Tampa. Plane delayed 3 hours and 15 minutes in Springfield. Finally a rescue plane came from Chicago and flew us to Dallas. I missed my connecting flight and there were no flights until 12/31. No agent to assist with meals or accommodations at Dallas. I was confirmed on 7.15 am flight which was cancelled. Now waiting to see if the 9am flight will actually leave. Once AA sent me a confirmation for the next morning flight I attempted to book a seat and was charged $40.66 for a total of 7 attempts. Got an exit row seat for $48 and change. Had already upgraded on my missed flight on 12/30. Spent the night at hotel and paid my own meals. I will hope to never travel on American again and I definitely don’t recommend this airline. I called customer service and they would not help with accommodations they offered a travel co for a discount. Lousy service.
1705,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Miami in January 2017. Staffed premium counter in DFW for check-in was fast and friendly. Priority for TSA was issued, but TSA chose to close down the priority line, so back to the general line. However, the wait was not too bad. Used AAdmirals Club lounge which was a modern and comfortable facility with a nice apron view. Received a voucher for one free ""premium drink"". Food choices were rather poor (soup, cookies, vegetables and dips and cheese cubes) and all drinks were served at the manned bar, (tips expected) except tap water, coffee and tea. Most alcoholic drinks are charged at steep airport prices.  On board, pre-flight drinks were offered. Seats were very good (the same or very similar to CX) in an herringbone 1-2-1 configuration. IFE was AVOD and screen size and quality very good. Content was large and varied. Headphones were provided. WIFI was available, but too slow to be useful. A chicken couscous salad (or cheese ravioli) was served for dinner, which was very bland and bordering tasteless. Service by cabin crew was good and attentive. Overall, in my opinion AA delivers a much better experience than UA or DL. However, inflight catering is the weak point. Flight was on time. Overall again a pleasant experience for a U.S. domestic flight.."
1706,"  January 2017, Las Vegas to Corpus Christi via Dallas Ft Worth, to Dallas in economy (main cabin extra) on A321 and from Dallas in first (upgrade) on an MD80. Used check in kiosk in LAS; everything is self-service, except weighing the luggage. No lines and fast. In difference to my previous flight with UA a manned premium check in counter was offered as well. TSA in LAS relaxed and fast with basically no lines. LAS seems to be a well run and modern airport. Boarding as indicated and efficient. First segment to DFW was on a modern A321 with back seat screens and headphones for sale (5 USD). As usual for domestic flights in the U.S. drink service only, and some basic food choices plus alcoholic drinks for sale (overpriced and no cash accepted, so irrelevant). Flight packed, seats comfortable for Y and leg room good for Y due to main cabin extra. FA’s were professional, but nothing more. Departure almost on time and early arrival into DFW. All good for a domestic flight; a decent experience. DFW is an efficient airport to transit through and I incurred no problems. DFW-CRP on an old MD80; probably the very last time on this type of plane, as there are not many more in service. Kind of a nostalgic experience, as the DC9 was the first plane i was on as a child. Thanks to an upgrade in F a comfortable flight; old style recliner seats, which I find more comfortable than the newer models. The purser on this flight was exceptionally friendly, attentive and chatty. Drink service only, which is ok for a late evening one hour flight. This flight showed that AA can be a good experience, especially if you get one of the original AA crews. Luggage took longer than expected and my priority luggage came out almost last. So much better than my flight with UA."
1707,  Montreal to Miami. First of all they charge to check in your luggage and whats even more ridiculous is that they charge extra if your suitcase is over 50 pounds. I paid to check in my suitcase who cares about  weight.  Once I got to my gate they said the overhead was full so I had to check in my carry on. I wasn't too happy. They promised me the overhead was full and there was no way around it. I finally caved and complained so they didn't charge me. So I basically would have paid to check in my first suitcase for nothing. When I got in the airplane at my seat I noticed they completely lied to me and the overheads were practically empty. The seats have cheap covers on them I'm not impressed!!
1708," I flew from Washington to Phoenix via Dallas in first class just after Christmas. After reading some of these reviews I was not expecting much, but I thought everything was fine. Even though the MD-80 is an older aircraft, the seats were still comfortable. The flight left on time and the flight attendants were very nice. They allow you to pre-order your meal online with at least 24 hours advance notice. I ordered the lasagna, which came with a salad and warm rolls from a breadbasket. Warm cookies were served afterwards. Then on the Dallas to Phoenix flight we were given a snack; I chose the hummus with crackers. Again, the flight attendants were very nice. Perhaps others have had other experiences, but I honestly can't fault them for anything and I would fly them again on first class."
1709,"  Detroit to Nashville via Philadelphia. This is the second time in one week that I have had an issue with this airline. Not only do they think it’s ok for a plane to arrive later than scheduled when it says “on time”, they don’t care that they are ruining people’s schedules. I asked for at least a courtesy voucher and they said no, because they don’t feel it’s their fault. Well if you sit on an American Airlines plane for over an hour and you are in your destination City, whose fault is it? These flights costs to much for inconsistencies. The attitudes of the gate attendants are rude and they think they could speak to you any kind of way. This airline needs better manners, better schedules, better prices, and no more inconsistencies."
1710,"  Los Angeles to Philadelphia. For over $500 roundtrip, you'd think you'd have in-flight entertainment, or a charging station, or the option to buy a meal, or the ability to cross your legs without banging the seat in front of you - but, no. None of the above was part of this horrendously uncomfortable experience. I'm finished with American. Sadly, I have to return on an American flight, but never again will I purchase tickets from this airline. I wonder if the CEO would enjoy the experience I just had of flying on an ancient, pre-modern era plane with no food (except disgusting snacks), no entertainment, no ability to charge a device so you can have enjoy own entertainment, and no leg-room."
1711,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Abilene. American Airlines out of Abilene is inefficient, and annoying! The delays from Abilene to DFW  are frequent. Often I miss connecting flights because of these delays. The latest connector flight I missed was to go home for Christmas. Driving is a great and at times better option."
1712,"  Los Angeles to Dallas Ft Worth. I paid for First Class and was treated worse than coach by the flight attendant. I initially asked for a cocktail and was told that I had to wait until she began serving drinks. No problem. When she finally did come to my seat she took my order very begrudgingly making faces as if she really want to starve me. After which, she served meals. I’m pescatarian, so I couldn’t eat any of the selections. I solicited her attention and asked if there were any Vegan meals, to which she angrily responded “NO”. On our descent, I really had to use the bathroom. She loudly stated that I needed to be seated because we were landing so I complied and returned to my seat. I calmly waited until the plane had taxied and the seatbelt light went off. The attendant rushed forward and said I had to sit down as I was closing the bathroom door. She continued to yell outside of the toilet. I don’t feel that American Airlines should continue to employ  employees who have their own agendas."
1713," The airplane on this route for a 9 hours flight lacked personal inflight entertainment and only had “shared” TV. It also lacked USB ports for charging phones. Only a few seats had chargers but they required an AC adptor like the ones that are inserted in a car cigarette lighter. The airline advertised free WiFi with online entertainment available on personal phones, but it didn’t work. The inability to charge phones would have also diminished its value regardless. The rows of seats were not evenly spaced. Ours was particularly narrow making it difficult to even place or remove the carry on luggage under the seat. It was a very boring, uncomfortable flight. I usually don’t fly this Airline due to its poor reputation. I purchased the ticket with British Airways not realizing the flight was operated by American Airlines. I had also requested a special meal which wasn’t honored. I was hoping they would prove my perception of them wrong, but they did not. On a positive note, the on board personnel was pleasant and helpful."
1714, Jacksonville to Charlotte. Poor service both ways. Why use mobile ticket when one has to go back to counter after waiting cause there is issue with ticket? What is the purpose of pre check if line not open? Flight attendants subpar. Multiple flight delays on way to this destination with aa personnel ever changing excuses. Uninformed reps in airport telling clients the can stay in airport then being run off by security telling us we have to leave terminal. Supposed to be best airline of 2017 but definitely not. Worst than Spirit and United combined.
1715,"  Indianapolis to Phoenix. Service was fine, the pilot made the softest landing in all my years of flying. The trip to the gate, even though direct, was easy. I was expecting this horrible experience, like I get with United, but it wasn't. It was a normal typical flight. For me that's all I can ask for. There was a delay but they are working all days of the year to get me where I want to go. So this was awesome, thank you for getting me here safely, I look forward to my trip back."
1716,"  I booked a flight from Houston to Toronto with a layover in Chicago. My flight from Chicago to Toronto was supposed to leave at 3 p.m. We were supposed to start boarding at 2:30 p.m. My flight into Chicago landed at 2:10 p.m. after which I ran to get to my gate. I arrived there at 2:25 p.m. and waited for them to start boarding. At around 2:35 p.m. the agent at the counter said that they were waiting on a crew member to start boarding, that she was flying in to gate L10, and would come right over (we were at gate L8). After about 10-15 minutes we got another update that the crew member had landed and was on her way over. At around 3:10 p.m. we started boarding and was on the plane waiting to leave by 3:30 p.m. The pilot announced that there would be a bit of delay because there was a plane in front of us. So we waited. After about 20 minutes, he announced that the storm that they were trying to avoid had hit Toronto so we couldn't leave. We were going to turn back and deplane, that the delay would be about 4 hours. Then when we deplaned, they cancelled the flight. I called the rebooking number to book another flight and they put me on the 11:52 a.m. flight the next morning. Tried to get a hotel voucher and the agent says to me that in the system, the reason for the booking was as a result of weather, so no vouchers were being offered. I countered that had we not waited on that crew member and left at 3 p.m. as originally scheduled, we would've missed the storm. He said that in the system it says weather and there's nothing he could do."
1717," Chicago to Newark. Status quo ""I don't care"" mentality. Nothing new for an US based airline. 10 minutes before boarding people started asking why no one was manning the gate. We finally flagged down an airport rep who went into the computer to tell us the gate changed to the other side of the terminal. Upon checking for boarding, they asked me to check the size of my carry on. It fit, but touched the bar (make no mistake, it fit without pushing). The gate rep told me my bag had to fit without hitting the bar. When, I told him I could remove items to fit in my empty backpack (I'd rather have a light backpack) he slapped a tag and told me I was disrupting boarding (I was on the side of the line and not disrupting the boarding process). Without giving me a chance to unload my carryon a second gate rep came, forcefully took the bag from me and told me, ""you should have listened to the announcement, oh well"". I had just rushed from the other side of the terminal because they forgot to tell people they moved the gate. I dont know why I'm so disappointed in this ""im a flight rep, I make the rules"" mentality from a US based airline. But I am."
1718,"  Chicago to Manchester, UK. So disappointed with the customer service from American. Mechanical issues delayed our flight 15 hours overnight, before they just cancelled the flight without notifying us when we would be rebooked. Due to these mechanical issues and the minimal communication, we are spending Christmas Eve and Christmas stranded at the airport. It's a real shame since we can't get more vacation time from work and haven't been to see family in over a year! Can't trust American to get us there anymore."
1719,"  Sacramento to Phoenix. Awful service in general; if what you are looking for is to have a bad time, wasting more than 8 hours in a max 3 hours flight, being stressed and not enjoying the holidays because of the incompetence of the airline personnel in core tasks such as showing up on time and sending your luggage to the correct address, this company is the way to go. You would think of this as a bad coincidence, but when they did the same thing to almost every single customer in the flight, you realize that the company should not be operating in such conditions because they are not following their part of the service. Unless you want to have a reference point of what the worst service possible can be, don't even bother in checking the cost of a flight with this company."
1720," Treated my family to a First Class flight to visit family in Texas. Flying American from Islip to Dallas Fort Worth via Philadelphia. First leg fine (Islip to Philadelphia), except for a really snarly, older flight attendant that acted like we were all cutting into her 'me' time. Just informed by the ticket agents at Philly that our 8:25 pm flight is delayed until 12:25 pm because they gave our crew to another delayed flight. Chaos ensued. Who wants to be in an airport all night? Well apparently the ticket agents missed the kindergarten a.m. vs. p.m. lesson. Still stuck here for another three hours and now my family has to pick us up at 4 am. People complaining, but ticket agents just giving everyone the 'who gives a damn' look. Do yourself a big favor and pass up this airline and its unhappy crew and staff!"
1721,  Dallas Ft Worth to Denver. American Airlines overbooked our flight to Denver and said there was only three spots left. We waited 2 hours after that for them to book us another flight and on top of that the lady said I don’t get a hotel voucher or a taxi voucher. She finally gave me a hotel voucher which was 14 miles away from the airport so I had to pay $45 taxi ride to a sketchy hotel. I will never fly American Airlines again. The worst customer service I have ever encountered. I paid for a very expensive flight and hotel in Denver and didn’t get to stay in it. 
1722,"  Los Angeles to Philadelphia. I never got on the plane. I got my luggage on the plane. Security made me go back and get paper ticket. Security short cutted me to get me to gate on time. They delayed the flight. I went to desk and tried to talk to employee she told to go sit down.  Then she says there Overbooked and every one left had to catch next flight. I went to desk and I was promised i would be on next plane 6 hours later. And left in airport at 1am with no access to food or drinks to sleep on floor under my coat. 6am comes around. And nothing, overbooked again. Told to sit 15 hours for a chance of getting on plane. I asked them to book me with another airline that had seats available and left in an hour. They said they wouldn’t do it. I asked for a refund. They said no. Now they offer 25$ refund on 700 something tickets. Do not use this airline they will rip you off with no remorse. "
1723," I flew from Portland to Phoenix and then from Phoenix to Pittsburgh in a 20 hour period. In those 20 hours American Airlines delayed me two times making me wait in the airport for a total of 6 hours, and lost my checked bag making me wait another hour. I hardly get time off of work and American Airlines essentially made me spend one of my precious PTO days waiting in an airport. I always say I won’t fly this airline again as this is not the first time something like this has happened. This time I truly will never fly them again. If I could give them less then 1/10 I would. Figure it out American Airlines."
1724,"  Detroit to Dallas via Los Angeles. My buddy and I flew on AA from Detroit to Los Angeles had 2 carry ons, but one of flight attendants ask to take my other carry on bag with her due to overcrowding situation, she said don’t worry about it that I will get my bag at my final destination. So we reached to LAXand got my checked bag and I noticed that the front pouch was totally ripped. We spoke to AA workers at desk, and found out that I was given someone else's bag tag, not mine. AA workers say that my bag was in another location and it will be returned in a few days. I finally got my bag in 3 days. This was not a good experience with AA on my part, next time I will travel with a different airline that will be more cautious and efficient with handling passengers personal items and luggage! Unsatisfied customer."
1725," Flew American Airlines from Tulsa to Baltimore. Late flights and terrible baggage handling, avoid this airline at all costs. Baggage gets left at origin and I am not informed until I reach my destination. I have none of my essentials before a big interview and this airline was in no hurry to deliver my luggage to me even after it arrived at baggage claim the next day."
1726,"  I was supposed to fly Fresno-Dallas-Chicago-Toledo. First flight was delayed almost an hour. Get to Dallas and my flight got delayed until 7am, and then 6am and then 12am and then back to 7am. My connecting flight was at 8am in Chicago meaning I was going to miss it, however I was put on the earliest flight to Chicago that would get me to my connecting flight barely. Then come to find out your system gave away my ticket to Toledo. I complained and was told that yes it was a mistake and that the flight was full. I had a ticket with a seat but because of AA system I lost it? I called and complained to try and get some compensation but was told off by the supervisor because even though it was a mistake by AA all he could do was apologize. He and I went back and forth until he finally hung up on me. I feel very disrespected as a customer.  I am astounded at how I was treated. "
1727,"  Chicago to Orlando. I booked airline tickets for my son, my then husband, and myself in January 2017 for travel from ORD to MCO in April 2017. Then I ended up getting asked for a divorce in early April. I was able to cancel my flight and leave my tickets open in the hope that I could re-allocate my ex-husbands and still be able to take a vacation with my son this year. When it became apparent that I could not take a vacation this year I asked for some sort of a refund from American and cited my divorce as a cause and offered to send the notorized copies of my paperwork to them to prove what caused me to be unable to travel. American refused, saying that this is not an exception and I would get nothing in return and the tickets have to be used by those whose names appear on them. I can neither afford to travel, due to my divorce nor am I willing to contact my ex husband to offer him his ticket. American then said the matter would have no further correspondence. Their complete lack of compassion or any customer service at all has been astounding for such a large airline. I will never travel with them again and urge others to do the same."
1728,"  I fly AA moderately regularly between Philadelphia and San Diego. I often travel with surfboards and pay the $150 each way for this service ($200 internationally). However, AA takes no responsibility for damage to the surfboard even though I am effectively paying for an additional ticket to travel. I think this is completely messed up. This past trip I took a board out to my daughter that she built this past summer. It was packed exceptionally well. Wrapped in bubble wrap, covered in cardboard on all surfaces and more bubble wrap on the rails of the board and the whole thing put into a padded surfboard travel bag. Got it to San Diego and the rails were crushed in two places and there was a big heel dent in the bottom on the board. It was like the baggage handlers went out of their way to destroy the surfboard. OK, AA will pay the damages. Nope, the fine print says they are not responsible and they turn their backs. That's it. Game over. I hate AA big time. But there is no other choice. Good luck."
1729," Greenville to New York. Sat on the tarmac for at least half hour. Then we pull up to gate and everyone is on lunch duty. This past summer I went to Madrid on American, 2.5 hour delay. I finally get off the plane and I run to a different terminal in hopes of catching a earlier flight to NYC. I was supposed to fly into JFK at 10pm on a Sunday. I found two flights to LGA that arrived around 8pm. They say I have to pay a $230 to switch airports or buy new ticket for $150 plus $30 tax. On the flight to Charlotte from JFK I couldn’t even watch TV cause headphone jack was broken."
1730," Montréal to Managua via Miami. I booked a return ticket online. The flight had a 24hr layover in Miami. I figured that my checked in luggage (which I paid 25$cad) would stay at the airport while I go sleep at a hotel near by. I still went to check at the baggage claim if it was there. So I saw my luggage, picked it up and went to the American Airline desk next to the baggage claim. The girl looked annoyed that I asked her why I got my luggage back if I’m flying again with them the next day. I said that I booked only 1 ticket and didn’t want to carry my luggage back and forth and especially not pay to check it in again. She replied rudely that it wasn’t her problem. I questioned her about what to do to solve my situation. She pointed upstairs and told me to ask someone up there. Without any directions to a certain desk. No “thank you” or any form of politeness. My time was running out to catch my hotel shuttle so I was in a hurry. Upstairs I only saw the regular AA check in counter where there was a huge lineup. Unfortunately I didn’t have enough time to make the line and I had to leave with much unnecessary luggage. It’s ridiculous to have to pay twice for luggage to get to my final destination. If I could have chosen a faster flight to Managua I would have done it to avoid this. The girls attitude was totally unprofessional. I don’t think AA really care about their customer service. I’ll remember that when I travel for work with my team and pick a différente airline."
1731,"  San Francisco to Miami. After my sister missed her first flight due to a car accident on the way to the airport, I was able to book a flight for her via American Airlines, I was emailed confirmation and she was emailed the boarding pass. When the plane was about to board the flight agent denied her ticket and put her on standby. They told her they could not find her reservation and even though she had a boarding pass they still denied her. When I called AA to talk to someone about this issue I was told ""its in our records she was late for the flight."" However this is a lie as my sister was waiting at the airport for 3 hours waiting to get onto that flight. I was not only told that my sister was ""lying"" but that ""didn't know what to tell me.""  I will never fly AA."
1732,"  Harrisburg to Orlando via Philadelphia. The flight to Philly was delayed twice for maintenance, the second time leading me to miss my connecting flight. It was then rescheduled and we switched planes. As soon as we all finished boarding the new plane, they made us get back off due to another maintenace issue even though they knew there was a problem before we boarded. I missed my new connecting flight! They then had to send us ON A BUS to make our new connecting flights, that had been changed 3 times at that point. The bus took us to the connecting airport (Philly), where we had to go back through TSA all over again and wait for a few hours for my flight to Orlando, which was my final destination. I was on vacation for 3.5 days, meeting my family in Disney, and by the time I got there I missed out on an entire days worth of activities/reservations. What a waste of money spent on booking this trip! Not to mention it was a waste of one of my very few vacation days that I was lucky to even get approved through work. I was originally to arrive in Orlando before noon, but I ended up getting there that night. This is not the first issue I've had with American Airlines at the Harrisburg airport. I can't even properly do all areas of this review because I wasn't even on a plane for my one ""flight"", I was on a bus! The only positive experience was the fact that the ticketing counter service was decent and worked hard to accommodate our travel needs. Do not recommend flying with them if you're on a timeline!"
1733," Chicago to Las Angeles. I'm a pregnant woman traveling with two young children. American Airlines doesn't let families with small children preboard. My youngest fell asleep and I couldn't wake him up so I had to carry him. I always condense carryon bags into a medium sized duffel until I get on the plane and then I take them out once on the plane (I have to bring a nebulizer and emergency bag with Eli pens and allergy medicine for my 3 year old, so it's easier to carry one bag on/ore the plane than multiple small bags) - and they told me I couldn't bring the bag on. I opened the bag and showed them what was in it, and they made me empty the bag (while carrying my sleeping child) and carry on the bags (5 in total) separately."
1734,"  Houston to Portland via Philadelphia. Rudest customer service representatives, gate attendees and stewardesses I have ever encountered and not just in this trip. Free internet never seems to work. Dealing with a kiosk and rude desk clerks first thing in the morning doesn’t help either."
1735," Washington DC to Minneapolis. Flight cancelled due to de-icing. Poor planning by AA. Sun Country Airlines made it out in time from same airport to same destination (Minneapolis). AA was only able to rebook for next day without reimbursement for hotel or food. The rebooked flight was a one stop flight with a 5 hour layover. Original flight was non-stop. At a later flight with the stop, AA had maintenance problems and changed gate at the last minute. Seriously considering canceling my miles card with them and will definitely chose another airline next time I fly for business!"
1736,  First time with American Airlines my checked baggage came back broken. Second flight I found chewing gum attached underneath. I told the flight attendant who didn’t care. The fourth time (surely my last time with American Airlines) from New Orleans to Miami my baggage still left in New Orleans and I have to wait for 8 days until I got my baggage back.
1737,"  New York to Detroit. Second time flying with American Airlines. First time was our honeymoon in May of 2017. That trip we were delayed 7 times, missed our connection flight, and were provided a hotel room which we were not given any direction on how to get to once we got off the plane and picked up our luggage. The staff was very rude to my wife and I and would not help us. We did get upgraded seats which was nice but that did not change my opinion or experience with American Airlines. The second trip was also an awful experience (Roundtrip from Detroit to New York). On our way home, our flight was delayed once and then later cancelled. I called customer service and tried to see what I needed to do to get another flight. I was about to lose service and told the customer service employee I would call him back because we are about to be disconnected. Before I could call back, the employee booked my wife and I to fly to Charlotte and then to Detroit 8 hours later. I called again and addressed this issue and the employee that time was helpful and told me to wait until I get to the airport to book or change my flight. I arrived at the airport in NY and changed my flight to land in Chicago and catch a connecting flight there to Detroit. We were delayed for over an hour trying to leave NY. Once we landed in Chicago, again we were delayed. Once on the plane, we were delayed again. The staff on the plane was not helpful and also the terminal staff was extremely rude to us. The last flight from Chicago to Detroit, there was a flight attendant who was the first one to actually be kind and helpful to us. I will not choose this airline again."
1738," Basic economy tickets with this airline are a scam. We were shocked to find that the bags that we have always used as carry-ons were now charged $25 each. One of our carry ons was accepted for the flight on the trip out but on the way back we were informed at the gate that it would cost $50 for that one. When we got on the plane we noticed that the passenger next to us, flying with the same economy ticket had a carry on under his seat as big as the one that we just had to pay for! We spent $150 extra in baggage fees over the cost of 3 tickets that we will ask for a full refund for. The customer service was the worst that we have experienced in our many flight travels. I've also attached a picture of my medicine pocket of my bag after they handled it. American Airlines...you get a big zero from us!"
1739, Flew Charlotte - Frankfurt and return at the beginning of December. We opted to use frequent flyer miles so this was a good value in that respect. Both flights left on time and arrived slightly early and the pilots did a good job of alerting us to potential turbulence on the route. The seat back trays were dirty and flight attendants had nothing to clean them with but gave us napkins so we could wipe them ourselves. Seats were okay but no longer have adjustable headrests so not as comfortable as in the past. Cabin crew was what seems to be a typical mix on the legacy carriers - some were pleasant but some were decidedly cranky. Food service was minimal with small portions. Not a big deal for me as I don't tend to eat much on flights but big eaters would definitely be disappointed. Only one beverage service with the meal but drinks (water and juice) were set up in the rear galley so passengers could help themselves. IFE was disappointing. There appeared to be a decent number of options but the touchscreen was very unresponsive and required a lot of effort to move through the menu so I only watched movies and shows from the first page or so. The overall experience was okay and I appreciate the direct flight from North Carolina to Germany but American would not be my first choice for long haul economy as other airlines flying US to Frankfort seem to offer a nice experience.
1740," The aircraft appeared new, at least on the inside and was very clean. The flight was on time. We were given a pad to spread over the seat for sleeping along with the customary blanket and pillow. The seating is in the 1-2-1 configuration with the same controls and hardware that our Cathay Pacific flight had on the first leg of this trip (Los Angeles - Hong Kong), my wife and I had the two center seats. The business section began with row 4. We had access to Cathay Pacific's Bridge Lounge prior to the flight which was comfortable. It was a night flight (leaving at 7.40pm) so we were served dinner soon after lift-off. The meal was average, with a first course that was inedible (grilled cheese served ice cold and so dry it was difficult to cut or chew). I didn't see anyone eat that course-I wonder if AA gets any feedback on food selections that don't get eaten? The second course, scallops for us, was good enough to eat although nothing to look forward to. The flight crew was spotty in that some were attentive and efficient (in my wife's row) and some were harried, inefficient, and surly (my row). On the whole, the crew was nowhere as good and nice as those in the other airlines we flew this trip, which were all Asian airlines so perhaps it's not a fair comparison. Unfortunately, we had flown Cathay Pacific on the flight over to Asia which is a tough airline to compare to in regards to service although frankly any Asian airline we have flown has better flight crews (more service oriented and nicer) than American Airlines' crews. The Captain was informative as we waited to take off, which was nice. The entertainment options didn't include any recent quality movies although some quality older movies were offered (like ""Casablanca""). The crew didn't bother to ask passengers to open windows when we landed in LAX which made landing a bit less comfortable. All in all we were happily surprised with the seats and aircraft but suffered through the kind of service that is characteristic of AA in our experience. This plane did offer wifi although business passengers had to pay for it ($12 for 2 hours was the shortest plan). It took so long to pull up the wifi plan options I figured the service would be to slow and didn't buy it. Apparently AA sees wifi as an additional revenue opportunity rather than a way to enhance business class and make it more competitive with other airlines. We had flown AA on a similar flight returning from Asia a few years ago and it seemed to us that AA is trying to improve their business class and it is better than it was then. Unfortunately for AA in that market the Asia carriers are often as good as it gets in terms of flight crew service which continues to be AA's weak suit."
1741, Not happy with the service heading home to Columbus. My girlfriend and I were able to both bring our carry on from Columbus to DC. From DC to Columbus the guy boarding passengers to the plane said we could not take them on and had to pay 50 dollars each since we did not check them in prior. Nor did he allow us to use the bag measure. I want a full refund for checking my bags. I will never travel with American Airlines again. Customer service I would rate an absolute zero.
1742,"  Sacramento to Colorado Springs via Dallas Ft Worth. Not only was I ignored by the front counter lady, she was rude and continued to ask even how old I was after waiting 30 mins for her to notice I was there. When I tried asking a question she said “be patient.” This doesn’t even start with the fact when I arrived an hour early they told me I had to arrive two hours in order to check my bag so they moved me to the next flight when the first part of this review occurred in Dallas. I recommend unless they get some new employees never flying with this flight. They will for sure never have my business again. I would rather pay an extra 200 dollars than deal with the people boarding American Airlines."
1743,"  Chicago to Albany. In the past year I have travelled around the world and American Airlines is by far the worst I have encountered. Customers are treated with disrespect, not given updated information, and not treated fairly. Flights are delayed and cancelled due to maintenance issues. This airline does not warrant it's name. Pitiful."
1744,"  Sacramento to Charlotte. Terrible customer service. Don't fly Group 9 they treat you like lower class. Don't let you have another bag. They also trick you with their insurance, it's a waste of money. Just poor all around not flying again. I have had two workers from different flights tell me my ticket is worth nothing. I was billed for it and that's money I earn so don't tell me it's not worth anything when I paid money. Sorry I can't drop some dollars on first class doesn't mean you treat people less. Fly any other airline, any other one is better than American"
1745,"  Shanghai to Chicago. Business Class Service. Check in at Pudong smooth. Lounge available was Air China's First Class Lounge B71. Ample hot food available, good selection of beverages and also a bar service. Papers available as well. Nothing special compared to other First Class Lounges, but a freebie. Boarding was about 1 hour early. Orderly and smooth. Had seat 7A on the return. Second Business class cabin on board. Kind of Cozy. Seat 7A was excellent. Seemed like a lot more space, was not anchored with another passengers chair and comfortable enough that I slept for 7 hours... Flight attendants were attentive and friendly. Food service was ok. Taste of the seafood platter was bland, nothing to write home about. FA' came by often, but didn't ask if you'd like refills, just browsed by unless you asked. Did offer a meal before landing, but it was cold and not impressed. Overall a better experience than I expected and they are trying to compete with the Asian Carriers, but they have some room to improve. With that said, I still try them again. "
1746,"  Chicago to Shanghai. Started out at the AA Lounge on Floor Two of the Admiral's Club, which is actually a Flagship Lounge. I did not expect much for a US carriers premium club, but was gladly surprised. Many hot Breakfast items, cold as well along with a host of other assorted goodies. Definitely worth a visit. You only need you boarding pass to show to the desk agent, to gain access. Must be a Business Class member or Ex Plat. Boarded early. Yes, an announcement is made in the club. Had seat 1L on the Boeing 787-8. I felt that it was kind of tight and the anchor was attached to seat 2L. Meaning you felt every movement of the other passenger. Although close to the galley for prompt service, kind of bothersome during the flight. Service was excellent. Food presentation and taste not so much. If you like a good cheese platter, you wont find it here, however, the attention to detail of the FA's very good. Plenty of current and classic DVD's to watch. Overall very satisfied with AA's service, but look to the Asian Carriers for a bit more care all around"
1747,"  Cincinnati to Salt Lake City via Chicago. We purchased flights for our family of six (4 kids under age 6) to go to my husbands sisters wedding (Dec. 21st-25th from CVG-SLC) and my husband just injured his back Monday morning. I sent a letter through the online form to customer relations. Customer relations called me back this morning and said that all they can do is waive the change fee ($200 per person) for future travel because it was a nonrefundable ticket. I asked to talk to someone else. He said there is no one else to talk to and no number I can call and nothing else can be done. This is a family emergency and that is all they can do? They didn't ask to see the doctors note or a history of injuries he has had. It is hard for me to believe that after choosing them over every other airlines, they can be so cold to us. The flight date is not past. They could still fill the seats we won't use and I am sure some other family would be so glad to get to fly during this busy time, as we would have, had this not happened. A refund should be so simple."
1748,"  Charlotte to San Diego. This was a 5 hour flight and this was an ex US Airways A321. It did have the refurbished interior with new seat covers and carpets and overall a fresh clean cabin. But there were still no plugs, no IFE, just Wi Fi and GoGo movie streaming thru the American app (it actually worked very well, no issues at all and a decent selection of movies). But it makes no sense how they can put power ports on their 18 year old Ex US Air A319s but not a 3 year old Ex US Air A321. Nonetheless the seats were very comfortable with acceptable legroom and service was ok, FAs were average for a US airline, Flight left on time and arrived in San Diego 15 minutes early. Only thing I have to say is other than the red stripe on top of the seats the cabin was very very bland. Literally an all grey interior, grey bulkheads with no logos anywhere, grey and navy blue seats, grey carpet, practically all grey livery. Pretty dismal, also the cost for full Wi-Fi access is obnoxious. I bought a messsaging pass for 2 dollars which claimed it worked on skype but Skype said no internet, I could only use iMessage (no SMS) and I couldn't send pictures which was annoying because when I bought GoGo on US Airways in 2014 I could send and post pictures. AA doesn't like to say these Ex US Airways A321s exist, to know what kind of plane you are on look at the plane type on your reservation when you get your ticket. the Ex US Air A321 will be marked ""321"" the new refurbished one with IFE and plugs is marked ""32B"""
1749,"  New York to Los Angeles. American Airlines managed to somehow cancel our tickets that were purchased months previously. The flight was critical for us as we were flying from New York to Los Angeles to connect for our international flight back to Australia later the same day. The first inkling of a potential problem was the day before when I was unable to check in online, so spent hours at an AA office in Manhattan trying to resolve the issue. I was given various explanations but ultimately they accepted no responsibility, asserting that our travel agent in Australia had cancelled or voided the tickets. Again, at the check in counter on the day of the flight, the issue remained unresolved with a supervisor basically saying that our travel agent had ripped us off. We had no alternative but to purchase new tickets (fortunately, I had made a tentative booking the day before in case it was needed, otherwise we would have likely missed our LAX connection considering all flights were full). After returning home, AA repeated their conclusion after investigating the matter that our travel agent had cancelled our tickets which of course they denied so demanded further investigation. Weeks later, American Airlines admitted that the error was theirs all along and offered to reimburse the cost of the new tickets. There was also a gesture of compensation for our inconvenience - a $50 voucher towards another flight on American Airlines - of zero value to us in Australia. Overall, a very disappointing experience given the stress and inconvenience that resulted from their mistake. I would suggest that their staff receive improved training on dealing with such hopefully rare cases - being left in the lurch at a critical time by indifferent staff doesn't leave you with a great impression of an airline."
1750,"  Atlanta to Philadelphia. No more American Airlines, 3 hours delay and they treat passages terribly. I missed my to be at my god daughter's mass today and almost missed a chance to get on the 2nd standby flight. Customer service is worst. They don't even look at my face as talking to me or barely want to talk to me. What kind of business is this? "
1751," This was easily the worst flight I've ever been on and it all comes down to the staff. To begin with, I was in a front row, exit row window seat in their 'economy plus' area. Being in an exit row you typically have to attest that you can step up to the plate if there's an emergency and be capable of doing so. The center seat in my row ended up with an extremely morbidly obese woman who was so large she was literally covering part of my body with her own. Her armpit was resting on my shoulder. The staff did not do anything about this situation. This is first and foremost a safety violation, secondly, I did not pay to be the armrest for another human being. This is unacceptable and the airline should have moved her, myself or made other arrangements for someone so large. When the flight attendant came around with dinner, I politely refused. She stood there, literally staring at me, and barked 'How'd I know you'd say that'? Well, I don't know ma'am - do you normally eat when a strangers armpit is grazing your cheek? Perhaps that's why I declined. When we were getting set to land at LHR we were put into a holding pattern. No biggie, this happens some times. However there was no communication from the captain or crew about how long this would be. Approximately a half hour into this wait I asked the flight attendant if she had any idea how long it would be. She stood in front of me, silently removed her scarf, adjusted it, retied it and then rolled her eyes at me and said ""Honey, this happens to every flight, every day at this airport"" - um, excuse me, it doesn't. I've flown into LHR 8 times in the last 10 months on British Airways and not once have we gone into a holding pattern. Not. Once. At any rate, as that didn't answer my question, I repeated my question. She said ""do you have a layover?"" I told her yes, but that it was a 2.5 hour layover so I wasn't concerned about that so much. I didn't want to scream that I was desperate to get out from under the armpit of the person next to me. She literally walked away saying we'd land soon enough. Not to mention, she left a garbage bag at the bulkhead that was kicked over frequently by people lining up for the toilet. She never once picked up the contents - I did - because I didn't want coffee/juice/whatever was in there staining my suede shoes. I literally purchased the in-fight wifi so I could write them a complaint in real-time. I've never been so fuming at an airline in my life! I'll give their wifi 2 stars since my email was successfully sent while still being squashed and poorly treated mid flight. I will never, ever fly American Airlines again! "
1752," I took 2 trips this month with my son and American are the worst airline to travel with kids. No respect for Moms with kids. My Flight was canceled from Grand Cayman to Charlotte. I was standing for 1 hour and half in line my baby is crying no one try to help you first. Moms with kids don't board first just the worse experience with this airline. On my flight from Dallas to Minneapolis the flight attendant said passed by and said ""oh your kid made a mess"" he was eating crackers what do u expect from a 2 year old?"
1753," I was traveling to Lynchburg, VA for a medical school open house and had many troubles with American Airline. My luggage was delayed, almost missed my connection flight because they had the wrong gate number on the boarding pass and finally my flight was delayed for entire day. Their customer service is terrible, I was not able to get anywhere with them. As a last ditch effort I tried emailing the CEO, and few other big shots of the company to my surprise they actually read their emails and my issues were resolved within the hour of the email. Overall my experience with the airline started off horrible but at the end they took care of me. I was reimbursed for travel expenses additionally given a eVoucher for a new ticket and during my delay they put me in a nice hotel. If you can reach the right people for help American Airline will take care of you! I will definitely fly with them again just not check-in any luggage."
1754," Flew Austin to Washington via Charlotte on American Airlines. Main Cabin Extra on an A321 to CLT. Leg room was fine as was seat comfort. Flight attendants were nice and served a couple rounds of drinks and light snacks. On time dep and arrival in CLT. Newer A319 to DCA in First. Only 8 seats up front made for a cozy cabin and actually very personalized service for a short 58 min flight. Pre-departure beverage, some decent red wine, followed by more beverages and a snack basket once airborne. A good trip, on time and reasonably comfortable. Only negatives, AA's gates are a mess. Large crowds, everyone standing, no resemblance of any order. Delta starts boarding early, which helps and United uses lanes which I really like. AA executives needs to spend some time in the terminal. Boarding is chaotic at best and I'm Exec Plat.on AA."
1755, Reno to St Louis via Dallas. Because of strong wind gusts in Reno our flight was delayed so we missed our connecting flight in Dallas. The agent at the front desk kept us all informed with calmness and good nature. A second desk was opened and we were rebooked the next day for a flight out of Dallas the next day. All American employees were effective and helpful in this situation. As huge as it is the company has its eye on the customers. Good job.
1756," First of all, I would never have flown American Airlines had I had another choice. We fly Alaska Airlines 95% of the time as we have found their customer service superb and we live in the West Coast so it’s most convenient. At this time, however, there is no flight from Philly to Pitt on AK airlines so we booked a second itinerary on American. When we had originally checked in, they would not link our two separate itineraries even though Alaska Airlines did flying down. So we will have to get our bags from baggage claim and drop them, then go through the whole process of checking in our bags/security before our next leg of our long journey home. Apparently, American is undergoing ""budget cuts"" (literally, one of the gate attendants said this) and when you buy a ticket it’s not the same as buying a seat. So you have to pay extra to verify that you A) get a seat and B) get to sit with your party on the plane. Alaska Airlines does not ever make us do this. Again, the woman at the gate had deplorable customer service skills, very rude and curt. Not sympathetic or apologetic at all. She said to ""calm down"" even though I was obviously less than pleased but not acting out in any way. We almost weren’t going to get on our flight because they overbooked — are you surprised? Luckily, two passengers were willing to take a later flight for incentive allowing us to get on the plane. It seems that Americans Airlines is clearly struggling financially and in their professional development of staff. They might as well just close up shop because no one recommends flying on their airline anyway. If I pay $600 RT for a ticket from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh I expect to have a seat and be greeted with a smile. That should not be so much to ask. I have heard Alaska Airlines is adding a leg from Seattle to Pitt. I’ll be glad and happy to pay them for a seat on that flight in the future."
1757,"  On a previous trip from Columbus to Chicago, my flight was delayed twice and then rebooked for the next day. A trip the following month, my flight was delayed two hours, leaving passengers on the flight for an hour in their seats, first due to paperwork for maintenance that wasn't completed, then due to crew needing a break. I was hesitant to fly American again for my trip in November, but booked anyways giving it another chance. Arriving to the airport and waiting at my gate, the time came for boarding and my flight wasn't on the screen. I checked and the gate had been switched. I went to the new gate and they told me my gate was changed again. I went to the new gate again and they said that my flight was at the old gate, but that it had been delayed by an hour and a half without any reason. Now, arriving to the airport for my return flight, knowing it was going to be delayed, I found out it was in fact delayed again by an hour. I refuse to fly American Airlines again."
1758," As always, am never disappointed at being continually disappointed by American Airlines. They have a new policy: they do not check luggage from one of their flights to another of their flights if it is on a separate reservation. If I had booked the tickets on the same passenger name record, it would have cost $2,000 more. American Airlines (along with UAL) seems to revel in seeing how much lower they can plumb the depths of customer service. Although I am platinum elite with this company, on this itinerary they tried twice to collect $25 for a checked bag onto an international flight for a Platinum member (two reasons why the checked luggage is free - want a third? I have an AA credit card). Then they tried to blame Alaska Airlines (a very bizarre attempt to shift responsibility). Delta checks luggage onto Air France and KLM and any other carrier they have a baggage agreement with, and so does UAL (even though I would avoid them because no one wants to be dragged off the airplane and beaten in the gate lobby). AA doesn't even have a ticketing/baggage agreement with AA anymore, so I guess not only are passengers blackballing the company but other airlines as well. In addition, with my platinum status I am supposed to have access to their lounges on international bookings. However, it was refused me this time b/c the connexions were extending past 24 hours even though every connexion was valid and legal. I spoke to a supervisor in the Admirals Club, but it seems AA doesn't empower any of its staff to make logical business decisions in order to serve the public. I was told I could pay $59 for a perquisite that is supposed to be gratis. By the time I made it over to the AA Eagle concourse at LAX, I was then within this 24-hour window and could use the lounge. Like I said, they seem to relish putting their thumbs in the eyes of the public, and I blame the airline companies in America (not in Europe where they are without exception gracious and hospitable to their passengers) for the increase in ""air rage"" incidents by always doing their best to enrage the public with their fees and poor service. This is not a problem in Europe where you are treated as a human being. Not in America - there, you are just a member of a crowd they have to control."
1759," Flew Albuquerque to Chicago. Toilets out-of-service on aircraft. Discovered also that the lamps above my row and the electricity were out. I notified the steward and asked to be reseated. He refused saying that there were no seats. I told him I could see seats right in front of me. He told me that you have to pay for those seats. I told him that I was Platinum Elite and am entitled to complimentary Main Cabin Extra seats. Rather than handling the situation before him diplomatically and with grace toward a valued traveler, he replied, ""well, if you really are Platinum Elite then you know you cannot change seats onboard."" The abrasiveness and discourtesy was so breathtaking I didn't pursue it further. When dealing with primitive people, it is best not to anger them. There is a new something special in the air with American Airlines: If their cabin crew cannot get themselves out of a jam with a passenger in a bad situation they themselves have created and aggravated, then they try to have you arrested when you land."
1760,"  Houston to Miami. After purchasing my ticket I was notified I would have to pay an additional 25 dollar fee to check my bag at the gate. I was fine with This until I was notified it would be 50 dollars instead of 25. After asking why this was the case the attendant rudely stated it's an additional 25 dollars at the gate and I should have paid when I checked in. I told her I checked in online and would happily have paid before going through security if i knew. She rolled her eyes and stated do you want to get on your flight or not. I pulled up the email where it stated you will pay an additional 25 dollars at the gate if you have to check a bag. She stated exactly, 25 dollars additional at the gate and I should have known I check my bag at the counter before security. I paid the 50 and will never fly American again. They are extremely rude and have zero empathy. When buying the ticket it should clearly state it will be 50 dollars to check at the gate and 25 at the counter. I feel like I've been robbed."
1761,"  Cancun to Charleston via Miami. After sitting on the plane for two hrs we finally take off, when landing in Miami with enough time to get through customs and make our flight American Airlines sends us to line where we stand for 45 mins and still with time to spare say they can’t keep us on our flight (most likely gave our seats away). They book us on another flight 5 hrs later and as a “sorry” give us a $24 voucher. I will never fly American Airlines again. This is absolute garbage and completely ruined our honeymoon. Maybe focus on customer service and not money!"
1762," My husband and I were traveling home the day after thanksgiving flying from Phoenix to Minneapolis. We checked in online, had been through security early and waited at our gate. When we boarded, a gate attendant starting asking my husband a question about our carry on luggage but we could not understand her. She was telling us to go back up the tarmac to measure our bag to make sure it fit. We assured her it did we travel often. Another gate attendant proceeded to take the suitcase out of our hands and tell us we had to check it or we would have to take the next flight. I grabbed ahold of our bag as they started pulling it from me and told them I needed something out of it. They started yelling at us to board the plane. They kept yelling it won’t fit it won’t fit. It was such a bizarre interaction how they started threatening us the plane would leave without us and a flight attendant stood in the door and watched this unfold. Our seats were in row 13 and the entire overhead compartment above our seat was empty. The pilot came up to us and asked if there was a problem and I said yes they took our bags and said it wouldn’t have fit, there is plenty of room right here. He replied “I don’t see any bag.” From telling us we had “5 seconds” to board the plane and that they were going to put us on the next flight when we were still early boarding (and still sat on the plane for 15 minutes before take off) I honestly don’t know what the motive was except to attack us both verbally and physically by pulling my bag from me."
1763,"  Sydney to New York via Los Angeles. Booked a seat, Oh no a ticket on the plane it was not a seat as I was told, even though you have to pay to get a better seat it's just still a ticket. Ordered Vegetarian for my daughter for return flights as she does not eat meat. On the way over they told her nothing was ordered and were the most rudest people to her about it, they offered her nothing to eat as an alternative and actually told her go and complain about it! So I called the office and let them know of their staff’s rudeness and that on a 15 hour long haul flight she was starving! They ensured me that they had it arranged for the return flight and I also upgraded her seat to give her an exit row seeing she is tall to give her more leg room. Yes the meal this time was correct, the staff though were the same rude people, must be a trait for AA. But her seat was broken, - they offered her nowhere else to move told her once again go complain. I have since read so many bad reviews, that I wished I had read before making the booking. It was a special trip for my daughters birthday to NYC to see her sister. American Airlines Customer service is the worst she had ever encountered in her life she said, you should maybe put some money into training your staff if they are having a bad day, which seems to be every day do not take it out on your paying customers as they are the ones who will not return."
1764," I purchased a $5,000 business class ticket and was later advised by email that AA lost the services of its food service company. I asked for a refund to buy a ticket on another airline that offered a business class service, but was told I had a write a letter to request a refund. I was served chips, grapes and pizza pops on the 15 hour flight. I was offered a $200 refund, but was told I had to wait in line after the 15 hour flight to get the coupon. The worst part of this experience was that I checked on the AA website and they were selling the same flights that week, with no mention of the catering issues. I would recommend anyone flying on AA through LAX should find another airline!"
1765,"  New York JFK to San Diego. I cannot even explain what a terrible experience I had on American Airlines. The service was poor,  cleanliness was terrible, the food options were bad,  etc. I flew on Alaska on my way to New York and it was great! Such kind, helpful service. Everything about that experience was quite the opposite of my experience on American. To end what was already a bad flight, I received my luggage to discover that my $300 coat had been stolen out of it. American did nothing to help the situation. "
1766,  Philadelphia to London with American Airlines. I fly first class international and working the US often. I travel for business and vacations with my family. Unfortunately I find the treatment of women routinely less kind and cordial than that of my male counterparts. It's absurd.
1767,  Omaha to Chicago. Terrible! There were many empty seats. They will charge you for your every luggage 60$ each. You will also be asked to give up your seats if you seem weight heavier. A lot of customers were not satisfied during the flight.
1768,"  Norfolk to Philadelphia. A couple weeks ago I was disallowed to fly with American Airlines. My father and I had booked a trip to Thailand 3 months in advance and waited in the airport for hours as they tried to figure out what was wrong. As time flew by and they were trying to figure out we were there three hours early to check in and missed our flight due to them telling us my Father had fraudulent activity in his card. I can’t even explained how embarrassing it was. He called his card he used to pay for the trip right in front of them and the lady told them “ He doesn’t even have a balance, it’s paid off. There is no fraudulent activity on this card. They bounced the ball off the wall a little more then switched from my Father to me saying I had fraudulent activity on my card. Funny thing is my dad payed for the trip not me. I’ve never flown or attempted to fly with American Airlines in my life. They then said that I could fly but I would have to pay in cash for a ticket to Thailand that day which was $6000. We booked our flight and rooms for about $1000 each.  We were not refunded our money. I have tried to contact corporate office several times a day since the incident and still no response. .Before this I had heard a few negative things about American Airlines but not enough to deter me from flying with them. They ruined a huge trip and still haven’t given us a reason because I guarantee there isn’t one. "
1769," San Francisco to Montevideo via Miami on Nov. 7, and return on Nov. 15-16. All flights were on time. Both flights between SFO and MIA (# 931 and 967) were on a new-looking A321 with great AVOD and with smiley cabin crews that were constantly around and eager to help. There were two rounds of drinks and a cookie on these 6-hour flights; the optional food for sale was tasty but expensive. The flights between MIA and MVD (# 989 and 984) were on an old-looking B763 with archaic video screens on the ceiling, small overhead bins, and a mostly friendly and efficient cabin crew, though 1 or 2 of them looked like they didn’t want to be there (on # 984 they didn’t even distribute headphones for the movie or audio service unless passengers requested them) and a male attendant consistently skipped passengers during drink rounds and never acknowledged a “thank you”. The other attendants tried to make up for these slackers. On these 9-hour flights, a small but edible dinner was served 1 hour after departure, followed by a minimal breakfast 1 hour before landing. I suggest bringing a small blanket (all flights were very cold) and a thin pillow (seat padding wasn’t great). Desk and gate agents were friendly and moved things along quickly. Overall, across the four legs of the trip, I had a good experience for a very affordable price, much better than I was expecting from reading many reviews here. I would recommend and fly AA again, trying to avoid their B763 planes. As a side note: I was expecting a more meaningful “preferred boarding” experience for having an AA-associated credit card. On the MIA-SFO flight, by the time I reached my row 9 seat, all overhead space was taken all the way through row 14, so I had to become the dreaded passenger who needs to move down the aisle against the flow of traffic during boarding and deplaning."
1770," Flew American Airlines from Miami to Charlotte. Flight was late 30 minutes because of flight crew mix up and now we have been waiting over an hour for our bags at baggage claim. Its now 1.20am, no announcements, just people asleep that don't care about the customers waiting. 3 other flights have come and gone. Where is the customer service?"
1771,"  Flew Orlando to Washington, D.C. This my 4th flight in a row with American Airlines where they have moved my seat after booking. I specifically selected either window seats for all my flights. When you are 6ft 3 inches the other seats just don't work. I'm tired of paying for a specific seat and getting bumped to a middle seat every time. I will be sure to share my experiences with everyone I know. Thus based strictly on the customer service of the airline."
1772,❎ Not Verified |  Worst flight crew I have ever experienced. It takes a little over an hour of flight time from Arizona to Las Vegas. However it took us over an hour playing musical chairs. For some reason American Airlines could not get it right with the seating chart. They was a mom and daughter who was given completely different airline passes. They boarded the plane and then realized they had the wrong boarding pass. Scary that can happen. None the less we sat on the tarmac for an hour and a half watching the flight crew switch people from seat to seat. 
1773,"  Denver to Quito via Dallas/Ft. Worth. So we planned an awesome trip to the Galapagos and made the mistake of purchasing plane tickets to Quito Ecuador on American Airlines. I made the horrible mistake of screwing the time up and arriving at the Denver airport with only 45 minutes before the plane was scheduled to leave. When we got to the ticket counter the American Airlines (AA) ticket agent told us that they closed acceptance for luggage 5 minutes ago, so they don't let us on our flight because of 5 minutes! This is where we really got shafted because we asked them to find us another flight to get to Quito and they did, but they gouged us for an extra $2500, which was $1500 more than the original cost of the tickets, we were furious, but with all the other reservations and time taken off work what could we do but let them take advantage of us, so we paid. The ironic rub to that flying out experience was the return flight from Quito, which AA delayed over 3 hours and only gave the excuse that it was ""legal"" issues. When I complained to them in an email they admitted that they didn't plan well enough in this computer age for a flight that had been scheduled for months to be able to have pilots that were rested enough to make that flight according to the FAA, so they held the flight until the pilots were legally rested. So this corporate giant wouldn't hold our outgoing flight 5 minutes so they could load our luggage, but they didn't mind messing up every passengers connecting flights on our return flight because of their own lazy planning. I'm never flying on AA again and if you can avoid it you shouldn't either."
1774,"  Denver to Norfolk. I used to love American Airlines. The planes are comfortable and normally the service is great. Plus, they take care of their Active Duty military, such as myself, but the last time that i flew, I had a lock on my bag get cut off, and had my PS4 pro, controller, and power cord get stolen. Ive flown my PS4 before many times with no problems. No one has ever cut the lock to get to the items."
1775,  Miami to Houston. I found the flight to be most enjoyable. Refreshments were available for purchase. No problems were encountered.with either the check in or the flight itself. Miami airport is a great airport to fly out of.
1776,"  Miami to Raleigh Durham. At the boarding, the attendant determined my carry-on needed to be checked stating that my bag was big, to which I replied that I always use the same carry-on and it was extremely lightweight. Then she stated that there was not enough space in cabin, and she checked my carry-on. I entered the plane and to my surprise there were plenty  of empty room across the plane and on top and front of my seat #28, more than two compartments empty near me! This situation is unpleasant, uncomfortable and shows lack respect for customers who as myself, prepare in advance for a faster way of moving between airports."
1777," Was very disappointed in first class service on an international route from Santa Ana to Rome via Dallas. First flight, SNA-DFW boarded aircraft and no one offered to hang my coat. Had to locate the closet and do it myself. Was seated 75m before offered a drink, and then 5m later before I'd even taken a sip my food was brought. I asked her to put it back into the oven until the happy hour was over. Flight from DFW - FCO also problematic. Had to ask two different staff how to put down the table. I had pre-ordered the duck and it was really awful, like what I'd imagine they'd serve in prison. Not a first class experience at all (I remember flying JFK - LHR on Pan Am and they carved meat for the meal right from the cart). An hour before the flight landed, I was asked to return my headphones so had no inflight entertainment last hour of flight. Why can they not do their housekeeping duties after all the passengers have left? They seem to have a checklist of duties to perform and they just want to rush through with no care for the inflight experience of the passengers. Quite a different attitude than from AF, KL, LH, OS, LX, or BA (even though BA is racing to the bottom to meet the service standards of Easy Jet and Ryan Air -- they charge £3 for a car of coca cola and there are no meals on board anymore). I returned on AA in Economy and had a better in-flight experience (the meal was good). Very disappointed and First Class costs $3,600 one-way I note."
1778,  San Diego to Pittsburgh via Philadelphia. I am sorry for the poor review I am going to give. The staffs at the check in and the gates were rude and unprofessional. They focussed on charging 50 dollars for a carry on item. I do not mind paying if that's the rule and did so graciously. What matters most is the way 'ill trained' staff treat you. Sorry American Airlines. It used to be one of highly professional flights a few years ago. Good luck in recuperating the business. My last flight with them.
1779,"  Due to fly from Philadelphia to Orlando. Horrible, horrible. We were supposed to land in Orlando for 8.59, instead we were in Tampa. That's okay because of a problem in Orlando, but to give out water and no food vouchers with no idea of what time our families will eat. May I add my luggage is still on the plane and I have to wait to take my meds. I will never take American Airlines again."
1780,"  Our plane was delayed 30min from SFO. We got to PHX at 7.20. The flight was completely full. We asked the flight attendant to assist us to deplane as we needed to catch a connecting flight to Austin at 7.43. She said we have plenty of time and she can't do anything to help us. We ran to our gate which was all the way on the other end of the terminal. PHX airport is massive and it took us 20+ minute sprinting to our gate. If anyone who knows PHX airport, we went from gate A23 to gate B26. Got the our gate at 7.40 but the plane had closed it doors. Apparently the gate agent let the gate closed without us. They didn't even call or announce our name. So we end up paying for our hotel and got a standby ticket for the following day. Never again. This will be my last trip with this airline. The last time we flew with Southwest, they opened the door for their passenger who was late."
1781,"  Raleigh Durham to Cancun. I've traveled American Airlines for years, multiple trips with the same luggage. Today my carry on was suddenly too big by 1/2 inch so they made me check it. Needless to say, rude personnel was the start. Upon boarding, there was multiple bags larger than mine, very confusing. On board the employee rudeness continued. Everyone was very unfriendly and had poor attitudes. American Airlines has lost my business forever! To boot, flight is delayed and no one is prepared for the flight."
1782,"  Booked to fly from Seattle to Indianapolis. First off, this is my fourth (and final) flight with American Airlines in the past month. Every single flight has been delayed for one reason or another resulting in me missing two flights. Then when you go to the agent and set up a new flight that's not for five more hours they act like they're doing you a favor by moving you up two rows in the flight. I won't be flying American anymore, I shouldn't have strayed from Alaska/Delta."
1783,"  Charlotte to Wilkes Barre. This will definitely be the last time I will ever fly this airline. I asked downstairs if my carry on baggage was ok size and they informed me it was ok then I get to the gate and because I am zone 9 then I am not allowed to have a suitcase it has to be a duffel bag. Then I was told I had to check it or rebook for in the morning. So I had to pay the $50 and I could have checked it downstairs for only $25!  American Airlines guess that's one way to get money, but definitely not the honest way to get it. The plane is NOT full so there is more than enough room for my 1 bag!"
1784,"  Flew Las Vegas to Miami. American Airlines is usually one of my last airlines of choice. But in this case, price and schedule left me no choice, so AA it was. While they continue to try to find ways to cram more people on their planes, and seating is definitely tight, in this case, since it was a red eye, I fortunately managed to sleep through the flight despite being not very comfortable. The flight left on time and arrived a little early and I mostly slept through it, so I guess that's a win! The A321 had inflight entertainment provided via ones own device and wifi. I did not attempt to use it. One thing about AA and MIA is there is a very long walk from the terminal to where the baggage claim is and it took maybe 15 more minutes after this walk before luggage arrived. In this case, the price of the flight was good, I got to my destination safely on time, and I slept through the flight. However, I still do not like American and only chose them when I do not have another choice as they are the dominant carrier out of Miami."
1785,"  Well this is my first and will be my last time flying American Airlines. I am on the plane as we speak to fly from Toronto to New York LaGuardia. Just got a notification that the plane will not depart until 07.30 as opposed to the 06.30 scheduled time. And to be quite honest, I already wasn’t too pleased by the counter staff at YYZ. They were extremely slow and did not seem very motivated to do their job. Seemed liked they were taking their sweet old time despite the long line up. I’ve never experienced anything so slow when travelling with other airlines. Another gentleman in the line also complained how slow the check in staff were. Now in terms of the flight delay, the pilot stated that there were mechanical issues that needed to be looked at and that the issue was not too serious. Well this obviously makes me nervous. So yeah, I won’t be flying with this airline again. I regret not booking with another airline. Thank goodness I’m not flying AA on my return to YYZ."
1786,"  Miami to Charleston. American Airlines used to understand customer service. The customer service supervisor at the baggage desk at the Miami airport on Monday night, 11/6/2017 told me that it was not her fault I was stupid. I may not be a genius, but is that customer service, or appropriate management terminology towards customers? If you want service that is less satisfactory than robots, apparently American Airlines is for you. I’ve never been so disrespected in an airport in my 30 years of air travel. "
1787,"  Dallas to Chattanooga. This is my first and last trip on American Airlines. I flew from Chattanooga to Dallas and the attendant at the Chattanooga airport was so incredibly rude. Then, coming back from Dallas to Chattanooga, we had to wait for at least 15 minutes to depart the plane because they couldn't find a marshall to flag it in. What a joke! And Chattanooga could do so much better since the city is growing so rapidly. Bring in Southwest! They are the best and most efficient. I would rather drive to Nashville or Atlanta then fly from my hometown on this joke of an airline!"
1788,  Sacramento to Scranton Wilkes-Barre. The nightmare started in Sacramento. We took a 1.5 hour delay for a door assist bottle being 500 psi to low for dispatch. I'm a licensed aircraft mechanic myself. So I can tell you with absolute certainty that this is part of a daily check by the flight attendants as well as maintenance. They waited until the airplane was fully boarded before someone noticed. This is avoidable if there maintenance department/flight attendants were doing there job. Since I took the delay on this flight it screwed up the rest of my trip. I missed the next connecting flight. Ended up waiting for hours until I was able to depart. Oh wait now I have an extra stop! I get to Philadelphia and this flight takes a 75 minute delay. I've had it with this airline and will be seeking an alternative route or airline in the future. Stay away from these people. They don't deserve to represent the country with that name.
1789,  Flew American Airlines from Dallas Fort Worth to Philadelphia. My family and I have never had such poor service until today. The flight attendants were so rude and disrespectful. They were serving other passengers and were talking to all passengers rudely. I asked for my complimentary cookie and they both acted as though we were stealing from them. Then I asked for coffee and she asked the other attendant - 'what does she want' in a ugly manner. Then she slammed the sugar on the tray. I cannot believe attendants are able to treat people this way. If you don't like your job then quit and allow someone else to be happy at what they do.
1790,"  Raleigh Durham to New York JFK. I been traveling with American Airlines for a long time now and never had a bad experience even with delays. However, Communication of the staff in this airline is terrible. The plane was delayed because of fog but it wasn’t communicated until arrival at a different airport. The inconvenience of this airline cause delayed for a special event I needed to attend. Even when finally arriving at JFK, they said we would arrive in 20 minutes, they been flying more than an hour in circles around the airport. I was very concerned and worry what was going on and no one can tell me why we haven’t landed yet. Recently, I try calling to change the time on my reservation departure time. They was very rude on the phone and can’t seem to help me or even give me a option. I will never travel with America Airlines again."
1791," Dallas to Toronto. American Airlines is really struggling to deliver any form of consistent service. This was another example of a failure to deliver acceptable levels of customer service. The gate staff and cabin crew were disinterested in their job. Customers were really a distraction. Telephoning their call centre is an exercise in patience - I waited for just shy of an hour to speak to someone. When I did they were unable or unwilling to provide the assistance I required. The only good thing I could say about the flight was that my bag arrived. Sadly, American Airlines seems to be struggling on just so many fronts."
1792," I took American Airlines AA109 flight LHR-LAX (Economy) just over a month ago. And let me tell you, it was nice: you left the plane with a great feeling rather than a standard one! While it is hard to describe what exactly went so well, I will try - the crew: this was probably most important. The crew was very nice and helpful throughout the flight. They brought more water all the time (very important on planes) and was just always there when you needed something. They would also take your trash with them, even when they were just passing by. Some were a little bit stressed toward the end of the flight but that was ok since they were working hard. This was especially obvious after I took my flight back with Iberia from MIA-MAD where it took them a full 2.5 hrs after takeoff to serve drinks for the first time. It was an overnight flight and people wanted to use the time to sleep. I snagged a main cabin extra seat for free using my status, so I had additional legroom, that was great! Also the lavatories were still very clean, even after 11.5 hrs of flight. As we all know, economy class food isn’t especially known for its quality. What we had though, was very good for economy. It was fried chicken in Chinese sweet sauce or something with rice. The sides were fine, as was the breakfast. I was really impressed. (Dinner was also tasty on Iberia but the breakfast was just average I’d say). In the rear part of the plane, the crew had two nice sets of snacks and soft drinks for everyone to have as much as they’d like. They also constantly refilled everything and you could ever ask them for other things they didn’t put out there. Also, they would talk to passengers, it was like a place to socialize! Really amazing for economy. The only thing I didn’t enjoy so much was the temperature. While it was ok for lots of people, I often think it’s a lil bit cold on the planes but the crew assured me, they would turn the heating up a bit for me. Didn’t help so much after all, but that’s ok. As you can see, American Airlines is not as bad as lots of people say. Personally, I enjoyed my time on the plane!"
1793,"  On time departure from Vancouver, attentive cabin attendants, good breakfast served. Comfortable seats, good selection of movies, etc. On time arrival into DFW. After a 5 hour layover, boarded next 7pm flight at 6.15pm. Left the gate at at 6.50 and then sat on the ground for three hours with only one announcement from the cockpit to the effect that there was a ""problem"" which was being addressed, Eventually announcement that we were going back to the gate. After 40 minutes at the gate, problem apparently solved and we took off. Fifteen minutes into the flight captain informs that we are returning to DFW as problem still not resolved. Landing complete with fire brigades and ambulances waiting on the side of the runway. On arrival at the gate we are informed flight is now cancelled and we need to disembark. Back at the gate counter, vouchers for hotel and meals are handed out. Assigned hotel, Hyatt, within a 5 minute walk from the gate. Next day the now 10am flight closed the door at 10.30 was already wondering whether we were ever going to leave Dallas after all. Once in the air, service was good, drinks and lunch served followed by ""breakfast"" at 9pm one hour before landing. Cabin crew very attentive."
1794,"  
Flew American Airlines from Buenos Aires to Las Vegas via Miami. Smooth check in, on time boarding and departure. Service is pleasant enough with lunch being served at 10am (this was an early morning departure). Lie flat individual seats very comfortable. Good pillow and blanket. Plenty of films and live BBC/CNN/Sports channels. Arrival into Miami on time and then the usual hassle to go through immigration. Note: allow plenty of time for this, at least 2 1/2 hours before a connecting flight. MIA-LAS flight uneventful, pleasant service in First CLass with only a cheese and fruit plate being served for this 9pm flight. On time arrival."
1795,"  Flew from Detroit to New York with American Airlines. I will never fly this airline again. This is the second time in two months in which my flight has been cancelled. Granted this past experience was due to weather, but the rebooking process has been painful and a full day delayed. Good thing I work for a company that is flexible and didn’t need to take a vacation day due to this. The first time it happened, I drove overnight to reach my destination in time - American was useless in even trying to look through other airlines. And when I requested a refund I was told I had to go online and request it. What? I’m on the phone with you after waiting over an hour to speak to a human and you can’t just put something into the computer to apply a refund for a flight I can’t use because of a cancellation outside of my control? Pathetic. This time? Got rebooked for a flight a full day later that was then delayed another 2 hours. Well worth paying an extra $100 to not have to deal with cancellations."
1796,"  Flew American Airlines from Dallas Fort Worth - London Heathrow in C on a B777-300. Arrived from a domestic flight and transfer in DFW hassle-free, but involved an (easy) change of terminals. DFW is probably one the very best transfer airports in the U.S. AAdmirals Club in DFW was nicer than others I have been to, but offerings very minimal and sub-par for an international flight. Food and ""premium"" drinks for purchase at steep airport prices. Coffee/tea, soft drinks for free. Basic beer and wine available from a manned bar (this is the U.S., so ""free"" means ""for tips""). WIFI was reliable. Overall, definitely not comparable to the lounge experience offered by non U.S.-based airlines. Boarding fairly orderly and cabin crew good and friendly. Seats in C are in a herringbone 1-2-1 configuration. Same seats as CX and these are one of the best seats in C for space and comfort. IFE was AVOD, selection good, Bose headphones supplied, screen not very responsive, but visually good. However, irritating ads before every selection, that could not be skipped or fast forwarded. Dinner (chose the quinoa crusted prawns) was actually tasty on this flight and quality in line what I would expect in transatlantic business class. It was a night flight, so tray service, but service did not feel rushed just to get it over with. Drinks selection good as well and with regular top ups. New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc was a good choice. Slept thru breakfast, so cannot comment on it, but FA’s offered to bring some coffee just before landing, which was much appreciated. Catering out of AA’s hub in DFW seems to be superior to that out of other locations. Cabin crew professional, obviously experienced and good, even friendly. On-time departure and on time arrival (more or less). Good experience and nothing to complain about. Comparing to other carriers I have used in C over the Atlantic: as for Oneworld alternatives AA is way ahead of BA (especially due to seating arrangement on AA’s B777-300 vs. BA’s high density 2-4-2 seating), probably in line with AY, but not quite on the level of IB. Also, I would rate the overall experience on Star Alliance’s OS and LX higher, but again AA did good on this flight. Recommended, if you are on B777-300 (seating can be much inferior on other planes types)."
1797,"  Dallas Ft Worth to San Diego. American Airlines is simply the worst airline! I would and will never fly American Airlines ever again! There is 0 leg room, the employees are rude, and their bag fees are disgusting! $50 to check a carry on bag. The lady mentioned it's a ""New"" rule. Are you kidding me? It's a new rule you charge for a carry on?  I would be embarrassed to run or work for a company like this. The last time I flew with American there flight was late by 2 hours and we ended up missing our connecting flight because of it and that flight was the last flight out so we were stuck and had to pay an extra $100 for a hotel and I ended up missing my sisters wedding. Then when we landed we were stuck on the flight for 2 hours on the runway. American Airlines is a nightmare.  My time is worth more and I refuse to support a company this horrible"
1798,"  Miami to Albany. I don’t even know where to start with this airline company. I have dealt with issues since booking my flights for my honeymoon. The customer service is horrible! The first issue I dealt with when booking was over the phone. We wanted to switch our flights to a different time so we wouldn’t miss our cruise ship. The flight we had originally booked was cutting it close. Ended up finding another flight (price was less than we paid) when we went to change the flights I had to deal with about 15 different people trying to tell me that I needed to pay more money for switching the flight. After days and numerous people we ended up just booking and paying the extra money. Be careful because if you go On the site and show that you’re looking at a flight the price will raise from when you first looked at it. Next issue was coming home we arrived to the Miami airport. Checking into the flight the day before we got on our boarding passes a certain area to board. When we got to the airport, they changed the gate again and gave us paper boarding passes, then it got close to boarding time and we realized no one was boarding. So I looked on the app and it gave us another area so we rushed there realizing that was also the wrong gate. Our gate for changed 4 different times without being notified. So we ended up Missing our flight. The gate was on the other side of the airport. When talking to the customer service about switching our flight they were very rude telling us that their was nothing they could do and it was our fault that we didn’t know. Never an apology or anything reassurance they were going to help us get home safe. Customer service is horrible with this company. I can’t even believe what I have dealt with. I will never fly American Airlines again."
1799,"  Flew American Airlines from New Delhi to Baltimore via Atlanta. Staff are rude. Food below expectation. Seat selection Nil. Utterly bad experience. Rudely asked at Atlanta if I was really seated in a Business class seat by airline staff. They had chosen me the Hindu meal without my consent. No choice, no change, so had to consume what was thrown at me."
1800,"  American Airlines couldn’t find the pilot for the flight 5010 from Philadelphia to Manchester NH, the gate agent said that we were almost ready to board a couple times. Then she announced that they needed to locate the captain and had been calling him. The woman next to me said that she didn’t want to go on the flight if they did find that captain. Who doesn’t call in when they will miss a flight (what could he have been doing?)  Then, the gate agent announced that they had found another pilot. This pilot #2 was a passenger on another plane but agreed to fly this plane. We were delayed but did get to Manchester. At least the gate agent was honest enough to say what was going on. I was supposed to fly into Portland, ME but that flight was abruptly cancelled. And my friends were nice enough to pick me up in New Hampshire, for which I am thankful, or the vacation would have been cancelled."
1801,"  Flew American Airlines from Tampa to Dallas. On-time direct round-trip flights on clean aircraft. Paid for extra legroom and earlier boarding, light hand baggage only. Human contact with AA staff was limited to boarding at the gate and trolley service on the DFW-TPA sector, but all were courteous and motivated. A 21st century flying experience with no bother."
1802,"  Los Angeles to London. Awful experience flying with American Airlines. Crew was reluctant to assist during check in, when passport scanners did not work. The seats are the smallest I have ever sat in, staff was unfriendly to passengers on numerous occasions (a male flight attendant on helping an older man with his luggage: “i can’t lift that”), overall they seem not to like their customers very much. On top of that it was very hot in the cabin and lastly, they only came around with drinks twice on a 10 hour flight. I will never fly with them again, if I can prevent it."
1803,"  
Flew American Airlines from San Diego to Dallas Fort Worth in F on an Airbus 321 (with US Airways livery). Web Check-in worked fine and bag drop at a manned premium counter as I flew F, but in Y everything is do it yourself, except for weighing of the bags. TSA friendly and fast with short lines. SAN seemed to be an easy and well managed airport. No Admirals Club at SAN. Boarding orderly and uneventful. Cabin Crew professional and not necessarily unfriendly, but even in F rather short and devoid of any charm and warmth. No IFE on board, but WIFI was supposedly available for a fee. Lunch served was either a salad with salmon (edible, but not great) or quinoa with vegetables and cheese (cheap choices and definitely not in line with expectations for a flight of 4 hours in F or C). Seats were standard domestic First recliner seats and comfortable enough for a 4 hour daytime flight. Flight departed and arrived on time, which was good. Rather average for a U.S. domestic flight, but below average in most other markets, a painless experience with no particular highlights other than an on-time arrival. And, way better than my last experience in F with UA."
1804, Out of two flights (Oklahoma to San Diego via Dallas) one was so late missed my connection and on the way back it was delayed 3 hours. Seats so narrow I have to sit high and tight. American Airlines is my off the list! 50% failure rate to arrive on time. If you connect in Dallas give yourself 2 hours arrival time to boarding call. AA also charged me 75$ to fly standby on an earlier flight! I am helping them fill seats and they nick me for 75$.
1805,"  Miami to New York. I will never fly with American Airlines again.  I've been flying with them the last 10 years but the mistreatment of my last flight this morning, I won’t give this airline another penny! From the service when it was time to board my flight, the staff were so rude."
1806," First flight of the morning the plane breaks. My husband and I wait 2 hrs trying to reroute our flight from Charleston to Charlotte. American had another plane fly in to replace broken plane. So our 6:15 departure is now 12:15 then 1:00 then 1:40. We did not pay extra to upgrade our seats so it seems that they will split up seats bought together so you cannot sit next to your spouse apparently that is extra? When our plane arrived we asked if we could change our seat assignment and were told no. Upon boarding we found the plane was half full and those of us who did not pay their extra fees sat in the back rows all split up from our spouses. I realize this is a business and I chose to fly no frills. However, when the company is at fault and they could accommodate a seat change on a delayed flight and place people toward the front to catch their connections why would they not do so? We missed 2 connecting flights because of their poor planning. We have not flown American in years and maybe that was the problem. We will not fly them again. Go Southwest!"
1807,"  After a 24-hour journey home to Toronto from South Africa, the last leg of my trip was on American Airlines out of Chicago. As I settled into my seat, I watched my luggage being loaded on the plane parked next to me. I alerted the flight attendant, who quickly reached out to the supervisor to intervene. After much discussion and delay, I finally saw the baggage handlers walk my suitcase over to the stairs of our gangway. Eureka! I saved myself the extra hassle of recovering my luggage after Qatar so skillfully and autonomously managed several potential baggage issues on the other legs of my trip, or so you would think. Even though I was able to intervene enough to get my suitcase to the door of the plane, it actually never made it inside. Whatever happened at that moment saw my luggage delayed until the next flight, 2 hours later. Not impressed by the 'we-don't-really-care-about-you-or-your-luggage' attitude. Oh yeah, and here's a little bag a mini-pretzels to make up for it. They could learn a lot from international standards."
1808," I have never had a good experience with American Airlines. And I just now had another bad one where I wasted an hour and a half on the phone trying to get a flight reserved. American Airlines is almost always late in my experience and their lateness last July caused us to miss our connecting flight. Just because it was with another airline, also terrible, I had to pay full, walk-in price for tickets because of American Airlines inability to be on time. I complained and got a ridiculous $25 voucher which I can't even use except in the U.S. Why all this penny-pinching when airlines are profiting off us like crazy? And we all know it. The flights are hot and crowded. It's a miserable experience."
1809,  Boston to Harrisburg. Flight was delayed without assigning any reasons. Boarding delayed for 45 mins without any announcement. Took one hour to taxi on the runway for take off. Flight attendant very rude when was requested to let me go to the restroom since the takeoff was delayed by one hour. Kept on yelling and insulting in spite of being told that due to bladder problems I cannot hold urine for long. Extremely rude customer service.
1810, Worst airline ever. Canceled my connecting flight on the way down and now next one is delayed. Also told me that my bag that I fly with every week and had their airline gate ticket on was too big. Then charged me. Then after going out of security to check the bag and coming back to TSA checkpoint my ticket timed out and was invalid.
1811,"  I have flown with Delta multiple times as well as Southwest. First of all, I can almost assure you 95% of the employees there get paid to not care about their jobs. When I arrived 25 mins before boarding time, I had to get a different flight. Employee neglected to let me know there were standby flights available. When I was leaving Nashville, I was 33 minutes before boarding time and was still considered ""late"", this lady only let me know the standby option. Clearly the employees are clueless about their jobs and have no sympathy whatsoever. I've never sat in such a tiny seat, I felt absolutely trapped and terrible on only an hour and a half plane ride. When I got on standby the guy at the podium let me know I was the second name to be called. After several names being called, I was the last one along with two other men. They made me walk all the way to the airplane door just to let me know they had miscounted the seats and were fine with sending me away. As I waited for the next standby flight, the lady took forever and continued to do other things while I was sitting right in front of her. Then said the next standby was at another gate, to get in line for 10 mins and wait for them to announce a gate change. I went to the different gate that they announced just for the employees to look at me because they werent ready for that flight yet. The neglect and ignorance of this company is unreal. Not only did I pay $300+ for some stupid flights with layovers just to pay $75 extra because of an undereducated worker. I've never ridden such a terribly serviced plane."
1812, For everyone who wants to check a bag with American (usually $25) better do it before you get to the gate as the prices doubles as you rush to your flight. Checked one small carry on at the gate for $50. Seriously? Current status: flown 24 times with American in 2017 and was looking forward to getting gold! Not anymore!
1813," Flew to Boston from DFW and back on a nice TWA retro jet in first class. The service was impeccable; great food and drink, good movie library in personal AVOD. Very friendly staff, comfortable seats. Could not ask for a better flight; in my many years of travel this one is definitely at the top. It is nice to see that the golden standard of flying is coming back. Will definitely keep flying American."
1814,"  Phoenix to Atlanta. Today American Airlines gave me the worst travel experience I've ever had. I bought a ""new"" economy tickets, unbeknownst to me. I've flown American Airlines 14 times in last couple of years and trust me American could careless. Their employees were rude and unprofessional. They charged me $50 For a bag fee at the gate even after the supervisor agreed the online check in was confusing. Save your money, fly Delta. AA is no deal with the exorbitant fees and they seem to dislike paying customers."
1815,"  Los Angeles to Phoenix. I purchased the new American Airlines Economy class ticket. Little did I know what that really entailed. I pay $25 for my carry on luggage and head to the gate 2 hours early. My boarding group was Group 9. As they call each group, I walk closer and closer to the gate. At Group 7, they close the gate. I was standing there with 8 other people in Group 9 and the man walks up to us and tells us the gate is closed. They never called last boarding, and never called our group! We were told we were ""late"". We were sent to customer service. As I walked up to customer service, the women closed the rope on me and told me she was off duty and someone else will show up. The Manager arrives and continues to tell me and the 8 other passengers that it was our fault that we were late to the gate and that was why they left without us. Customer service tells me she will place us on standby for the next flight. We get on the bus to the next terminal and race to catch the next flight. When I get there, the person at the desk tells me that I will not be getting on the flight. Customer service sent all of us to another terminal to catch a flight she knew we would never get on! As I try to explain to the man what happened, he shuts me up and tells me there is nothing he can do. I raise my voice out of frustration and he calls the security to tell me to leave the terminal right away. I leave the airport and head to the main check in. I tell them my story and she tells me that she will put me on the next flight in the morning and I will make that flight. I Uber home and wake up at 3AM to catch the 5:30 AM flight. I'm the last to be called for the standby and I start boarding the plan. the women stops me as I'm walking onto the plane and tells me I have to get off and there is no more room. Not even an apology, nothing. Grabs my arm and tells me I have to get off there is no more room. Tells me I have to stand in line and wait to find out if I can get on the next one.  I get told I will not get on the next flight. I ended up renting a car and driving to PHX. When I went to baggage claim, the women was very nice and asked what had happened in LAX with those flights because there seemed to be many other people with my same problem who had to end up driving."
1816,"  Flew American Airlines in MCE from Austin to Las Vegas via Los Angeles. First flight on a new A321, bulkhead. Comfortable seat with plenty of legroom despite a fixed wall in front. Nice video screen with plenty of option to pass on the time on a quick 3 hour flight. Flight attendants this morning were ever present and filled out several drink orders with a smile and some humor. Did not purchase any food, as we had a light breakfast in the Admirals Club before boarding. Flight was comfortable enough and on time, thankfully as we had only a 45 minute connection in LAX. Connection to LAS was on a B738. The gate area was chaotic, however boarding was on time and efficient. 2nd row in MCE had plenty of legroom for he 46 minute flight to LAS. A quick beverage service with only a choice of juice or water was just fine. On time again, with decent service for a very busy short short hop. Overall pleased as usual and good value."
1817,"  Chicago to Indianapolis. There’s a reason American Airlines is not my preferred carrier and today’s experience served to push them much further down the list. Traveling with the same baggage I carried a week earlier on United, American decided that gouging $25 to check a bag wasn’t insult enough; they forced me to check a second bag for an outrageous $35 more. United charged quite enough at $25. American lamely pointed to their 'policy', but it is those very policies that will keep me out of their seats."
1818,"  Los Angeles to Orlando. I have had six flights in a row that have either been delayed or cancelled by American Airlines, and this entire time they never attributed a flying credit I had with them for any of my purchases. When I asked to prolong this credit (which was my own money and then cancelled with a free £200 for them), they refused to even prolong the one year lifespan of my refund. And this all comes after my extended patience with their utterly incompetent services, purchasing tickets for my crew members and all. American Airlines is not only the least reliable large airlines in the United States, they are also the least inconsiderate of their customers. I will never give them another dollar, and neither should you."
1819,"  Durango to Minneapolis via Chicago. This airline is so unprofessional. My first flight got delayed so an agent rebooked me three flights instead of two like I had originally paid for. All of the flights never departed on time making me nearly miss both connecting flights. American Airlines is so untimely. Instead of a seven hour trip home, it became thirteen hours with all the delays. Despite passengers being being seated for a long time. I will never again fly with this airline for how unprofessional and inconsiderate they are to their customers. I paid more for my flights through this airline than I do at cheaper airlines, like Spirit and Southwest. Spirit and Southwest gave me 100% better service. Please spare yourself a waste of time and money by not flying with American Airlines."
1820,"  Auckland to Boston via Los Angeles. There are two options to get from direct from NZ to the US, United or American (Air NZ & QANTAS flights are operated by those airlines too). American were slightly cheaper so I picked them and I was very pleasantly surprised. Check in was a breeze, and the crew were well presented and welcoming. Throughout the flight they were polite, friendly and attentive. Best of all they had personality and  chatted happily with passengers. The food was nice and just the right amount to be full but not bloated. Inflight entertainment selection was really good. Leg room and seat width were fine for me (average height and build). Just take your own headphones as they only give out ear buds. So overall the Auckland to LA flight was excellent value for money and I'd fly American again to get to the US. I had concerns about my short layover in LA, only 2 hours to clear customs and security and get to the Boston flight. I needn't have worried, LAX do it right. They had an Express Connection pass waiting for all passengers connecting within 2 hours which meant I skipped a lot of queues. They had staff at multiple points to direct passengers, so I made it to my next flight an hour after getting off the first one, and had time to grab a coffee. LA to Boston flight was well organised, left on time, the crew were fine and I'd happily do this flight again too. Again, bring your own headphones. The inflight entertainment was available, but they don't give out headphones. Overall I was nicely surprised by American and will use them next time I head to America."
1821,"  San Antonio to Roanoke. Overall, American Airlines continues to disappoint. I really only ever fly with AA as a last resort, and I can’t see any reason to recommend traveling with AA. I was prior active duty Army, and now I’m a reservist, and only American Airlines makes me feel like my service is less important now. United, Southwest, Jet Blue, Delta, every other airline doesn’t discriminate between Active Duty and Reserve/Guardsmen when it comes to bag fees. So, along with uncomfortable, outdated planes and poor service, I spent a $100 checking bags to and from my destination."
1822,"  Dallas to El Paso. The gate agent was rude and condescending. The $50 fee for checking your bags at the gate with an economy ticket is horrible. The price of the ticket isn't cheap enough to charge such expensive fees for baggage. That is especially true when other airlines have better ticket prices, service and cheaper baggage fees. What's going on with American Airlines? They don't care about their customers. The ticket agents and gate agents are rude and don't understand the meaning of customer service. Their review rating is the lowest among other airlines. I'm done with them."
1823,"  I flew with my family from Dallas Fort Worth to Los Angeles with no problems. We check in at the personal check in because we are flying as a family and I have car seats. They took care of us exceptionally well as I asked them to change/arrange seats so my wife could sit with one kid and I could sit with another kid, no problem then we went through security. However on the way back I was directed to the kiosk checking only and I got annoyed because I wanted to check in with a person so we could change our seats. They refused and said I had to use the kiosk no exceptions. They said I had to go upstairs after security at the actual gate. So I went up there and asked them to arrange the seats so each parent could sit with a kid but they said the flight was full and they could not change seats. I told them my departure flight was the same way and they were able to change my seats but the person refused to do so. So I got mad and just left and let it be. I am writing to complain about American Airlines staff at LAX airport and their very unreasonable accommodation for family and kids traveling abroad. DFW seems to accommodate just fine but LAX is not so accommodating. This is just my experience and not representing all passengers. Hopefully they will read this and change their policies."
1824,"  New York JFK to Heathrow. Hadn't flown AA for more than 4 years and took this return instead of BA for better flight timing. What an awful and disappointing business class experience. Lounge at JFK was overcrowded, food abysmal and staff the rudest I have encountered. Hoping that things would improve on the flight, how wrong I was! Seats were worn and quite dirty, service was abrupt and lacking anything of note. Food is served in large portions, but was very bland and the service was so slow. IFE is okay and didn't watch much anyway. BA has gotten a lot worse in recent times, but even they exceed these terrible American Airlines standards."
1825,"  Chicago to Hartford. Made us sit on a 100+ degree plane on the runway for almost 2 hours. The air conditioning was broken. After pulling away from the gate and suffering in this sauna plane for 3 hours they announced that it wouldn’t be fair to make us sit in the hot airplane for the flight. We were told we would have to return to the gate, which took another 45 minutes. The entire flight would have taken 1.5 hours, we spent more than twice that time on the hot airplane! Their reasoning for not taking off was that they didn’t want us to be uncomfortable! We are deplaning now, this story is not yet over. Also, this plane is brand new, but the only update seems to be that they took away more space from each individual passenger. Literally forced to lean forward in this seat"
1826," My 3 children and I were awaiting our last plane home to Phoenix from Los Angeles after visiting South Korea and as we stand to board we see the time of boarding changed from 5:20pm to 10:35pm. When I ask the attendant at the adjacent gate (because their is no attendant at our gate) what is happening she looks it up and says the time was pushed back to 10:35pm. No apologies, no compensation, no regard for the fact that my 83 year old grandmother is stuck waiting at the airport in Phoenix to pick us up. So I'm completely sleep deprived and she is afraid to drive after dark and now I get to drive the hour and a half home from the airport at midnight after traveling over 30 hours without sleep. Their terminals don't even have seats without armrests to stretch out on and try and grab a cat nap. The lack of compassion and customer service from America Airlines is shocking and disappointing to say the least. I will check reviews prior to booking my next flight. Cathy Pacific took excellent care of my family and I from South Korea to Hong Kong and from Hong Kong to LAX., but the customer service went out the window when we transferred into American Airlines hands. I do not recommend anyone fly American Airlines in the future. You're just a ticket number not a customer or consumer to them."
1827,"  Akron to Norfolk via Philadelphia. Unfortunately had to cancel a flight. Went to cancel and request a credit for future travel and was told that on a $500 flight, the cancellation fee would be $200 per ticket or $400 for this flight! 75% of the cost! Most absurd thing I ever heard. Southwest does not do this. Will never give American Airlines another chance. Also purchased, what I thought was their trip cancellation insurance at the time of booking on their site only to find out this is a separate company and basically this coverage only covers specific situations. What a ripoff."
1828,"  Memphis to Las Vegas via Phoenix. Excellent customer service and professional flight attendants. There was a lady sitting in my assigned window seat. When I told her it was my seat, she would not move. I confirmed my seat with flight attendant and she advised the lady that her seat was in the next row and the lady still refused to move. I sat in another seat and explained it was no big deal. The FA said thank you so much and gave me a bag of snacks for my patience and kindness! She handled the situation smoothly and very professional."
1829,"  Miami to Bradley. I will never fly this airline again. I cannot believe how terrible our flight experience has been. They offer nothing in comparison to other airlines (wifi, charging portles, accommodating staff, seat comfort). I had to measure the suitcase that I've been traveling with and carrying on for eight years, five separate times! As I was boarding l had to measure the suitcase again and was forced to check it. No wonder all of these reviews are negative. I wish I read them before I booked!"
1830,  Dallas Ft Worth to Columbus. Worst customer service! I was traveling with 3 kids and had two busters which I wanted to gate check. The person at the check desk said that I need to check both busters and get them back at the baggage claim. I explained to her three times I did not wanted to check those items and retrieve them at the baggage claim. She printed out and put the papers on the busters without me agreeing to it. The other person working at the gate realized what was going on and stepped in and helped the situation. She printed out the correct tags and we were able to check the two busters at the gate and retrieve them as we walked out of the airplane. The first worker did not even apologized for her lack of customer service. Shame on this person and the airline who hires incapable people!
1831,"  Flew American Airlines from Seattle to Boston via New York. Awful experience - 3 hour delay, missed connecting flight, rebooked on a flight 4 hours later. Customer service agent was too busy involving herself in everyone else's issues while she was ""helping"" me that by the time she found a different, earlier flight out of a nearby airport we wouldn't have enough time to make it. Then they booked me in the last boarding group in my flight. There were plenty of open seats in business class - those were never offered. All around horrible experience, I don't ever plan to fly American again."
1832, Terrible first class. No seat infotainment screen. There is only a small ~9” screen 2 seats in front of me. Totally poor for first class in 2017. Food was mediocre at best. Overhead bins are smaller than average. I won’t be flying American again if I can help it.
1833, I had a connecting flight to DC. Plane was to arrive in plenty of time to connect. Flight to D.C. overbooked (I confirmed with customer service). Plane held in Tallahassee. Pilot said we will just sit here for a while. Arrived at gate at exact boarding time ended. Plane left 5 minutes early. Cost me an appointment with my congressman and senator. Lesson is to allow at least one hour between connecting flight to important destinations and connecting customers can be held hostage.
1834,"  Columbus to Chicago. The worst experience I’ve had flying with an airline. The tickets are much more expensive than their competitors (Southwest, etc) and there is less room for seating and less room for carry-ons to be stowed above. The overhead storage space is so limited that I had to check a carry-on I brought, which may cause fragile items to be damaged. When asked about why I would have to check this, the female attendant spoke with an extremely annoyed and sarcastic tone telling me “well that’s too bad, you can take a seat and book another flight”. This is awful practice, and is a mystery to me why a person like this is getting paid to represent a company. I will never fly with American Airlines again, and I suggest anyone considering flying with them abandon that idea. Also, boarding began after the scheduled time as well as take-off."
1835,"  Detroit to New York. This was my first experience and it was not great. American’s online boarding pass links did not work, so I had to get agents to print them at my layover city. My flight home was cancelled and no voucher was offered. When I arrived in Charlotte there was no agent at my gate to help me, so I had to find another agent at another gate. That was after the kiosk computer could not find my flight information. Bad customer service."
1836,"  Boston to Memphis via Chicago. American Airlines are the worst. Delayed flight 5 times in 20-30 minute increments. Had they been honest from the jump I could have made other arrangements. Airline ticket is a contract allowing 2 carry on bags, which AA are now claiming isn't the case on this aircraft though the fine print neglects to mention that. They demanded I part with valuables and check bag to fly. (Literally just got off AA flight that allowed it- standard size carry on). The flight attended looked me in the eye and point blank lied at 9:45, claiming the flight was leaving at 10. "
1837,"  Cancun to Knoxville. American Airlines is one of the worst airlines out there. They overbook and the planes are very much out of date. Our plane in August to St. Thomas looked straight out of 1970 with no in flight entertainment. Still even has ashtrays. How is that for a 4 hour flight? We paid way too much for that type of service! Unfortunately where we live and want to fly to, we have 2 choices which are AA and Delta. From now on, we will try and take Delta. Our last 3 experiences with AA have been lackluster. We were bumped from our return flight we made 7 months in advance with little compensation. They put us up at a hotel and gave us each $20 for dinner, breakfast, and lunch. Breakfast alone was $23 per person plus tax for a buffet so you can imagine how much lunch and dinner was. The hotel AA put us in said AA overbooks and bumps people often! Not to mention the extra money we had to pay for pet sitters and time missed from work coming back over 24 hours late. They made very little apologies. After emailing back and forth, I finally got $200 flight vouchers. But it didn’t come easy. Plus we have to go through Charlotte, NC for connecting flights which is the rudest airport I have ever been in."
1838," From Washington to Chattanooga all the staff except one attendant on the flight was rude. Once there we had three hour delay that no one seemed to know why. We did however get to stand on a bus for 45 minutes while they lied about not having a flight crew, it ended up being the staff that was onboard while we stood on the bus. No more AA flying for me."
1839,"  Denver to Chicago. I this the attendants and CPU yet staff are just as nice as any other airline. I think the problems I encountered are higher up their food chain. Flying Den to Chi, delayed an hour. Two days later, return flight we waited over two hours for a crew member. I've had more delays than on time flight with American, so plan ahead to be comfortable, because you never know if you'll leave on time or have to sit around and wait for them to get their poop in a group!"
1840,  Dallas to San Jose. The ticketing agent was rude. The plane needed maintenance. We sat on the tarmac for over an hour waiting for the mechanic. The majority of the passengers missed connections. The airlines should have maintained the equipment before boarding Passengers. If I could rate this as a zero with no stars I would.
1841,"  Atlanta to Miami. I sit here at gate D25, waiting to board a flight I shouldn’t be on, more frustrated than I’ve ever been with an airline. I’ve had one bad experience after another with American Airlines. I arrive to gate T9 around 5am and immediately go to the check in desk because I’m flying Basic Economy for the first time so I want the gate agents to know that I’m here and would like a seat number for the flight. One rudely responds, “We’ll call your name when we’re ready for that.” I sit down patiently waiting for my name. Finally my name is called, and she asks me if my small duffel bag is the only bag I have? I respond that yes it is. Another agent chimes in that it looks like it it is too big and that I will have to pay for it. I respond that it should fit under my seat, so I put it in the demonstration bin and of course it fits. They tell me they just wanted to see my bags and that I can sit back down and wait for the next instruction. When it comes time for boarding group 9 to board, I wait for my name to be called. (now apparently there are two individuals with my last name, and the other individual is flying standby. But I don’t find this out until later.) they ask the group to walk with them down the runway and wait for a seat number. I ask the agent when I can board since I paid for a ticket, she asks the other agent about me who checks her list and says that “You’re not on my list!” They give up all seats on the flight and I have now missed my flight. We get back to the desk at which point I’ve never had two grown women be so disrespectful to me. They both blamed me for not getting on the flight. Saying the flight had two Individuals with my last name but not once did they call a first name. I now know that neither Individual with my last name made the flight. I need to be compensated for my inconvenience and these two ladies need to be suspended for how rude they were to myself and other passengers I witnessed. They both should be mandated to take customer service training."
1842,"  Dallas to Calgary. Worst service ever. Connection got delayed, missed the next flight, two managers showed up and decided to send me off to Toronto (to get ride of me) instead of Calgary. Their explanation was ""we didnt notice"". After running around so many times, they offered me the next day flight and one night stay at Super 8, they printed off the stuff and just left."
1843,"  I am very disappointed. My flight was delayed due to non weather related issues from Houston to Charlotte (layover) to the extent there flight was cancelled. So I would be stuck in Charlotte. I had to rent a car and drive to Augustaand then drive back to Charlotte to fly home. My flight was again delayed and I had to stay the night (again non weather related). I finally arrive in Houston Monday morning and low and behold my luggage is delayed on another flight! So I'm late for work, I'm out hundreds of dollars, I do not have my luggage and I am beyond upset! I call and they issue a refund of $96.72. What the heck did that cover! Every time I fly American there are issues. Save yourself time and money and fly with anyone else! Also I paid for the wifi service during the flight and I should have known - it didn't work either. The onboard staff was rude and hasty. They cared more about advertising for their credit card and passing out applications then they did the passengers! I might as well have thrown money out of the window! Even a 1 star rating is too much."
1844,"  Atlanta to Dallas Ft Worth. What has happened to American Airlines, as cocky CEO declares ""we will never lose money again"".  At the same time, as a long time customer, service, Advantage profram, dependability and overall satisfaction for me has gone from 90+ to less than 25%.  Solid F, Three of last four, 9 of last 13 flights have been delayed. Statistics tell us thats not bad luck, simply bad maintenance. FF miles are worthless. Customer is at fault and needs to pay a fee at every opportunity. Again, solid F for me."
1845,  Los Angeles to Dallas Ft Worth. It is a real pity to watch one of the old mainline US carriers continue to fall to new lows. The aircraft broke down and needed to be replaced. The flight was the best part of 5 hours late. Inflight service and ground handling was ordinary. Once upon a time America lead the world with customer service. American Airlines staff seemed to be so demotivated that they really have little interest in their customers. The whole lack of a service culture seems to filter through the airline. They just don't care. This happens far too often and they risk long term customers like me moving their business elsewhere.
1846,"  Kona to Los Angeles. Awful boarding process. The speaker called disabled passengers and military personnel. After they called group 1 (my group) myself and my family preceded to the gate scanned in and started to board the plane. A worker asked what seats we were in before we got to the plane and we told them 4. She allowed us to go. Once we got to the plane a worker asked the people in front of us their seats and let them on. Once we approached she never asked us our seats And very nasty told us ""y'all can't board you have to wait"". I said to her the other worker said we could we're seated in row 4. Her face turned red and she said ""oh ok come on board"" the reason for the hold up was because they were boarding a disabled passenger in the main cabin not first class. I was so mad because she didn't treat the people in front of us like that. After we were seated the rest of the ride went smooth."
1847,"  Tampa to Palm Springs via Charlotte / Phoenix. I ordered my ticket through FlightHub, all flights were cancelled and Tampa airport was closed the night before my departure, because of hurricane Irma. I've been trying to reach FlightHub for over three weeks now to get a refund for my flight, but it was impossible to get through to them via phone. Whenever I called, it keep disconnecting me or they pretend on the other side that they can't hear me, and disconnect. I called AA and they were unable to help me, because the reservation was made through FlightHub agency, so FlightHub is who I need to go through. I called FlightHub again, and after 3 weeks I was finally able to connect with them. They kept me on the phone for 3 hours, going back and forth with American Airlines - finally AA announced that my ticket is not eligible for refund! It is close to $500 that they are refusing to refund and I would understand if the circumstances were different, but the cancellation due to natural disaster should be refunded no matter what. Shame on you American Airlines."
1848,"  Dulles to Tulsa via Dallas Ft Worth. I scheduled my flight allowing for a 2 hour layover since Dallas airport is known for delays. My flight from Dulles was delayed 45 minutes due to a circuit board issue. Once we finally arrived at Dallas, we had to wait around 30 minutes on the runway because there was a plane at our terminal. Once we finally got off the plane I had 10 minutes to get to my next flight so the stewardess directed me to an AA desk to get another flight. The desk of 3 American Airlines worker had no one at their gate or desk so the stewardess left me their for the 3 girls to help me. The 3 workers never looked up from their desk, and when I finally got them to acknowledge me they said they couldn’t help me because they were busy preparing for an international flight that left in 5 hours! I asked them to at least see if my flight had done last call. They refused saying “we don’t have all the time in the world to help people that aren’t on this flight”. Again, that flight didn’t leave for 5 hours and there were 3 workers! I finally made it down to my gate and spoke with customer assistance. The 3 workers there were all on their cell phones, which they didn’t put down when I arrived for help. I explain the situation and also told them I was shocked by the lack of customer service I received at the other desk. 2 of the workers giggles and rolled their eyes while on their cell phones. The gentleman helping respond, “there are more customer that missed their flight than just you, those workers have to managed many customer with specific need, this desk has all the time in the world though. I have you on a new flight, have a nice day”. I’m happy the gentleman was more “welcoming” than the other 5 customer service workers but I can honestly say this is the worst airline customer service I have experienced from any airline company. In addition, the delays were extremely annoying when you had planned ahead as to avoid the problem of a missed connection. Unless I have to fly AA again, I will not!"
1849,"  Dallas to Toronto. Booked American Airlines via Expedia. Got to the airport 7 hrs early to see if we could catch an earlier flight. We were expecting a rebooking fee. What we weren't expecting was what we were told. Were told that we had purchased ""economy"" tickets which are their form of competing with the discount airlines so ""perks"" like rescheduling were not included. Other things they told us were ""perks"": check in luggage ($25 extra each), overhead storage (not allowed), 1 carry on or personal item only (to be stored under the seat only), and the seat itself! Yes she actually said the seat is a pen and would be extra! After all that they wouldn't even seat me with my wife. We were close - 15 rows away! Currently waiting to board in 2 hours. I'm expecting them to say that if we want in-flight entertainment it would be extra and then hand me a mirror to watch my hair grow. Awful airline - save yourselves the heartache and exercise any other option. I certainly will in the future."
1850,"  Boston to Lubbock via Dallas Ft Worth. I was at the gate with time to spare. I purposely did not check a bag, because I wouldn't have time to go to baggage claim when I landed. I understand when they just check it below, then hand it to you when you get off, but they fully checked it. I told her I didn't want it checked. She tried to act like she was doing me a favor by not charging me. Additionally, they tried to check it for the wrong city! The lady was extremely rude about it as well."
1851,"  I walked into the Alexandria Airport (Louisiana) about 5:45am, I went to the check in desk, the self check in was out of order. No one was at the checkin desk. I stood there waiting to be checked in about 30 minutes. The time for my flight came and went. A few minutes after my flight time a man finally shows up, I tried to check in and he informed me that I missed my flight and if I wanted on the next one I'd have to pay 75 dollars. Negative experience could have been avoided if this man was doing his job! Also had the self check in been working I could have avoided missing my flight. This is my frist time flying American Airlines and I will not fly with them again!"
1852, I bought 2 tickets to fly with my boyfriend. Both to and from our destination our seats were split up. I called customer service and they told me it's gate seating and 99.9% of the time you get to sit together. Clearly not that percentage when it happened both flights. What is the point of buying tickets together when they don't even seat you together. I will never recommend nor fly American again.
1853,"  Appalling experience from Milan to New York and back. I was unable to print my boarding pass from the website despite being checked in. I was berated at the check-in desk for being late and asked several times why. I was not late and had to wait for the gate to open once I got there using no express line. The flight attendants on the way to New York were nice, but the airplane was just something out of the 90s. No private screen (which is standard for British, United, Lufthansa, Swiss), no way to control the air conditioning (it was freezing cold), the audio from the audio jack was not working well and the seat pocket was a little broken. On the way back, the cabin crew, and particularly one flight attendant, was just so rude I could not believe my ears. I was asked if I wanted to change seats because I was seated close to the restrooms in the back and when I politely declined explaining that I wasn’t feeling very well and wanted to stay close to the restroom I got a ""yeah, whatever!"" as a response while she walked away. And during landing she said to her colleague, thinking we wouldn’t hear I hope, ""I mean, we are landing, wake up people!"". The food was not bad, but was the same for both long haul flights. I will avoid ever flying with American Airlines if I can."
1854,"  Flew Chicago to Syracuse. Another disaster of American Airlines customer service. I get to the terminal 3 hours early and there is an earlier flight to my destination half full. I cannot even go standby due to my 'status' on American. Watched the half full early flight depart and sat 3 hours to get on the original departure. Don't have these issues with Delta, United etc and they go out of their way to accommodate. If American wants me to obtain status, well this just proves why I stick with Delta."
1855,"  Miami to Seattle via Phoenix. They canceled my flight out of Miami which was 55 hours before Irma hit Miami. So when they canceled me and 80% of the rest of their flights at a time when other airlines were scrambling to get people out of harms way, there were no options left. Thousands of people stranded with a category 5 coming. They charged me $745 to change my flight. They booked, canceled, rebooked, canceled, rebooked 4 times. On the day I finally got out of Miami, Wednesday, 3 days after the storm, AA had canceled 81% of their flights.  My flight was not canceled, but it was 3 hours late because there were no attendants. 81% of their flights are canceled and they couldn't have a crew ready for my flight. Never  will I give them my money."
1856,"  Orlando to San Francisco. I booked my flight through a 3rd party (justfly.com), and I selected my flight as Direct. When I go to the airport and do the whole process to go to the gate I found out that I had to do a stop over in Charlotte. I took the flight because I was an emergency, but I decided to called the next day. When I called to ask, why the have discrepancies in their website, no body was available to help me. I decided to call AA customer service to claim because even my confirmation letter says that I had to do a stop and also change planes. My intention at this point is not to ask for a refund or nothing, just to let them know the discrepancies in a website. As a customer the minimum I deserve is that my questions can be answered with courtesy and respect. "
1857,  Booked on 6:30 am flight to Ronald Reagan airport to leave from gate A8 in Cincinnati. Sent to gate A6 until boarding time 6am. Then sent back to A8 and at 7:02am the flight shows up on gate sign as on time. Flight is actually a half hour late and counting. Every time I fly American out of Cincinnati Northern KY airport the American employees distinguish themselves as incompetent and uncaring people. No credible information is shared with paying customers. I've been lied too on more than one occasion. The American airline personnel do not know the value of good honest customer service.
1858,"  I had heard terrible press about American Airlines - I am so disappointed to find it's all true. Despite booking 5 months ago, I was put on standby due to overbooking for my flight from Santiago to Dallas then Hong Kong. Passengers from a flight to Miami, cancelled only that day, were given seats ahead of me! After a harrowing 3 hour wait, I was given one of the last seats just as the plane commenced boarding. Check in staff were very very slow. Not sure what the problem was but it took an hour for me to reach the front of a 10 person queue with 3 counters open. Onboard staff were also quite rude - they appear to hate their jobs and certainly the passengers! Abrupt, unresponsive. All very different to the cheerful, brand-proud messages in the recorded safety briefing, about how great AA is! I won't fly with them again. Just not worth the stress of not knowing if you'll actually fly with them, despite a paid booking."
1859, I purchased a round trip Charlotte to Harrisburg and going and coming flights were delayed. Right now I'm sitting in the airplane back in Charlotte because they can't find a gate. We have been here for 20 minutes now. Do not fly American Airlines if you can help it. Update I have now been in here waiting for 35 Minutes.
1860," As usual the flight is delayed. It has been four hours so far. The attendents making the announcements scavenged all of the drinks and snacks that were put out for the passengers on the delayed flight. The attendents working the counter also were extremely rude. Some of the passengers were making statements of frustration and the attendents were actually yelling back saying it's not their fault and we all should just quit complaining. Unbelievable! Instead of appreciating our business and apologising for the inconvinience of being delayed (once again, this is my 17th delayed flight in the last few months) the employees got defensive, rude and disruptive. Instead of American being empathetic and compensating passengers with miles, they are rude and unappreciative of their customer base. Not happy with this airline at all."
1861,"  My wife and I were delayed in the Jacksonhole runway because the airline was running late with de-icing solution. This caused us to only have 30 minutes to catch our connection in Dallas. We ran across the Dallas airport and made it in time to see our plane and have another passenger who made it to the gate after us to be let on board. American told us that the system would not let us in but they let the other passenger on board because he had others in his party on board. We also had two in our party that made it on the plane 1 minute before us but they paid no attention to that detail for us. I have over 50,000 miles with American and don't think I can ever fly with them again after being treated this way. Customer service reps are a bunch of robots and totally insensitive to their customers needs."
1862,"  Seattle to Quito via Dallas. For about a year, we planned a trip to the Galapagos and Machu Picchu, and bought round trip airline tickets on American Airlines. The night before our flight (flight departing morning of 8/5/17), we printed boarding passes. At approximately 10PM we received a non-urgent email from American stating: please call to rebook your flight. No other info given. We almost overlooked the email because of the lack of urgency and the fact that we already had our boarding passes. When we called we were informed our entire trip to Equador was cancelled due to ground conditions. I called both airports we would be landing at and they reported no delays or ground conditions. American Airlines would not tell us what the ground conditions were. The night they cancelled, American Airlines only offered to move us to a flight on American leaving 48 hours later which would not get us to our destination for 4 days. (Our original flight would get us there in just over 24 hours.) They would not put us on a flight with another airline, which were available. They did not apologize and treated us like we were wasting there time. We were told we would not be given any compensation for the loss of 4 days of our trip. I called other airlines myself, in the middle of the night, and booked us on Delta (for flights that would get us to our destination on time,) but had to pay $4500 out of pocket. Delta got us to our destination on time and with no ground condition delays. We landed at the same time our original flight was scheduled to land. Upon return from our trip, we tried to contact customer relations at American to get a refund. There was no phone number, so we wrote an email and waited for a call. A day later, a representative notified us we would be getting no compensation for our losses. She gave a cursory ""I apologize for your inconvenience"" She gave us no further support and would not transfer us to a superior. She actually rose her voice with us when we asked to speak to someone else and said she had the authority to make these decisions. There are no phone numbers for customer service, refunds, or managers. Approximately 1 month after our cancelled flight, we finally received a refund of $1680 for the cost of the flight that was cancelled, but we were not compensated for the $4500 we lost. We felt that each person we talked to was unhelpful and even rude at times. We understand that flights can get cancelled but expect to be helped onto another flight in a timely manner or compensated for our losses. At the very least we should have an explanation of why our trip was cancelled. American did none of these and we will never fly with them again"
1863,"  Austin to El Paso via Dallas. My bag was lost when I arrived to El Paso, TX at 12pm. My bag was not delivered until past 7pm. I wasted all evening waiting for my bag and had to cancel plans that I was not able to reschedule. When checking in my bag, a group of four ladies chatted away while several people waited in line. A woman then made a smart comment about using the qiosk to check in our bags. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the qiosks are meant for busy times. There were enough staff members to help those who were in line but they appeared to be too busy to do their job. Needless to say, I will stick to using Southwest Airlines in the future whom I've never had issues with."
1864,"  St Louis to Aruba via Miami. I will never fly with American Airlines again. I received an email two days prior to my flight back home that my flight was cancelled. I called the airline to see if they can get me on another flight as I needed to get home. They had plenty of flights going out of Aruba the following two days but insisted on getting me on a flight that was 5 days later. The agent I spoke to was not helpful what so ever. I explained to her that the other airlines were still operating and asked if they could take care of my ticket with another airline, that was denied. At one point the supervisor got on the line and said to me ""I am not sure why you are wasting your time talking to us when you could be booking a ticket with another airline."" If all flights were cancelled I would have understood, but only mine was. Which really frustrated me, if you cannot fly into that specific airport, reroute the flight and fly into one that you can. Simple. The supervisor got very rude and asked me if I had the ability to make the airplane magically appear. I mean I could go on forever about the awful customer service I received from American Airlines. "
1865,"  Dallas to Savannah. American cancelled our flight during a mandatory evacuation during hurricane Irma. Which left us completely stranded. They rescheduled it for the day the hurricane was supposed to hit this area, which makes no sense. Even if there hadn't been a hurricane, this would have been bad news because they changed the flight from a Sunday to a Monday. I scheduled a Sunday return flight because I work on Mondays, like most people. I called their customer service and they were no help. Luckily Southwest stepped in and was able to book us a flight out of harm's way. It blows my mind that they would do that."
1866,"  Minneapolis to Fayetteville via Charlotte. Before catching the flight in Charlotte, in the last moment they have informed that the flight has been downgraded and 3 people doesn't have enough space. They didn't check for the priority. I am not sure on what basis they have stopped the 3 travelers out of all economy travelers. All 3 were Indians. They were not ready to arrange any other flight. The only flight which is available in AA is next day morning. They said they will arrange accommodation. But they have given a single room for all 3 of us. When i checked with manager to give separate rooms, he said it will be provided in the hotel. But when we reached there it was only 1 single double room and of us had to sleep on the floor. This is the very worst case I have ever seen with the airlines. They should consider the priorities before taking decisions. I would suggest not to take this airline. "
1867,"  Raleigh Durham to Grand Junction via Dallas Ft Worth. Had a delayed flight out of Raleigh Durham into DFW which caused me to miss a connection. I understand it happens. American Airlines refused any extra service for the extended layover. I asked to use the Admirals club in DFW but was denied. Disappointed with lack of accommodation. Delays are routine, bad attitudes from gate agents are standard with American Airlines"
1868,"  Avoid American Airlines at all cost. They could not care less about their customers. I spent 17 hours at different airports all do to with American Airlines problems. Starting my flights in Salisbury, MD. Supposed to have a connection in Charlotte, then on to Fort Lauderdale. The first flight being overbooked. Thinking I was helping out the airline, I accepted a 300 dollar voucher and rebooked on a flight that should have gotten me into Fort Lauderdale earlier than my original flight. Now the fun starts, arriving at the first airport at 5am and finally getting to my destination 17 hours later. The first flight of the day was overbooked. The 2nd flight was delayed due to mechanical problems causing me to miss my connection because of the delayed flight. Since I missed my connection American Airlines tried to find another flight for me, the next flight they offered was almost 10 hours hanging out in the Philadelphia airport before taking off. Then they found a different flight leaving about 3 hours later with another connection in Charlotte. When we arrived in Charlotte, the American Airlines gate area was a total mad house. People standing everywhere up against each other and people sitting on the floor, because of American Airlines problems. It felt like there was no air conditioning, because of all the people in a small area. They were all talking on the microphones at the same time, mentioning delays and offering 900 dollars or more for giving up flights. Now the connecting flight in Charlotte then was delayed several times. Because of all the problems with American Airlines, I missed a lunch and dinner. Also a friend had to rent a 2nd car, because I was the one with the car rental for the trip. Once I got home a few days later I contacted American Airlines and explained the situation, and to let them know I was not pleased. Of course I get a company generated form letter, not even mentioning my complaint, just stating policies. This company could care less about their customers and how they treat them. Being such a large company, they should be more concerned about customer relations. Also looking at this site with reviews, I am not the only person who will not use or recommend American Airlines."
1869,"  San Francisco to Charlotte via Grand Rapids. I started my day off by a missed flight. I guess I have not flown American in a long time. Most airlines put you on the next available flight when you miss a flight. American they put you on stand by for each leg of your flight. Or charge you $200 to reconfirm plus a $200 up charge. I was at SFO for 16 hours I had to pay $75 to grab another flight even though I paid $950 for 2 one-way flights just 24 hours prior. American customer service team members were the worst, they must train them to have a blank face and not care at all. The counter reps in SFO all could care less about helping at all. The reps I spoke with at the gate were too busy to care. I am not a fan of this airline. Basically is took 24 plus hours to get to somewhere that other airlines can get done in 6 hours and have a smile."
1870,"  Atlanta to Philadelphia. They told us they had a problem in the system, so we would have to wait a little - which I didn't have a problem with. Then they went on and on and kept on delaying the expected departure time. And after 2 whole hours of sitting on the plane, they told us we would have to go outside in the boarding area and wait. At this point I was a little annoyed, but not mad. After that, they made us wait 3 more hours outside in the boarding area, with little to no help from the staff on when we were going to leave, before they told us the whole flight had been cancelled. I was going to miss a whole day of seminars that I had to attend. Then I was like its okay, mistakes happen, and then rebooked the flight for the next morning at 6AM since they had no more available flights on that day.  I got back home at around 2, so I had been there for about 8 hours.  The next day I was on my way to the airport when I got a text message that my 6AM flight had been cancelled too. At this point I was furious. It was not even a weather related issue, it was because of American Airline's lack of preperation ahead of a flight, in which they always seem to have problems with their system. I had to call their customer service an try to rebook, since I had to get to Philly as soon as I could. The staff on the phone were horrible, first they said there were no more flights availble on that day to philly, (In which there were because I could literally see that there were available flights - I was looking at it on my phone when I was talking to them). Then I asked them if they could switch me to another airline, in which they said that it was not possible. I hung up the call out of frustration, and called them back a few minutes later, this time someone else picked up. I asked him the same question I asked the other guy, that if they could switch me to another airline. This time, the answer was different. He said he could switch me over to united. I was shocked, because the other guy told me they could not do that. The united flight was later in that day, so by then the program I was going to attend in Philly would be over, so I decided to ask for a refund. I had to scream at the guy to let me get a refund because he was refusing to give it to me for ""privacy"" purposes, which didn't make sense at all. Even after all that I went through, I could not understand how someone could not give someone their money back. After about an hour of yelling and convincing, he finally gave me a refund.  I do not recommend this airline to anyone, there are better options out there and I think you would save yourselves a lot of time and money by avoiding American Airlines."
1871,  Atlanta to Detroit via Charlotte. My flight was delayed in Atlanta and started at 7:30pm and my connection was missed in Charlotte at 8pm. When I requested customer service they allocated me for 10:30pm flight and the last minute they said pilot was unavailable so flight delayed to 2am. At 1:30am aa representative came told that flight was cancelled.. and they are very rude and helpful when I asked for the reason. And next day they have asked me to come to airport by 8 so that they can allocate me on 9:30AM flight. When I came to airport they said flight was full they can't accommodate.. they said they will allocate me 12:30 pm flight it was also delayed till 3pm because of unavailability of pilots. And they were unable to allocate a seat in that flight also.. when I asked for the reason they said your name was not showed up and their behavior is very rude. This is my second time travel in American Airlines and two times faced the same issue. These people don't understand the situation. This might be my last travel in American Airlines and I won't recommend this airline to anyone.
1872,"  London Heathrow to New York JFK. Boarding was OK. Was feeling a little thirsty before take off and asked one of the cabin crew members for water. It was the most unpleasant exchange I have had with an airline staff. The conversation went: Me: excuse me, can I have a glass of water please? Airline staff (male): what's that? He asked the question in a very rude manner and looked visibly annoyed that I was asking him something. I would have expected something along the lines of: ""I'm sorry mam, I did not hear you."" In any case, I repeated my question. Me: Can I have a glass of water please? Airline staff: Well we're about to take off so I can't. I did not catch the rest of his answer because as he started responding he simply turned around and continued talking as if he wasn't talking to me - all this in a very rude and angry tone. I thought to myself I'm only asking for a glass of water and if indeed it is not possible now, the correct and polite answer would have been: ""I'm sorry mam, but unfortunately we are about to take off so it is not possible right now. We'll bring you a glass after take off."" For someone who travels quite a lot with major airlines and have platinum level with some airline mileage programmes, I was quite shocked because this is really the lowest in terms of the quality of in-flight personnel. I fly American Airlines  rarely but think I will just cross it off my list of respectable airlines. Would absolutely not recommend it. "
1873,"  Boston to Philadelphia. Delayed Flights. I fly instead of taking the bus so that I can save time and cut the long traveling time. And that's why I am even ready to spend more dollars. But American Airlines flights are always delayed for more than an hour. And it happened to me not just once but 4 or 5 times. Once, my flight was delayed by 5 hours. Typically it is a 45min. flight from Boston to Philadelphia. And the bus takes about 7 hours. But when I fly with American Airlines, the travel time is almost similar to a bus journey. They always have maintainance issue with their flights and I always end up spending 1-2 hours in the airport or flight, waiting for it to take off. And they never compensate for this delay in anyway. I am completely disappointed with American Airlines."
1874,"  Miami to Cancun. Very disappointed at the airline. Not family oriented. Traveled with my wife and three kids 3, 4, 7 and they gave us separate seats. After talking to a lady at the gate they where able to seat my wife with two of my kids. However my 4 year old was seated by himself with two other people that he did not know. Finally we have to seat our 3, 4 and 7 years old by themselves. I can't comprehend how American Airlines think within their standards this is safe and not a liability. What would happen in case of an emergency? How can I protect my kids if something would happen?"
1875,"  Norfolk to Dayton via Washington. I was flying with my 90 year old grandmother who has limited mobility. Our first flight was delayed about 30 minutes in Norfolk so it was a rush to catch our connecting flight. I was very worried we would miss our next flight with my grandmother being in a wheel chair. American Airlines was very helpful to accommodate us. They brought us our own handicap-accessible bus, took us right to our gate and wheeled us straight onto the next plane. We made it with time to spare! The pilot saw how exhausted my elderly grandma looked, and upgraded us to first class. He made our whole day! Thank you American Airlines!"
1876,"  Flight from Los Angeles delayed. Anticipated agents with a sense of urgency when we got off directing us. Would have been nice if a better job was done getting us off the plane ahead of other passengers. Fortunately, we made the connection. People had moved around. I had someone in my seat. Someone else mentioned others had moved around. Just find a seat. This caused a problem for the one attendant. The male attendant laughed, threw his hands up and commented, 'ain't my problem', and then began to gossip with one of the other flight attendants about the one taking roll call. Please be a team and be professional. Now a maintenance issue. Hope to be on my way soon."
1877,"  Please don't fly with American Airlines. They will hold you on the runway for 31 minutes from an international flight, knowing what you have to do to get to your connecting flight. Then when you arrive at your terminal 9 minutes before your flight leaves they will not let you board cause the door is closed and they can't just reopen it. Yet the plane is still sitting at the terminal. Not to mention this is the last flight out of this terminal and the last one coming in. I know as I stayed there till 1am trying to get my problem solved with them. No one in customer services actually knows what that is at Dallas Fort Worth airport. Rude and care nothing about their customers. The best part is when we got to customer service they had three people working. When a line started up 2 of those 3 people just left. Leaving one person to deal with everything. Then when you ask to speak to a manager. They make you wait an hour until a flight attendant shows you were they are one gate over. As you stand there waiting to speak with them. They act like you are not even there. Typing away on the computer until you do something to really get the attention of them. Then they say well you can fly out tomorrow at 7.30 but we can do nothing else. So you call a 800 number and they tell you how they should pay for your hotel, food for the night/breakfast and get you to and from the airport/hotel and back. So I missed a 8.20pm flight and finally got to a hotel at 12.45am. Best part was we had 8 other people in the same boat. 2 from my flight and the rest were different flights. Come on AA horrible customer service and communication. Never will I waste my money with this airline."
1878,"  Cozumel to Denver via Dallas. Our gate was changed three times. Our flight was delayed 2 hrs, then 2.5 hrs, now 3 hrs. They officially decomissioned our plane due to mechanical issues. Dont know when or if we are going home tonight or tomorrow.  Complete, total failure. Does this flight even exist? As of 2 seconds ago, yet another gate change but crew and fictitious plane will not be ready for another 20 minutes. Thank you for ruining my Sunday and extending my travel time to 24 hrs.  Will never fly it again even if it is the cheapest. You get what you pay for! Spend your money elsewhere!"
1879,"  The last time I have flown American Airlines was in 1994, it will take a lot longer to wipe out this horrible memory, I was flying American to connect with a Qatar Airways flight to Doha. It was an early morning flight 06.55 so we checked in at 4 am, the horrible American Airlines check in staff refused to issue the connecting flight Qatar Airways boarding pass, even though it was one ticket and both are part of One World, he even lied and claimed falsely that Qatar Airways have withdrawn from One World. Boarding was smooth and the whole way to New York I was trying to be nice to the cabin attendants and smiling to them and all they had was a straight face!"
1880,"  Atlanta to St. Thomas via Miami. Terrible. Flight delayed from Miami thus we missed our ferry from St. Thomas to Tortola. Staff at desk were not only useless but nasty as well. Would not give us details or assistance beyond telling us the St. Thomas staff will help. We get there, the staff is even worse. Now on the return leg of our trip same story. Flight is delayed thus we're missing our connection. No help, apologies or anything besides ""you're stuck. Will never fly them again. If I could give a zero rating I would."
1881,"  Flew Miami to Maui via Phoenix. American Airlines is the worst airline I have ever flown. Even though flying first class, the gate agent charged me for bags. I complained at the time but was told that is the way it's going to be. The gate agent then sent my bag to a different country leaving me with no clothing, toiletries, etc. Even a day later the airline was unable to confirm the location of my bag or make any commitments regarding getting the bag to me. I had travelled to Maui for my son's wedding. On top of all of this, on two long-haul flights to Maui from Miami, the airplanes had no entertainment and shoddy Internet. To the extent humanly possible, I will never fly American Airlines again."
1882,"  Phoenix to Reno. The worst service ever! After checking in at the counter and handing my ID to the clerk, I was given someone else's ticket along with my sons ticket. I didn't notice till I was going through security. I was told I couldn't go through because my ID didn't match my ticket. I was in tears. I had waited 42 minutes in line and did not have time to go back to the ticket counter 2 floors down without missing my flight. I was escorted by some airport staff and they asked the counter person to make sure to call and let them know I was coming and hold my seat. I got there 15 min till departure time and was told my seats were given away to stand by and they were overbooked! I was in tears with my son. This was the last flight back home and all other flights from other airlines were sold out. They said there was nothing they could do for me even though it was their fault for giving me someone else's ticket and causing me to lose my seat. Customer service just gave me number to call. I have never experienced this kind of unprofessionalism. I would never recommend this airline to anyone."
1883,  Flew from New Orleans to Cancun. A travel warning was issued to our place of destination after booking the flight. Other members of our group are flying with Delta and I regret not doing so. Everyone was able to change their ticket as Delta was understanding of the circumstances. I was not given that option and could not even escalate the call to speak to someone for assistance. The customer service I received was useless and the lack of concern for safety is completely unacceptable. Never using American Airlines again.
1884,  Flew Charlotte NC to Fayetteville NC. Trash. I fly American all the time due to contracting with the company I work for. I can not stand them. Always late. Airplains are always delayed. I have a flight canceled on me 30min befor it boarded. I ended up having to drive over an hour to the next airport to make the flight they transferred me to without offering me a refund or if it was possible for me to make it that far. Every time I fly I with American I know I am flying the absolute bottom of the barrel. Oh and they live to charge like they are something special. $1000+ for a round trip on the east coast? Wish I was back with Southwest. 
1885,"  Just a quick review, since I think so many people only ""review"" when they've had a bad experience. I flew Portland OR - Boston RT and had a terrific experience. Nothing remarkable but online ticketing and check-in was easy, everyone was friendly, got the seats I wanted, no hitches, delays etc. Great experience overall from American Airlines."
1886,"  We are happy to report an excellent experience with American Airlines. We took a long-anticipated vacation to D.C. and the flight there was on time and very nice to inexperienced travelers. The flight was good and we were comfortable. They handed out snacks and a drink to passengers. Unfortunately, our trip was cut short due to an unexpected death in the family. My mom had also been hospitalized after learning of the death, so I just wanted to get home asap. I called American Airlines to help change our plans for an emergency flight home, and the woman who helped us was so kind and patient as we were still reeling from the news and trying to make a decision whether to take an early flight with a layover or take one in the afternoon. They waived change fees that would have been over $400 and just charged us less than $20 for the difference in the ticket costs. The woman from American Airlines handled everything, and got us home at the earliest possible time we could get out. We are inexperienced fliers and have never had a transfer. The ticket agents helped us figure everything out. When our flight was delayed due to weather I started to panic for fear of missing out connecting flight, and the steward was so helpful and kind - The transfer ended up getting off and then getting back on the same plane so we didn't have to worry about missing the connecting plane! Thank you American Airlines - we felt like people, never like sheep. "
1887,"  Fort Lauderdale to Washington. The flight was delayed by almost an hour, and once they called us from the terminal they had not even gotten other flight out of the airplane and had us standing in line for 15 minutes. On the plane, they claimed to never have picked up their free snacks from their last stop, so all they have is ones you have to pay for. The wifi was unavailable for our flight. Once we landed (late from our estimated arrival time) we were waiting in line to get to the terminal for about 15 minutes for the so called ""wing men"" or something like that to help get the plane there safely, and now we have been waiting in the plane for apparently a designated person who can operate the ramp so that we can get off this flight from hell. We are currently still waiting. I do not plan on using this airline again."
1888,"  My return journey from Orlando to London via Chicago was a journey from hell and very disappointing experience. I wasn't even notified of my delayed flight from Orlando and I was re-routed via Dallas Ft Worth instead. I urged the agent to book me on the direct flight to London on British Airways but she refused saying it was full. I later found out that that wasn't true and there was plenty of seats available at the gate. Flight to DFW was also delayed which meant I missed my connection in DFW. I was stuck there for a whole day, and missed a day at work. No accommodation was offered. The flight from DFW to LHR was depressing. They ran out of meals so was served a sandwich instead. I was told I need to pre-order next time! I explained that I was re-routed and had no choice. To top it up, my bags were delayed too. Everything that can possibly go wrong went wrong. I don't think I ever had an on time departure with American Airlines. Very depressing"
1889," Absolutely the worst communication from American Airlines. Rude staff, flight from Philadelphia to Seattle got delayed 9 hours with yet again no communication to the guests. I will drive to the rest of my vacations due to the experience we received. This is unacceptable. 2 thumbs down will not recommend this flight to anyone, friends or family"
1890,"  Denver to Sioux Falls. Not only are chances likely that you'll have a delay (4 of my last 4 flights with them), passengers weren't notified of the delay until after we boarded this morning and 15 minutes into boarding for the second flight. I have literally been sitting at the airport for 12 hours because of a missed connection that I could have left the airport and driven 9 hours to my destination. Had I been notified ahead of time of these delays, I could have driven across the Midwest to get to my destination and not missed the prayer service for my uncle who passed away. Based on my last four experiences, they have surpassed Frontier from an unreliable standpoint. I will never fly with them again."
1891,"  This was a very frustrating experience. There was a delay of three hours in Charlotte. There were four delays (and reschedulings) in all. There was very little explanation given for the delays. For the second delay, the passengers had actually completely boarded, and then we were told to disembark. When we finally got on the plane - three hours late, the pilot gave a very brief (and disingenuous) apology and then said, ""Well, it is what it is."" The rest of the flight staff never apologized, nor did anyone at any time offer anything in the way of a perk (food, beverage, etc.) or mention anything about any compensation for passengers. This is the very last time I fly American. "
1892,  San Juan to Miami. I have never been so disappointed with an airline. I am actually sitting and waiting to be boarded on a standby flight. I checked in 1 minute after the one hour mark was told that nothing could be done. I am here with 5 other families including my own that all arrived here at the same time. Even families with no luggage were not permitted to board. I watched them give my ticket away to people in standby once I got to the gate. This is ridiculous.
1893,"  I am extremely disappointed with the service I received at American Airlines I travel quite a lot with American Airlines accruing miles through their AAdvantage program. For the first time I decided to finally use my miles towards a car rental. I went ahead and applied 28,800 miles for a 6 day rental in Mallorca (paid in full). When I came to pick up the car at the PMI airport, the teller did not recognize the voucher and prompted me to provide my credit card. At first I thought it was only for incidentals but at the end of my trip, they charged my card in full ($274). I only realized this after I arrived back home. I contacted American Airlines and informed them of the issue. They acknowledged that Avis (the rental car company) made a mistake and that they would facilitate a refund of my miles. After a few days passing, I did not hear back from American Airlines nor did I see the miles credit back on my AAdvantage account. I followed-up with American Airlines. A representative responded to my inquiry and informed me that there is nothing they can do. I repeatedly inquired to escalate this issue to the supervisor. He claimed he was a supervisor and said there was nothing they can do. In short, I spent 28,800 and $274 for a mini-car for 6 days. Is this fair? I think not. American Airlines failed me and I don't plan to use their airline ever again."
1894,"  Myrtle Beach to Baltimore Washington via Charlotte. Daughter arrived at Charlotte gate E22 to connect to a flight to BWI. She was escorted to gate E24 and was told her flight to BWI would be departing from E24. She notified me via text that she was at gate E24. The AA flight status information on the app, website, and airport monitor noted flight AA2018 to BWI was departing from gate C10. She was left at the wrong gate. With less than 20 minutes to get to the correct gate and make flight AA2018, I called her and instructed her to speak to an AA rep at the counter that AA flight status information noted gate C10 and ask why she was at gate E24. AA reps then rushed my daughter to the correct gate. AA was paid an unaccompanied minor fee, however my daughter would have missed the flight had it not been for parental intervention to get her to the correct gate. I sent a letter to the VP of AA requesting a refund of unaccompanied minor fee. I received a response denying the refund stating ""she was still properly escorted for the entirety of her travel while on board and in the airports."" They also let me know they were logging this into their 'sophisticated database"" so leaders can review it. I addition, to make the reservation one has to call AA. The AA rep on the 1-800 stated they would waive the fee. However, when I checked her in the AA rep at the airport stated there would be an additional charge. I explained that the 1-800 folks waived the fee; the airport agent charged me regardless and even pulled out the AA policies to show me. There was definitely a communications/knowledge gap in process. I should have been told upfront or a note placed on the file that it was waived. Had I known I would have had to pay the fee, I would not have booked the flight (the fee was 50% more than the one way flight)."
1895,"  I had a flight scheduled for Sept 5th 2017 from New York to Pittsburgh with a layover in Boston, to go surprise my mother for her birthday. I booked this flight through Justfly.com in April. My mother passed away in early August a month before her birthday, which was the whole meaning behind me taking the flight to Pittsburgh. I contacted justfly.com and American Airlines informing them of the situation and that I was not going to be making that flight. Not only was it a very long process to even speak to someone about the situation, but that they could not refund the flight and could only give me flight credit if I gave them a copy of my mothers death certificate and proof that she was my mother (I was advised against giving that those are personal documents that would not be asked for prior to booking a flight). I would rather pay double the price with a different airline and website than fly with with American Airlines again. "
1896,"  American Airlines is using a very old plane for this route from Miami to Milan. There are no individual screens for in-flight entertainment which is very unusual for such a long flight. Also the dinner and breakfast served is of poor quality but in line what you pay for flying with American Airlines. However, the flight was on-time and the flight attendants were friendly."
1897,"  Flew Philadelphia to Montego Bay, Jamaica. American Airlines deliberately delayed our flight in order to accommodate a connecting flight coming from another state so they only had to provide one trip but thereby inconveniencing all travelers they willing delayed which ruined our first day of our vacation and honeymoon. The airline was not forthright about its decision and we were given two different reasons which both proved to be untrue. I attempted to contact AA directly and was basically told in several email responses that we eventually got you there so get over it! I will never fly AA again and warn all who consider using them to do your research and look for better options. Not user friendly at all."
1898,"  What a terrible experience on American Airlines. First we have a 4 hour delay in Charleston, because apparently the air conditioning on the plane wasn't working. Then after 2 hours trying to fix it they finally assign another plane to come pick us up in Charleston from Charlotte, NC. This delay causes us to miss our connecting flight and bumps our departure to tomorrow morning (or so we thought). Upon arrival in Charlotte, we find out that our flight to Des Moines was delayed too allowing us to make the flight however it was too late, they sold our seats and we couldn't get on the flight despite being on that flight to begin with. This experience caused me to miss a critical business meeting. I've had nothing but poor experiences with American and it's frustrating to yet again be stuck in a connecting city when it turns out I was on time for the flight anyhow. Thanks for selling the seat that was mine and bumping me to the following day. Come to find out while mingling with a frequent traveler departing Charleston, this is a regular occurrence and this plane frequently has mechanical delays. Take the time to service your equipment. We all have families to get home to, busienss to tend to and we all pay a pretty penny to fly with you. It's clear my money is better spent with a competing airline."
1899,"  Seattle to Chicago. This is the worst flight I can recall in decades of flying American and other airlines, and I was flying in First Class. The plane was old, the toilet was not kept clean during the flight. The female flight attendant sat strapped in and facing us mid-flight and ate, after which we were given nothing. We arrived at 5:55am without being offered juice or coffee prior to landing. We were to be given ""snacks"" plural but got only one snack serving at the start of the flight and nothing during the rest of the time. We had no brewed coffee available. The flight attendants' uniforms looked as though they had slept in when we boarded the plane. This was the most class-less First Class. The air quality was also poor. There was a strange smell when we got on, and it did not dissipate. You could choose to close air vents or endure cold air blasting down on your head. The equipment should be replaced and so should the crew. The seats are hard and barely recline.  We were on time and had a safe flight. That's all that matters in the end, but choice of airlines is competitive."
1900,"  San Francisco to New York JFK. More often than none, passengers bash the airline that failed to meet their personal expectations. There are so many components that go into air travel that it becomes trite to focus on event that left a bad taste. So, this review is to extol American Airlines. Checking in at SFO was quick and easy and the women who placed the luggage on the belt was charming. The Admirals Club was staffed by friendly workers and the morning display of food was more than enough to satisfy even a picky traveler. The Aircraft is amazing as is the business class seats. The FAs were professional, warm, friendly, and proud to be serving the customer. The food was as good as the service. IFE was outstanding. This was one of the best flights I have taken. American is doing what they do best. Perhaps it is the route that warrants this service. "
1901,"  Fayetteville to San Diego via Charlotte. First got a call saying my second flight to San Diego was overbooked then got to the airport to find out the aircraft was downgraded for my first flight so they had to cut 15 people. Then the first flight was delayed for an hour. Not to mention my wife got a call for her flight at 1000 pm the night before saying her flight to a different location was totally cancelled, I have never had a good experience with them only use them rarely when my business makes me use them."
1902,"  Always switching gates, sometimes even terminals. Arrived at gate as stated on ticket at boarding time and sat down to wait. Then I heard them say flight to Tuscan had changed gates. My flight was to Portland, which had obviously been changed earlier. After slow, seemingly uninterested service I was told my flight had moved 20 gates to the other end of terminal. I ran and literally arrived 2 min after door closed. Lady made no real effort to get me on the plane. Just cited the rules. Meanwhile I could see plane sitting there. Clearly could have helped if she tried. Service on flights and at gates always seems plastic and fake, like they are just going thru motions and not even trying to hide it. No regard for the customer. I will never fly American Airlines again!"
1903,"  Flew American Airlines from Ontario to Phoenix. I had to call the customer service for a question about baggage and upgrade. I would like to say how impressed I was with their customer service. Upon completing a short voice prompt, I was directed to the appropriate department. I expected a wait time as with most lines. I was pleasantly surprised to be connected to a customer service representative in under a minute. When I talked to her, she was most gracious and helpful."
1904,"  Boston to La Guardia. At boarding gate, suddenly American Airlines announced the flight is delayed from 12.00 to 2pm without any prior notice at check in or earlier. I booked for first class but then got downgrade if I want to go earlier flight at 1 pm. I have no choice and they told me there won't be any compensation. Only 1 staff working at the gate trying to fix this problem for the whole plane passenger. Very bad management and unacceptable problem solving."
1905,"  Los Angeles to Shanghai PVG. I just encountered the absolute worst check-in and security I have ever experienced. We were at the American Airlines terminal at LAX. They insisted we checked in using machines, none of which worked for us.  When we went to a desk the lady behind the encounter was rude and accused us of using the machines incorrectly.  We were given seats not next to each other for our 13.5 hour flight. When we asked if we could sit next to each other the woman told us it didn't matter we'd just have to ask people to swap with us or we would have to pay a minimum of $150 per person to change seats to be together.  We went to complain and got sent to the priority check in desk. When we explained the situation, the person behind this desk said aggressively that the seats must all be sold out except the extra leg room seats. When I said the other person hadn't said these seats were extra leg room, just that we had to pay to sit together, she told me I must have heard her wrong or misunderstood her. The priority desk person then threw our passports and boarding passes on the counter and said aggressively ""you're all set"", when I asked ""what do you mean"" she rose her voice and said ""I put you guys together!"" and gave a shooing motion towards us with her hand. No apologies, no explanations. We the continued to the American Airlines security area, put our things in boxes and queued up to go through. A security person, again aggressively shouted at people saying ""you have to stay with your boxes"", so my boyfriend and I stayed in the queue to go through next to our boxes about a foot away. The same person then came very close to my face and said ""Miss is that your box?"" To which I responded ""yes"". He then said condescendingly ""who's pushing your box down the line?"" I didn't understand the question because in every other airport you put your box in the row and staff make sure it goes through the machine for you. So I looked at him confused at which point he aggressively pointed at the box and me and shouted ""who's pushing your box down the line?"" At which point I felt really intimidated and said ""I am?"" Then he said ""exactly. Then get over there."" I felt humiliated.  So I got on the queue and walked in to the body scanner when called, stood on the yellow feet on the floor then the next security person again with horrible attitude said ""did you got through pre-security?"" I looked back saw there was nothing else behind me but the area I had just been shouted at in and said ""yes."" He then said sarcastically ""you look like you're wearing sandals"". Clearly I was. So I said ""yes"". He then said in an accusatory, rude voice ""you were supposed to take them off and put them through the x-ray scanner"" and gave me a shooing motion so I returned to the x-ray scanner, put my shoes in a box and got back in the queue. Just to clarify there were no signs or messages saying you needed to push your boxes or take off your sandals. The whole experience left me feeling awful. There are plenty of far better, cheap airline carriers out there. "
1906,"American Airlines flight from Boston to Charlotte was scheduled to land at 9:48pm. It instead landed at 10:30pm which was the departure time of my next flight, the airline offered no refund and gave me a flight the next day and sent me off with a pat on the back. Needless to say I'm annoyed."
1907,"  New York JFK to Manchester. American Airlines is probably the worst airline I've ever flown with. After boarding we were kept waiting on the group for around 1h50 mins with very little explanation of why. I was sat at the rear of the aircraft and as there is no closed off area for staff they were pretty much just sat around chatting loudly (which is fine, but on most aircraft they have a closed off area and can do it without everyone having to listen). This aircraft had no seat back TVs so we had nothing to do. After take off we were given a very poor dinner, although there was a good selection of drinks. The experience so far was generally poor, but mildly acceptable considering it's a budget airline. However the last 2 hours of the flight were awful. Suddenly the smoke alarms began to sound and the staff very casually checked the aircraft for signs of danger (this was only looking in bathrooms and touching walls for signs of heat) for about 10 minutes. The alarms sounded for the remainder of the flight with no announcement or instructions to reassure passengers. Awful, avoid American Airlines."
1908," Me and my family managed to grab a bargain with American Airlines on our most recent vacation from Glasgow to Orlando via Philadelphia. The price was more than 70% cheaper than any other airline operating the route, however if I knew the misery we would have to endure then I definitely wouldn't have flown with AA. The first problem arose at check in (GLA-PHL) where we were allocated new seats from the ones we had previously purchased resulting in my family being split up throughout the aircraft. We complained and was given new seats nearby each other but still not the ones we had paid £200 for previously, which American Airlines are still refusing to issue a refund. Next when we arrived at the gate we were informed that the flight was delayed but that it wouldn't be long and they were going to commence boarding - not long turned into sitting on the aircraft for almost 2 hours. The aircraft was old, in need of refurbishing, extremely cramped and didn't have personal inflight entertainment which American Airlines didn't tell us while booking. The aircraft did have an overhead screen which played one movie during the 7hrs 45min flight to Philadelphia, however me, and many other people sitting around us thought it was unsuitable for children to view. The staff were rude, never came across people with such bad manners, talked inappropriately about passengers onboard the aircraft (which we have complained about) and couldn't be bothered doing their job but instead stand at the back of the aircraft talking. The food was poor quality, even for airplane food, and was thrown down in front of us. The aircraft landed just over 2 hours late making it tight for our connection to Orlando. Once on the connecting flight we were told that our bags had missed the connection and would be sent on the next flight out, not the best news for the start of you're holiday. We had a mad dash to the flight, just making it by minutes to spare, and once we sat down were told that the flight was delayed due to technical problems resulting in another 2 hour delay. The staff were slightly friendlier on the connection to Orlando and we eventually landed about 5 hours late (thunderstorms near Orlando delayed us). We got off the aircraft rather quickly and proceeded to baggage information for American Airlines which told us that our bags wouldn't be arriving until the next afternoon, we were offered several thousand air miles as compensation which we rejected as we had already decided we will never touch American Airlines again. Our bags eventually arrived the next evening but an extremely poor service and lack of information from American Airlines. I definitely do not recommend."
1909,"  Not the best long-haul experience. My seat was changed while boarding to a row far away from my travel companion, no explanation or apology was provided. Gate staff at PHL are extremely rude, bordering on hostile, and are in need of serious customer service retraining. I do not appreciate PHL gate staff barking orders at passengers and not using the PA system prior to a 9 and a half hour long-haul flight. Upon boarding, a passenger opened a box of very smelly food and proceeded to eat it during push back - flight attendants did nothing to intervene. The quantity of diner food items was very stingy for such a long flight, and I would have been starving if I did not bring my own food. Flight attendant servicing my row was also stingy with the complimentary wine - would not offer a refill until dinner service was completed. The trip back to the US was a completely different and very positive experience."
1910,"  Honolulu to Los Angeles. Was notified my plane was delayed this afternoon. When I asked why I was told ""I don't know"" by both customer service on the phone and customer service at the airport. How can an Airline not know why their planes are delayed. No apologies or anything. My 8 hour trip became 12 hours by the time its all said and done. I'm 6'4"" tall and theres no leg room unless I pay $50.00 for First class so no sleeping foe me. I woke up early and planned my day around original flights. I now will be up over 24 hours because they can't get it right. No compensation either. "
1911,"  Boston to Minneapolis via La Guardia. Zero customer service. Our flight was cancelled from New York LGA to Minneapolis and American Airlines will not offer any hotel vouchers any cots, blankets or food. I will never ever fly with American Airlines again. Our customer service agent was texting her friends while we were waiting for her answers. One agent got up and walked away and there were 30 people waiting. "
1912, We flew with American Airlines from Hartford to Orange County via Dallas. My wife and I had to use the customer services of wheelchair. We found the staff helpful and accommodating. We felt we were taken care off. Staff of AA were courteous on our journey. Will fly AA again.
1913,"  Houston to Albuquerque via Dallas. The airline of excuses and terrible customer service. I said never again the last time I flew American, and I confirmed why today. Rude service, constant delays and lame excuses to explain those delays. I will try to avoid this company as much as I can and fly Southwest instead."
1914,"  It gets a 1 because zero wasn't an option. Our flight originated in Rapid City, SD connecting through Dallas/Ft. Worth, TX and then on to Newark, NJ. We checked four bags/items ($75 b/c the stroller was free) at the urging of the gate attendant at check-in because they advised the flight would be full and there would be little room in the overhead compartments. Upon arriving in Newark, we picked up two bags and the stroller but the other piece of luggage was nowhere to be found. The surly woman in the baggage claim area of American Airlines (AA) said that the bag was put on the wrong flight but that it would arrive later in the evening and be delivered within 24 hours. I then took the day off work ... but the bag never arrived. Several phone calls later, what we know is that they can't find our bag and that they really aren't particularly concerned about it. Almost every representative that we've spoken with in the baggage handling customer service department has been less helpful than the one before. They cannot locate the bag and they're ""not sure what else to tell us at this point"" (that's a quote). Meanwhile, I'm out an expensive Rimowa bag and several thousand dollars in clothing and other items. Some of them with sentimental value and which can never be replaced. Any effort at replacing our items will be a tedious and time consuming process and I'm sure will be laden with red tape and bureaucratic obstacles. And they won't even begin that process for 5 days. Even though they admit that they can't locate the bag and it's coming up on 48 hours here shortly. American Airlines is a joke, they lose your luggage and basically laugh at you when you seek assistance. Two days later and they have no idea where our checked bag is now? This has to be the worst and least helpful customer service. The poorly trained customer service reps at AA are flippant, unhelpful, and totally unsympathetic to one's plight. The fact that this airline carries the name ""American"" in the company's moniker is a disgrace. If you value your personal belongings and don't appreciate being treated like yesterday's used up garbage, do yourself a favor and either find another airline to fly or just stay home."
1915,"  
An overall pleasant flight from Rome to Philadelphia - aside from the complimentary hot meal and wine/beer, free pretzels and water/juice were available at the rear of the aircraft throughout the flight. In addition, ice cream was provided mid-flight, followed by a hot savory snack as well as a sweet snack. Personal screens offered a wealth of options, and seats featured a USB port for device charging. Flight attendants were all friendly and helpful, although a few were a bit more informal that they should have been. This is a much better product in terms of value for money than British Airways offers at the moment."
1916,"  Jamaica to Indianapolis via Charlotte. Extremely poor customer service. We had a 5 hour layover in Charlotte on our way to Indianapolis and there were earlier flights available, but they refused to switch our flight. There was availability on a flight that was 4 hours earlier, but they said since we had paid a lower fare they would not switch us, even after we tried to pay the difference. They gained nothing by making us wait for no reason and lost a customer."
1917,"  Seattle to Knoxville via Dallas. I'm writing this review while sitting in the terminal in Dallas. Our flight out of Seattle was delayed, but we still made it in time to make our connection in Dallas if we ran like maniacs to the next terminal, which we did. When we got to our gate, with 5 minutes to spare, the doors were already closed. The plane sat there for at least 20 more minutes. We were told during our flight that they often held flights for 10 minutes when a flight like our with so so many connecting flights was late. Not only not only not held, but it was shut early! Thanks American! We were booked on a later flight without a hint of an apology or an explanation. Again thanks American! We'll get home at after 4:00 am. Thanks American! Do you have computers? Can you see connecting flights just landed? Do you care? Can you be polite to your customers?"
1918,"  London Heathrow to Los Angeles. After landing at LAX we were bussed (an extra 30 mins delay) to Terminal B. The AA website said T4 but was never updated. At no time did any AA staff update customers of the change. Terminal B involved 2 hours of shuffling with luggage through 3 security barriers. Then we had to find our driver waiting at Terminal 4, another hour of delays plus we had to walk between terminals. What a disgusting lack of service. I will never fly American Airlines again."
1919,"  Nashville to Lawton via Dallas Ft Worth. My initial flight was going to be over three hours late on departure due to a mechanical problem with the aircraft. I was able to book another flight out of Nashville. However on this flight, I was forced to check my carry-on bag because the overhead storage areas were full. After boarding this aircraft I noticed many items in the overhead storage that the flight crew should have required to be placed under the seats; things like shopping bags and purses. When I arrived at DFW for my connection I noted an earlier flight to my final destination that would save me 3 hours stuck in the airport. I proceeded to that gate and attempted to go standby. I was told that I was not eligible for that flight because I must travel with my checked bag. That's right, the bag I was forced to check against my will. This could have been prevented if the flight crew monitored what was being placed in the overhead storage. I rarely fly AA on purpose. And when I do, without fail, I am reminded why I avoid them."
1920,"  Being able to fly First Class on a transcontinental route (New York to San Diego) is certainly a treat that I looked forward to. I decided to treat myself to the Admirals Club at JFK which to me was one of the highlights of the journey. Great healthy snacks, fresh guacamole and well made cocktails. The aircraft cabin was standard with leather seats, ample space and well stocked personal Samsung tablets. Now, I believe First Class service should be special including the check-in, what happened to the First Class Check in? It's just ""Priority""! The food was quite tasty albeit the meals were different from what the web-site listed in the pre-order. Here's the issue: the FA's were nothing but robotic and functioning. Fake smiles with minimal service. One drink service, expedited food presentation and that was it! I had to get up to get a simple glass of water. More time was spent in the galley complaining to each other about the company, which was easy to over hear, rather then taking caring of the premium paying passengers, First Class FA's should represent the high standard of the Airline. American is doing a great job but customer service should be a paramount determinant."
1921,"  I've always been big on traveling but since mid 2013 I have been taking around 8-20 flights a year, domestic and international, mostly for business purposes. Out of all the airlines I have taken (and I fly to some remote places in the world) American Airlines have managed to be the most consistent with their lack of customer care and disorganization and just a huge shame to what you would expect of one of the biggest airlines coming out of the US. Canceling and delaying is something that happens so often that I have become shocked when their flights go as planned, they offer no compensation of course for those delays and time and energy consuming horrible experiences that everyone hates. American Airlines offer no canceling/bumping a flight like 90% of the time, just zero effort to even try and show just a little bit of courtesy toward the customer in general. "
1922,"  Greenville to Las Vegas return via DFW. My biggest complaint is when I was dropped off by a tour company at Las Vegas (after a 14 days trip) for my return trip home 6+ hours before the flight boarded American refused to check my bags. They said their policy was not to accept baggage until four hours before a flight. Effectively I was being asked to sit in the main departure lobby for 3.5 hours to check luggage. This was unacceptable. After I complained to a self-check attendant she finally agreed to issue boarding passes and said we could gate check one piece of luggage each complimentary. I had been unable to check in electronically due to the tour and spotty internet access. We carried four pieces of luggage, one carry-on each and one piece each we intended to check, to Gate D which is a really long hike. We did this and were accommodated but had to sit with the luggage all evening and take it with us when we went to eat. None of this made sense. Why would American risk making a customer angry and forego $50 ($25 each checked bag x 2) in revenue by refusing to check bags on arrival and forcing gate check? We were tired, hungry, facing a red-eye flight and just wanted to be shed of the baggage. Now let's backtrack to our departure from Greenville-Spartanburg. The flight crew did not show up on time. The captain and first flight attendant showed up for the flight at 7:50 for an 8:05 flight. The other attendant/s and co-captain showed up at 8 sharp. Needless to say we left late. Our connection through DFW was not pleasant. When our flight landed we sat on the tarmac for over 30 minutes waiting for a gate. We were told we would taxi to three different gates before the plane actually moved to the original one. We barely made our connection with time for a restroom break. When we departed Las Vegas McCarran to return home the rest rooms at Gate D used by American were filthy. A janitorial staff member was present but did not appear to be doing much. Many urinals in the men's room were cordoned off and out of service. The final leg from Charlotte to Greenville-Spartanburg was on a very old CRJ500 that was so old the upholstery on the head rests was peeling off. This was our first experience with American and may be our last."
1923,  Flew Washington to Tampa. American Airlines is the worst airline possible. They are currently 2 hours behind flight time for no apparent reason and are offering no sort of compensation for the delay time. The whole flight has been delayed from 8.20 pm land time to 10.20 pm land time.
1924,"  Dallas to Houston. Flight was originally scheduled to leave at July 23rd 9:45pm and was delayed to 1:38am and then canceled. When I asked what my options were after waiting in line at the customer service counter, they said the next flight available would be at July 24th 5:42pm. Why on earth would it be more than a 12hr wait to one of the busiest international airports (George Bush IAH)? I got another flight with United Airlines 6:30am the next morning. They never re-imbursed me even tho they said they would."
1925,"  This was an awful experience. American Airlines ""business class"" is a rip off. Given the choice just a few hours before boarding to ""upgrade"" to business class for $80 USD for the first leg of my journey, I thought it seemed like a good idea - wrong! My $80 upgrade bought me a slightly larger seat and 1 premium beer! There was no food, other than a snackbar served on the 4-hour flight between Merida and Miami, and then when I had a 3-hour layover in Miami before getting my connecting fight, my first class ticket wouldn't even give me access to the premium lounge, which was the principal reason I had upgraded! This was a total rip-off and maddening."
1926,  Nassau to Pittsburgh via Miami. I was traveling  with my 2.5 year old daughter and the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. This was only her 2nd flight and I truly appreciate everything both flight attendants did to make our flights so enjoyable! Thank you again.
1927," You know it's bad when American Airlines staff are complaining about how bad their employer is. I went to Greece 3 weeks ago and now coming back through Philadelphia to Los Angeles with the same issues - nothing but delays. First going the flight was delayed by 3 hours and we ultimately missed our connecting flight when I had to spend the night in Philadelphia. Now, I'm coming back to the states and right when we left the dock, the plane had to be called back because there are 15 passengers and 25 bags that needed to be picked up. Why is this airline always late or unorganized? Terrible. You couldn't pay me to fly with American Airlines again."
1928,"  New York JFK to San Diego. This is the second time I travel to San Diego with American Airlines and I haven't had the best experience. Both times the plane was delayed or the people took too long to open the bridge. Last night, we departed late and got to San Diego later than expected time. I would like more for my money because this flight wasn't cheap. It didn't have a screen in back of every seat like Delta and JetBlue, they also didn't have options with snacks."
1929,"  My family was returning home from a wonderful vacation that included a Cruise. We arrived at Ontario, CA airport 09.30 pm for a flight departing at 11.59 pm. Upon arrival my sister dropped me off at the terminal with our luggage and proceeded to return rental car. The American Skycap helped me get the luggage inside when I started to tip him, I discovered my wallet and phone were missing. Firstly the skycap called my sister continuously with no reply (kudos to him). I was panicked as you may imagine, my next contact was a very knowledgeable and caring ticket agent. She picked up her phone and tried to reach Hertz who did not answer her many phone calls on my behalf, then called airport police. Officer also attempted to contact Hertz with no avail. Finally, my sister arrived and went back to Hertz and the car and found my wallet and phone, all was well. I want to say a huge thank you to our ticket agent who also checked us in, for everything she did. When we reached the gate the agent they knew my name and asked if I had found my wallet. Kudos to the entire Ontario, CA Int, staff and especially to our American Airlines ticket agent."
1930,"  There's always one carry on allowed to be carried to the plane. I fly with this airline a lot. Last time when I was flying back to Hartford from Dallas airport, they did not let me take my carry on with me to the plane and told me it was bigger size than usual. However I always take the same carry on to the plane and have never had any problems. They checked it in and when I entered the airplane I saw a lot of empty spaces on the overhead container and I saw carry ons that were much fatter and wider than my carry on. I had to wait 30 minutes after arrival to the airport to get my carry on back from baggage claim! It was such a waste of time when I could have easily carried it with me to the plane. I got home at 2 am that night! "
1931,"  La Guardia to Dallas Ft Worth. American Airlines is definately the worst for being on time. I flew on Tuesday July 18, 2017 from LGA, 3 hours late at 9 am in the am. Then we boarded, then we waited for another half hour, they remembered they needed a pilot - 30 minutes after that, remembered that fuel need to be balanced. Now, 2 days later, 2.5 hours late again. The stewardess just announced after sitting inside the plane for the past hour ""there are some funny points to this flight"". How is wasting people's time for the past two days by over six hours funny? Then give you 1 package of cookies."
1932,  Boston to Chicago. Such a disappointment. Customer service was rough if you fly business or economy no one cares no matter how much money you spend on the ticket. Front desk are cold and lazy. Cant get into the lounge even if you are flying business - they only let members into the lounge what's up with that? People paying for the cheap seats get in but those spending the extra dollar are refused.
1933,"  Philadelphia to Dallas Ft Worth. On our trip, we were delayed due to weather. We were very pleased with how American Airlines' customer service took care of us. They re-routed us while we were on the delayed flight because they knew we wouldn't catch our next flight. They contacted us immediately to give us our new flights. When we arrived in Dallas, our bags did not make it. They contacted us the minute we exited the plane to let us know they would be delivered so we didn't have to wait in baggage claim. Their customer service was outstanding."
1934,"  Minneapolis to Tampa via Charlotte. I asked for a blanket to the flight attendant, she said ""blankets are only for first class"". I could see many blankets store on the top compartments of the plane that no one was using. Does that make sense? When did we lose our humanity?  Everyone should have the right to have a blanket, specially if there are many not being used."
1935,  I was headed from Chicago to Dallas Fort Worth with an 80 year old friend to attend her grandson's wedding. Upon arrival I dropped my friend off at the curb of the airport while I parked my vehicle. An American Airline employee saw me and immediately assisted me. Even though he was not yet on duty he still jumped in and helped me from start to finish. The flight was smooth and I cannot thank George and American Airlines enough for their wonder service!
1936,  Eight flights in last ten days with American. All OK basic average. Then arrived in San Diego missing one very important bag. American staff at the baggage handling area were neither good or bad and they advised me the bag would arrive next morning at 10:30. American Airlines employ a contractor or perhaps it's two contractors to handle late baggage delivery. My experience of this is that information available on whereabouts of your bag/s is very hard to obtain. The information on the delivery contractor/s website is wrong and not updated. Call handling by American Airlines is utterly appalling and amateurish. Call handling agents do not have required information easily to hand and that indicates American Airlines have a garbage infrastructure. After several phone calls one AA call handler kindly let me know the name of the delivery contractor and I was able to finally find out where my bag was and coordinate delivery directly with the contractor. I am shocked and a bit angry to note just how useless AA have been in fixing this not uncommon problem. 
1937,  Richmond to Kansas City. I feel I was forced to purchase premium seats ($185) because there was no available regular seats available to choose from to guarantee me a seat.  I would have chosen any regular seat to try to keep my cost as low as possible. When I contacted the airline they informed me that I would have been assigned one of those premium seats for free if I would not have already paid for it.  I'm sorry but I do not want to take a chance of getting bumped from a flight because I did not have an assigned seat.
1938,"  Tallahassee to Vail via Dallas Ft Worth. We are the only ones in priority check in just to be ignored while employees are having a great time talking and laughing. Then the one employee checking coach class customers helped 2 other customers while we felt like fools for paying first class prices. All was well and the 1st class cabin was comparable to competitors. Food was a disgrace. Service was good. White wine was served warm with no apologies. On our return again ignored while standing in priority check in while watching coach class customers jump ahead. Again food was a disgrace. This time the stewardess did say the white wine was not yet cold. And gave us the option of warm or waiting a while for it to chill. While waiting to board in DFW we ask if there would be a meal served. Trying to decide if we needed to purchase and carry on something for lunch. To our surprise neither of the 2 AA employees knew and had no idea how to find out. I guess my biggest problem is that first class prices should be supported with first class service and food. Our expectations are based on Delta's 1st class service. Pre flight video wasted no time bragging about being the largest airline with 6700 planes. And yes that's impressive, But please note, I can only fly in one plane at a time and really expect that flight to compare to the airlines with less than 6700 planes.  AA, clean up your first class service."
1939,"  Virginia Beach to Chicago via Charlotte. About 50-60% of the time there is an issue. Typically, a delay. My latest experience not only included a delay, a cancellation, and then a flight change to one full day later, it also included a 3 hour cluster-you-know-what of uncertainty as to where our baggage was. The ticket tracing system was completely usesless and when I attempted to speak to one of their robotic customer service reps, I was told that there was nothing that could be done and that my bags would be available the next day in Chicago. (We were trapped in Charlotte for the night). The issue is that at the time of flight change to make up for the cancellation, we were guaranteed by an AA rep that our baggage would be released upon arrival in Charollette. When trying to explain this to the baggage service rep, I was told I was wrong, and that nobody could go get the bag for over 5 hours. There are many more details surrounding the disrespectful way that the baggage claim rep handled the situation but my qualm is with the rip-off that is AA as an organization""."
1940," Although I had an American Airlines economy class ticket I was able to select an aisle seat in premium economy which has a 3-3-3 seat layout. The cabin was packed for this flight from London to New York JFK. The plane departed on time but after landing at JFK could not find a gate for over 40 minutes making a mockery of arriving on time. We sat strapped listening to regular updates from the cockpit. The plane was clean; the toilet ran out of tissue paper and a flight attendant had to be told. Soon after takeoff a packet of salted pretzel was given out to the passengers but no drinks leaving my mouth totally dry. Dinner was served soon after with complimentary wine and beer. I chose a pasta dish. The small tray was overloaded with smallish portions from all the food groups - salad, bread, entree, dessert. A hot snack was provided before landing. A large selection of films on the personal IFE but the free headphone provided was so poor in quality that I did not watch or listen to anything as the sound was inaudible over the roar of the engines. Advice: bring your own headphones. The seat was not comfortable at all. The padding and cushioning was rather thin. Worse was the tapping you felt on your back whenever the passenger behind pressed buttons on her IFE to select items for viewing - so thin was the cushioning. Not to mention the lack of any lumbar support. Flight attendants were dutiful and appeared when needed. Overall, another unmemorable flight and totally unimpressed with premium economy."
1941,"  Orlando to Montego Bay via Charlotte. Terrible experience with American Airlines. We were very excited to go to our vacation this morning, But all these flight delays make us upset. Our flight to Miami was delayed for 1hour then we wait for hour and half more and eventually it was just canceled. It was looking nobody care about people in American Airlines. Information desk was closed when hundred people needed solutions to rebook flight. We eventually were rerouted to Jamaica by way of Charlotte, and experienced more delays at the gate for that flight! After finally boarding, then they made us sit on the plane for an hour and then one more, we were trapped in airplane! We should be on the beautiful Jamaica Resort at 2pm but it's looking we will be lucky to finally arrive at our destination by midnight."
1942,"  New Orleans to Dallas Ft Worth, I have been an American Airlines Advantage member for several years. I used 60000 rewards miles to book flight 1300 from New Orleans to Dallas. In addition to 60,000 miles, I was charged $75.00 for booking too close to the date of travel, and $11.20 in tax. I live far from the airport. It takes at least 1.5 hours to travel each way between my home and MSY. I arrived at 3:15 pm for the scheduled departure of flight 1300 at 5:25pm. Not long before 5:25 pm, passengers were advised the flight was delayed until 8:00 pm. At 8pm the flight was cancelled. At this time I had been travelling 8 hours including waiting in the airport. The gate personnel advised the flight would be rescheduled to 7/11. I was travelling to a memorial service scheduled for 7/11. I was unable to make the memorial service. I was offered a hotel room and a meal voucher, but not offer a seat on another airline. I doubt I will ever again fly with American. For years American was my choice for air travel. Not now. It appears they little or no respect for their customers."
1943,"  Our flight to Philadelphia was cancelled. We did not receive a text or email. We found out when we landed in Portland and checked the screen to find out the gate for our flight to Philadelphia. We spent hours in Portland and had to take a flight to Dallas and then Philadelphia. When we reached Dallas we were told there were earlier flights to Philadelphia we could been on but our luggage was already on the later flight. It took an additional 9 hours to get home, sitting in airports. We were not given any voucher for food or anything else.  Then they lost some of our luggage which was delivered to us at 2:45 AM. After 36 hours of no sleep, I was awakened by a call at 2:30AM that my luggage was being delivered. The personnel are rude, not helpful at all."
1944,  Flew Dallas to Seattle with American Airlines. Our flight there was fine. Everything went fine. On the way back the weather was bad. Our flight got cancelled they didn't have another flight for us. So we had to wait another 24 hrs just to get on a flight. Finally got ready to board and the plane had engine issues. So we ended up sitting on the plane for 2 hrs waiting for a new gate to be towed to. We had to wait another hr for another plane. We get on the plane and had to wait another hour for catering and baggage. I had my 3 kids and come to find out they didn't offer any food at this time because it was too late - we had been at the airport since 7.30pm and we did not make it home until 2 am. They didn't even attempt to make up for anything. It was horrible.
1945, I was on an American Airlines flight from Newark to Houston via Dallas. The flight was delayed for 2.5 hours for an unknown reason. We finally get onto the plane and the seats are compact. We landed Dallas for our connecting flight and rush to the gate to Houston and we find out the gate is closed. The flight didn't even leave yet but they woundnt let us on. The next flight was the next day in the evening. We had to spend extra money on a motel. I will never fly with American Airlines again.
1946," American Airlines check in was very easy and we dropped off our bags at the bag drop. I am Pre Check so security was quick. However the gate area was crowded as the flight from Phoenix to Maui was full so it was hard to hear boarding announcements. Gate agent was pleasant. This is a B757 which means it is old. There is no seat-back IFE just the large monitors placed throughout the cabin. Didn't watch the movie because the sound was not very good. I had my tablet with me so I just watched a couple of downloaded movies on the 6 hour flight. Flight attendants came through the cabin a couple of times with drinks and selling snacks. One of the attendants was cranky but the others were very pleasant. Seat was worn and could use an upgrade. The flight was generally comfortable, we left on time and arrived on time and our bags were out about 20 minutes after we landed. Overall a reasonably good flight. Sometimes I think only people with bad experiences write on these review sites. I have generally been pleased with AA."
1947,"  Miami to Washington Dulles. Was supposed to depart at 8:40am, something about a log blog not being in the plane so we waited until 10:30am to leave. I feel it shouldn't have taken that long and should have been noticed way before we boarded the plane. Plus side we got a snack, but as the vegan wrap was disgusting."
1948,"  It was a terrible experience flying from San Francisco to Dallas Fort Worth with American Airlines. Flight delayed for 2 hours and service was horrible. After landing in DFW, we had to wait an hour for baggage. No one explained why we had to wait! I missed my hotel shuttle because I waited for baggage until 1.30 am. I had to pay for a taxi to get me to the hotel. Do not fly with American Airlines, if your time valuable"
1949,"  New York JFK to Los Angeles. I was an American Airlines Advantage member for few years, and this is the first, and probably the last time I use them! Absolutely terrible from every possible angle. To begin with before I signed up for AA program it was many benefits included but not limited to Priority boarding. Which was pretty good, since I used it with different airlines. Now things changes and you get regular boarding, they just put you ahead in group number 5, but customer service at the gate of JFK was so terrible that you literally have to fight to get on board with your group since all people lined up and in rush. Another thing they forcing people to check carry on. Old planes. On the way back from Vegas even worse. Same thing customer service at the gate is so terrible, had 2 small carry on bags and wallet over my shoulder she screamed at me that I had 3 bags. Stopped me and was very impolite saying that I had to put my wallet inside my bag."
1950,"  Flew American Airlines from Belize to Manchester via Los Angeles. Flight late, so missed connecting flight. Lost my luggage, unbelievably rude Baggage Claim. I had to locate bag 4 days later, no contact. No food on 5 hour US flight, awful meal on transatlantic flight. Charge for checked in luggage. Grudging rude staff. Full on prices, pared down service and facilities. Very expensive low budget standard airline. No entertainment on 5 hour flight unless have own device on which app may or may not load. In any event has to be done before you fly. Avoid."
1951,  Dallas Ft Worth to Beijing. I normally use British Airways for long haul but decided to change because of poor service. The plane was new and the business class seats comfortable. Probably the best entertainment I have seen on any flight. Food menu was bland but this is normal on some western carriers. American could be world class if only they taught their staff to be human and empathetic. If they concentrated on making the passengers comfortable rather than themselves it would have made the grade. Conclusion better than British Airways but not as good as Cathay.
1952,"  Sacramento to Grand Rapids. American Airlines staff are very rude when asking about delays. I don't fly much so I get anxious when things change and they are not understanding. The flight attendants are great though. As far as the airline as a whole. I'm so fed up with all of the delays and problems they have. I'm getting back 2 hours late after an already late arrival from Sacramento to Grand Rapids. I asked if they could place me in a hotel for the night as I live far from Grand Rapids, so on top of arriving late I will have to drive for a while as well. They looked at me like I was crazy. Not to mention the money I've had to spend on food while waiting because I planned to be home. And they switched my terminal 3 times and by the time I got to my gate they switched it and to go all the way back to where I started. Definately not flying with them again - not impressed at all."
1953," Everything is in the fine print when you book a ticket with American. We bought three tickets from Boston to Chicago and paid for three, yet they gave one of the seats away. The answer if you look at the fine print, you agreed to the terms. That's way I try to fly SW, Jetblue and others."
1954,"  Augusta to Albuquerque via Charlotte. American Airlines flies most Eastern US Flights through a Charlotte Hub. Their timing in Charlotte does not account for the ""chain of comedy"" error that are built into domestic flights governed by the TSA. In a recent round trip from Augusta GA to Albuquerque NM; the return was routed from Albuquerque to Phoenix to Chicago to Charlotte to Augusta. The lay-over in CLT was scheduled as 56 minutes. The flight in Chicago did not board until 25 minutes after scheduled. The pilot taxied to a runway, waited 10 minutes and announced windspeed was too high to take off, waited another 15 minutes, then taxied to another runway where he announced the wind speed was fine, we were 5th in line for take off. Arrived in CLT and deboarded at 10:12 PM at terminal B16, connecting flight doors close at E24, 10:20 PM. Needless to say, missed flight. American Airline customer service unapologetically offered a hotel and a 9:30 AM flight the next day as only option. Problem - had appointment that I could not miss at 9;30 AM in Augusta. I pushed it - wanted a rental, AA agent got a bit nasty. No rentals available, took car service back (probably cheaper than a 1 way rental in the end). Still arguing with AA - they claim total liability is $90 - the land mile % of total trip that was unused. They blame wind, weather, airport flight controllers and ""me"". I have been an engineer and project manager for almost 20 years, part of the measurement of my job performance is my ability to meet schedule commitments. Why is it that AA believes meeting schedule commitments is optional?"
1955,"  Cincinnati to Birmingham via Charlotte. I'm trying to remain kind and sweet, but this is the third flight with American Airlines in the span of 3 days that has been delayed, resulting in an overnight stay, and arriving a day later than planned to my destination. Customer service was nonchalant and unapologetic when I missed my connecting flight as a result of delays. If at all possible, I will avoid flying with American Airlines in the future."
1956,"  Charlotte to Los Angeles. Posting this as I was surprised that American Airlines doesn't provide blankets to coach class, only to first class passengers. I normally fly with Delta, and they have never failed to provide blankets. Just so you are informed and can be prepared. The flight attendants are not as attentive."
1957,"  Denver to Dallas Ft Worth. Boarding the plane- the ladies checking boarding passes were extremely rude to passengers. The pilot just about took us out trying to get down the JetWay to the plane. The manager was rude when coming through jetway to get checked carry on luggage down. There are ways to say ""excuse me"" if you are trying to get by. Stewardess was rude on the flight as well. What happened to hospitality, kindness, and manners in this place?"
1958,"  Charlotte to Orlando. The man working at the desk where you scan you ticket was so rude. He looked at my bag and said it was too big to carry on and said it wouldn't fit. He was rude the way he said it. My bag has fit on every plane I've taken it on. Including the American Airlines flight I just got off of 1 hour ago. There was plenty of room on the overhead compartments went I got on the plane, now I'm inconvenienced by having to stop by baggage claim."
1959,  Flew American Airlines from Phoenix to Chicago. I was shocked upon getting to my seat. There was two partially wet napkins scattered on the seat with tons of crumbs and flakes. The women who was already seated said hers was like that as well and she pointed it out to stewardess and she said she was not concerned about it at all and just threw the napkins on my seat and said the person could just clean it up. What grossed me out the most was I never knew if the wet stuff was from the napkin or was on the seat from the previous passenger. You never know what it could be. I was shocked the stewardess was rude to the other passenger and seemed bothered she had to go get napkins. I fly a lot and never have had my seat so gross.
1960,"  Cleveland to Minneapolis via Chicago. I have never had such a disorganized, rude, and downright horrible customer service experience. Our first flight was delayed because of one single passenger's passport not going through. A flight full of about 60-70 people delayed 45 minutes for one individual - which should have been figured out by removing her from the flight, as there were many people (at least 25) whom had connecting flights they had to get to, including us. We had a connecting flight in Chicago that was leaving 30 minutes after we landed, prior to the delay time. We were instructed to call the delay hotline to find flights for our party of 8 from Chicago to Minneapolis, in case we did not make it in time to catch our connection. We arrived with about 10 minutes to spare because of a delay in the mechanics with said connecting flight. We got to the gate to assure we were going to make it and it turns out the hotline screwed up 3 of our seats and booked us for a flight leaving 5 hours later than our original take off time that we sprinted through O'Hare airport to make. While I understand screw ups, the attitudes of the ladies at the gate was absolutely unacceptable. Not once did we receive an apology, nor did they seem willing to help, even though we were originally very calm and cooperative. They acted as if it was our fault and even made a comment about my manners, while they continued to treat us poorly. They were well aware of the situation and knew our flight was arriving with little time to make it to the gate and knew the number of seats that were needed. It was in no way our fault, as we did as we were instructed each step of the way. I will never be flying American Airlines again and hope  I never have to deal with another one of the employees I encountered in this entire experience."
1961," The absolute worst experience I've ever had on an airline. I've flown Delta or United my entire life but flying from Dallas to Atlanta, American seemed like the way to go. Wrong. My flight was delayed, the flight crew was unorganized and upon landing in Atlanta they somehow managed to take us to a gate that had a broken jetway. We then had to get towed to another gate after 30-45 minutes of waiting. Very unorganized and not efficient in allowing passengers to make their connections."
1962,"  Flew from New York LGA to Chicago ORD on a flight that surpassed every expectation! It left and arrived on schedule. I had checked in a bag and it was on the luggage carousel soon after arrival. The in-flight service harkened back to the joyous days of flying. Two exceedingly courteous and solicitous flight attendants catered to the first class cabin whose 16 seats were all occupied. A full breakfast with choices was provided. Beverages were offered numerous times. Attendants came regularly to check on passenger wishes. Free giveaway headphones were offered to listen to music or watch a show on the drop down from the ceiling TV screens - no screens on the back of the seat in front. Bathroom was kept clean and tidy. A hot towel to refresh was another pleasant perk. Pilots kept us in the loop on the flight's progress. It was a very early morning flight on the first day of the month - the July issue of the inflight magazine was in the pocket and the crossword puzzle was quite engaging. The cabin was pleasant, spacious and clean with ample overhead space to stow bags. Very high performance by American Airlines! Hope they can repeat it again and again."
1963," I work in TX and work in NV, so I fly frequently Dallas DFW to Las Vegas, once every 2 weeks, and always by American Airlines because of the convenience (non-stop flight). AA is a Dallas Fort Worth based company. I am now a member of AA and a platinum Mastercard holder. I flew this morning (flight 542) in a seat that I upgraded paying $64. For this sum of money, I got to sit in 5C, a seat with a malfunctioning belt that refused to lock, I also got boarding privilege of Group 5 and my 2 bags were not the last to come out but close to last. It is an absolute disgrace that AA charges us $64 for an upgrade, for what? Did I mention the gate changes, on Sunday. I checked my gate online, and, I learnt that it was C10. The next day I got a boarding pass that said C7; while seated close to C7 we were told that it would be C8. Well we flew out of C24, I am glad I was paying attention, knowing that with this team anything was possible. AA is a very poorly run organization by people who are beyond caring. I think there were 2 seats in row 5 that had belts malfunctioning, 5C and 5E. Both the airline and DFW airport need a complete overhaul. Yes, everything in TX is big, but who gives a damn about dimensions, we want quality, we want efficiency."
1964," What can I say about American Airlines, well it's the worst airline I have flown with. I was meant to be flying from Las Vegas to Auckland via Los Angeles on 23 June 2017. It's now 26 June 2017 and I have only just got home. The first flight was delayed so I missed my connecting flight, and ended up being scheduled for the next flight 24 hours later. Found it difficult getting any help at LAX airport from AA, some staff told me to sleep on the floor, eventually I was put in a hotel for 2 nights but as I got there and gave my credit card we were promptly kicked out as the hotel was overbooked and they said American Airlines was coming to get us to take us to another hotel (there was 11 travellers in total) they never came. Had to make own way back to the airport. It was hot temperatures, and no one would provide us with bottled water. It took me an hour to get a $12 dinner voucher as I felt the $12 I got given wasnt good enough since $5 for a bottle of water at LAX. Got into Auckland airport eventually, no American Airlines staff anywhere to help. Went to baggage servies and they managed to get a staff member to talk to me. I feel like I have been treated poorly and I haven't been apologised to."
1965,"  Flew New York, NY to Birmingham, AL. So we had a major unexpected traffic delay while departing from New York causing the flight to arrive 2 hours behind schedule. Now of course I understand that the airline did not intentionally delay the flight however when asked for any assistance on booking a hotel, since I was told my flight was pushed over until the next morning, I was told by a representative both at the airport and on the phone that this was not their problem and just deal with it! Since I booked my trip through Expedia I gave them a call and they helped out with voucher covering a portion of my hotel fee as a courtesy which was very kind. It's not what you say it's how you say it! Never again will I fly American Airlines. "
1966," If you are in trouble, you can count on American Airlines. I lost my passport before my flight from Las Vegas to Toronto and you should see all they did for me. More than I could ask. They found me a solution, reorganize everything and didn't charge a cent for it. All the staff were great."
1967," American Airlines is honestly one of the worst I've flown. My flight from Columbia to Los Angeles via Dallas was re-routed due to weather, which is fine, however passengers were told they could not leave the plane or else they wouldn't be able to get back on for over 3 hours. Finally we were allowed to fly again and the staff at the gate seemed to not know where to redirect everyone to. They simply didn't plan ahead in any sort of way. When I was able to get my ticket (because the layover plane I previously had a ticket for has left long before), I had to wait 2 more hours because the flight crew had not arrived. The plane was  more and more delayed. Additionally, they gave no sort of accommodation to make up for the massive time gaps. They sat me and my father in the very back with no hope to move up due to their policy of overbooking. Hands down one of the worst airlines out there. They are unorganized and do not care in any way about the customer. They have no communication skills or ability to handle inconvenienced customers. Do not give them your money."
1968,"  After a bad flight experience with American Airlines 3 years ago, I was pretty hesitant to fly with American again but it was the best option for my needs and I believe in second chances. I arrived in Washington DC at IAD 2 hours before my 7.20 am flight to find that it had been delayed to 10.30 am and my connecting flight in Dallas had subsequently been changed to accommodate for the delay. Even though I asked two employees, nobody could give a definitive answer as to why the flight was delayed 3 hours. I realize that these things happen and my connection had been altered so I wasn't too upset with the changes, but once it was time to board the now 10.30 am flight things started to de-escalate. They boarded some passengers and then stopped and made everyone get off the plane because, our pilot was missing! There was a major miscommunication about where the pilot was and the flight staff didn't have much information to tell us at first. We later found out that he was at least an hour away at another airport in DC. Knowing that I only had a 1 hour layover between my newly rebooked flights, I was panicking. We were finally allowed to re board our flight after many miscommunications about the pilots whereabouts and the flight attendants seemed to find the entire situation comical or maybe they were trying to lighten the mood for their unpleased passengers? The only saving grace in this story is the employee at the gate counter. Without her help I would have certainly missed my connection, but because of her tremendous efforts I was able to make my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Of course, the trip home wasn't quite as terrible, but again I only had one hour to catch my connection and the flight leaving Oklahoma City was 30 minutes late and again I made my connection by 5 minutes. The flights themselves weren't worse or better than average and there are some very helpful employees, but I'm going to steer clear from American Airlines from now on."
1969,  Quite a disappointing flight with American Airlines. I was on a long haul flight lasting 9 hours flying from Dallas to Amsterdam. Even though I have a small frame I found that the seating was cramped. There was not much leg room. The inflight entertainment was not working - no sound. There was no lighting (ie for reading) when the cabin lights were turned off at night. Screens were suspended from the top of the cabin rather than one screen per person at the back of each seat - no choice of what to watch.
1970, American Airlines flight from Paris was canceled and caused us to experience a 24 hour delay in returning home. Connecting flight from Philadelphia to Denver was then also late by an hour. Ended up spending 23 hours total for this flight from Paris to Denver. After we were notified of the flight was canceled we were only given a phone number to call and had to reschedule our own flights on our own time.
1971,"  London Heathrow to New York JFK.  As we had missed our previous flight due to a delay, we had to be rebooked to a flight later that day which worked out fine. Having only frequently flown United to the US before, I was suprised by the friendly flight attendants. Inflight service and the IFE were fine. As the flights were on time. I appreciate that AA has refurbished thier Boeing 777 fleet and I really the ambient lightning and new IFE. However, cramping in another seat in every row (3-4-3 instead of 2-5-2) makes traveling really uncomfortable. As a 187 cm/88kg Person, the extremely narrow seats makes it always impossible to find a comfortable sitting position. Even our British Airways connecting service from HAM to LHR in an A320 had wider seats. Luckily, the flights from London to New York are not too long. I will avoid flying American the 777-fleet in the future which is a pity as I usually really like these aircraft type."
1972,"  Las Vegas to Los Angeles. Worst customer service ever! Plane was delayed 3 hours when we finally got on, only to sit at the gate for another hour with ""maintainance issues"". The crew would not give any information and were extremely rude. When I asked for a blanket for my 8 year daughter (it was 10:30pm) they said no. Sadly enough this is the 2nd time this happened to me on AA. Never again!"
1973," I do not recommend American Airlines. I had the worst experinec flying from LA to Dulles Washington. At the airport in LA they made my life miserable because I had my laptop along with my purse and back pack as a carry on. They told me that laptop is considered an additional bag and I have to shove it in my backpack to give the illusion that I am carrying 2 bags. On top of everything returning from Philadelphia I had a carry on bag full of glass souvenirs. They wanted me to check in the bag due to no overhead space. I had to empty my carry on to remove all the glass items for me to carry them on to the plane. Lord be hold, I walk on to the plane and there is plenty of room above. I have traveled a lot and never encountered such an unorganized company. I will never recommend or fly with this airline ever again."
1974,"  American Airlines cancelled our flight from Dublin to Chicago (not due to weather), but no call despite the fact that I had given them our cell number. They rerouted us to London, Chicago, but failed to mention it would take an extra day to get home. When I noticed this, I had to talk with a different agent in London to route us through Dallas. We ended up 5+ hours late and missed connecting flight, having to stay overnight in Seattle and buying new tickets for $350. AA refused to pay for hotel, meals, rebooked flight despite that they got us to our destination a day later. Will try to avoid them as much as possible in the future. "
1975,"  I was scheduled on an American Airlines flight last night from Phoenix to Omaha. We boarded the flight and then was told there was a mechanical. Not a problem. I’m a million miler and understand. As soon as the problem was fixed the pilots timed out. Once again I totally understand. I don’t want a fatigued pilot flying the plane and it is an FAA rule that the airline can’t ignore. The problems started after all this. They said they were getting new pilots and it could take a couple of hours so they wanted everyone to deplane. At this point I’m not thrilled but at least we are going to make it to Omaha and I should be able to at least get in a half a day’s work the next day. We wait for two hours and still no pilots. They make an announcement that the pilots are coming in on a flight in 15 minutes and will be at the gate directly across from us. That was great news but a total lie. A few minutes later I hear someone on a radio say the pilots had never acknowledged the tag. My understanding is pilots never respond to these requests so I’m not sure why they even try or get the passengers hopes up. So the plane lands and deplanes I see the pilots get off and walk away. The gate has still not told anyone. About a half hour later the gate agent announces the flight is officially cancelled. The airline knew there was a shortage of pilots and no one ever accepts a tag so why did they hold us all captive for four hours after they knew the flight would cancel anyway. I would have been fine if as soon as the pilots timed out they cancelled the flight knowing they didn’t have any pilots to cover it. Things like this are why people hate airlines. Not only did they make me miss a whole day of work, they wasted four hours of my day for no reason."
1976,"  
Flew American Airlines from Las Vegas to Dallas Fort Worth. Flight was delayed due to rain, there were no storms in sight just rain. When I called to change my flight to an earlier one I'd found the customer service representative was extremely impatient and rude. Not to mention, did not help with my request at all). This is the 3rd time in a year that I've experienced unnecessary delays and been late to numerous business meetings and picking up my kids from grandparents. This has cost me a lot of time stress and money."
1977,"  Overall I would say American Airlines is a pretty good airline. My outbound flight from London Heathrow to Charlotte was fine, as was the internal between Charlotte and LaGuardia. But as my return flight from New York to London Heathrow was overnight I went ahead and purchased extra legroom which included priority boarding. Except it didn't. Boarding was exactly the same and the extra legroom was minimal. I am 6 foot 3 inches tall and even with the extra space it was pretty close to my knees. ""Up to an extra 6 inches"" it said, well I suppose it is correct as I estimate 3 inches was what I got and technically that is up to 6 inches. Called customer services who refused to even entertain my complain. Shocking customer service.
"
1978,"  I would not recommend American Airlines to anyone. They had me stranded in Charlotte after lying to customers for hours about our delayed flight from Las Vegas to Charlotte. First it was weather related then an airline steward was ""missing"" but on her way which was the reason given for the prolonged delay, at that point it had been already 2+hrs. We finally boarded at 1am, sat there only for them to say the flight was now canceled with no valid reason. The Customer service agents were absolutely awful. Best part of this all is they tell us there are no flights to Charlotte until 10.45pm the following day which was also a lie, they would not offer hotel comp stating that it was weather related delay and they were not responsible for it. So we board a flight to NY, then to Boston get here only to be told that my luggage is in Charlotte and it arrived at 7am, somehow my luggage got here before I did. American Airlines should be ashamed of themselves."
1979," Once again, my American Airlines flight from Birmingham to Dallas was delayed and caused me to miss a full days of work. My flight was scheduled to leave Birmingham at 9:32a I didn't leave until 4:45p. Now on the flight leaving Texas back to Birmingham, here I am still at the airport 3 hours after my scheduled flight. This is a business paid for flight. However I still think it is horrible the things I go through every time I fly American Airlines. They even canceled my return flight back to Birmingham without my knowing. It was taken care of however that was still a potential inconvenience. Today they loaded us on the plane. We sat on the plane for an hour, they tell us something is wrong. We have to walk out of the plane. We get back in they change our gate 3 times. This is always the worst flying experience."
1980,"  Flew from Austin to New York. This is the third time I have had problems with American Airlines. I am done giving them chances. They are constantly delaying and canceling flights and they do a horrible job with accommodations. I strongly advise you to choose a different airline unless you feel like sleeping in the airport waiting for a flight 15 hours later.
"
1981," My wife and I traveled from Kauai to Sacramento with a connection in Phoenix with American Airlines. The flight crew was late arriving at the airport in Kauai and we were over 30 minutes late departing to Phoenix. We arrived 20 minutes late in Phoenix. Because of the delay, we missed our connection to Sacramento. They closed the door early just as we ran up to the gate. I complained to the American Airlines customer service representative. She told me it was my fault for the missed connection and that I should not have booked the flights so close together. I tried to explain that it was a prepackaged AA flight connection that my travel agent booked. She put us on the next flight 2.5 hours later. That flight was nearly full and we were not able to sit next to each other. Also, I had paid for premium seats that we were not able to sit. The customer service agent also refused to refund the extra I paid for the premium seats. To top things off, the new connection flight was 40 minutes late taking off and arriving in Sacramento. I was surprised at how little American Airlines cared about their customers. Apparently you can pay extra for a seat, get bumped from it, not sit in it, and not get your money back. What a scam!"
1982,"  New York to Dallas. The first leg of a return from New York to Sydney via Dallas. The first headache on this trip is getting out of Midtown Manhattan to La Guardia. That was an hour to cover 9 miles. I try and avoid JFK as the run takes two hours. La Guardia is old but functional. Light loads means clearing TSA quickly and into the small but fine Admirals Lounge. New aircraft, great IFE and early arrivals meant hassle free travel. Sure you have to bring your own food but that's the way it is. AA has its critics and I am not one of them based on this and the recent trans US travel."
1983,  It has been 15 years since I have flown American Airlines due to every flight being delayed. Today is no different! Flew from Washington Reagan to Detroit. It is great to have choices because I will never fly American again and will encourage others not to. Looking at the display right now and four flights are delayed - ridiculous!
1984," American Airlines is by far the I have ever flown. Every single person I came in contact with today for my flight from New York JFK to San Jose was so incredibly rude. First was the man who curbside checked my bags, who talked to me like a complete idiot and then demanded he get a tip before he even began to check my bags. Now I am sitting at my gate where the rude gate attendants asked for people to check bags. As I go up to do so, they rudely asked what I was doing up there then I told them I would like to check a bag to help and (again with all this attitude) asked what seat I was in, I proceeded to tell her, then she barks at me telling me that's not my seat number asks for my last name, and then repeats to raise her voice and tell me that's not my seat number and I need to go sit down. I am fuming right now. I will never ever again fly with American Airlines. I have never been treated this poorly before by so many employees. American Airlines you are a disappointment."
1985,  Fly American Airlines from Dallas every week to Chicago and back to Dallas every week and have not or arrived on time. Frequent flyer miles - still can't retrieve them and get the run around all the time. Don't know why anyone would rely on them. I'm canceling my next month of travel! 
1986,"  Flew American Airlines from Salt Lake City to Chicago. After waiting for over thirty minutes after our flight was supposed to take off we found out that there was no crew for our flight. They then said that they were working on finding one. After two and a half hours they decided that our flight was then cancelled. We then had to wait to rebook and dealt with a very incompetent front desk lady. After it took her 45 minutes to rebook us we had to find a hotel, the airline didn't even offer to pay for it even though it was their fault our flight was cancelled. After a short night in a hotel we had to go back to the airport to catch our new flight. We had been told that we would all be sitting next to each other and that there wouldn't be any delays in our flights. We were mistaken. Once we landed in Phoenix we waited three hours before we even boarded our plane, this was after they did a last minute gate change. Even after we had to wait three hours for our flight, we had to sit on a hot plane for an hour and a half before it even took off. We had been told we would land in Chicago by 2 pm. We didn't arrive until 5.30pm. With myself being pregnant all of these changes, delays, and cancelations were very hard on my body. Not only did we have to pay for a hotel but we had to pay for an extra day on our long term parking. When I emailed this airline, they apologized and said that there wasn't anything they do with cancellations or delays. My husband and I have flown a lot. This was our first flight with American Airlines and it was terrible. Go with another airline when you find your self booking. "
1987,"  Miami to Nashville. My husband and I were returning home from our wedding/ Honeymoon in St. Lucia on Flight AA4658 from Miami to Nashville and I was carrying my very expensive wedding dress on the plane. I had called ahead to make sure that it wouldn't be a problem to hang it up before we left and was told that the flight attendant would help us find a place for my dress. We had been on four flights and on all of our flights except the last the flight attendants were helpful and polite. Our last flight was an absolute nightmare and everyone with us is very displeased with how poorly we were treated. The flight attendant introduced herself and she was extremely rude and condescending. Entering the plane we encountered the FA and asked if there was a place we could hang my wedding dress? She in return asked where we were seating, so we told her seats 12A and 12C. She curtly told us that because we were not flying first class she could not help us and we would have to put the dress in one of the overhead compartments. I was appalled by how dismissive she was. We quietly took our seats but I absolutely refused to shove my expensive dress above with all the other luggage, so we held the dress in our laps. Another flight attendant from the back came to greet us and was very sweet. She asked about the dress and we told her what happened. I told her how upset I was and she told us she would take care of it. A few moments later we saw her call up to the other flight attendant and it look like they were in a very heated altercation. Eventually the other flight attendant placed the dress in a hanging closed, but from that point on the first FA was even more rude than she was when we first entered the plane. Anytime she would walk by us she would make condescending remarks. When we were exiting the plane and asked for the dress she yet again make uncalled for remarks. We reached out to American airlines to complain about her unacceptable way of treating people, but we were only given a very generic cookie cutter response. We don't feel that American Airlines values customers that are not in their programs and we will not fly with them in the future."
1988,"  Montevideo to Miami. Overall a very good experience. Check in nice staff on the ground. Lounge Access at Montevideo. Boarding on time, grups, all well done. Once on board very nice FA. Seat configuration on the Boeing 767 it`s very comfortable. Seat with lots of personal space, flat bed, comfy blanket and pillow. Tablet for IFE lots of chices. Food selection ok, and wines very good. The FA were great, and the flight departed just on time, arrived 15 min early at the gate. Great flight."
1989,"  Chicago to London Heathrow. On time departure and arrival in a clean Boeing 787-8. Crew smiling and polite, service was exceptional and the food really good. Extra snacks and many rounds of drinks were provided too. Legroom was ok but since I am a big guy it could be better, but still not an issue. Entertainment system was very good with a wide selection of movies, games, music etc. Overall a great experience.
"
1990,"  Philadelphia to Los Angeles. I have to say I don't think I will fly American ever again if I can help it. My experience today going back to Los Angeles was less than ideal. I was supposed to arrive back to L.A. on June 4th by 8pm PT because my flight was scheduled to leave 5:51pm ET. They delayed the flight 10 times before they canceled and changed the gate once which was just after midnight. So I waited seven hours just for them to keep delaying and to cancel. Guess what the reason was? The flight attendant was missing. They put me on another flight that was to leave out at 9:20 the next morning. That following morning we had a gate change and two delays but not by too many minutes. We did arrive on schedule to L.A. but guess what? My bag was kept on the original flight that was cancelled so my bag arrived to L.A before I did. I waited about an hour waiting on my bag at baggage claim thinking that they had it on the flight that I arrived on. I finally went to the back looking around to get answers as to why it was taking my bag so long. I looked at some bags they had positioned at the desk and guess what? One of those bags was mine. I could have saved an hour of time. They are horrible communicators. Very disappointed in my travel experience. The only good things that came out of this was that I arrived home safely, and they put me in a hotel for the night. Do better American Airlines."
1991, Time and time again I have problems with American Airlines. This time my flights from Columbus to Montreal via Charlotte was delayed causing me to miss my connection flight and the only thing they can do is to rebook me the next day and add a second connection. I flew with them back in December 2016 and I once again missed my connection flight due to mechanical problems that delayed us 2h. Never has American compensated me. They don't offer to rebook on another company either. They offer the best flight hours in my case but don't respect them. I have never been on time when flying with them.
1992,"  Tokyo Haneda to Los Angeles. Bad food, bad service, always delayed. Not worth the money. I'd rather take asian airlines for international flights.  Not worth your money. Again not even comfortable. Never for a more than 5 hour flight."
1993,"  Miami to Los Angeles. Excellent, fresh new plane (the flagship aircraft for AA). Was able to snag a biz class seat by requesting an upgrade about 2-3 months in advance. 15J is right near the window with reasonable privacy. Fully lie-flat seat with a mirror and an amenity kit. A huge plus were the Bose noise-cancelling headphones. The pillow was okay, blanket was great. The meal service was excellent - salad to start with warm nuts, great wine choices (I sampled the two whites) and a sea bass entree with pesto rice and carrots. The signature hot fudge sundae followed. The service was polite without being spectacular. I was able to take a nap just before we landed into LA (beautiful sunset landing). One of the few negatives: my laptop charger could not charge in the socket (perhaps due to its bulky size)."
1994," Don't fly American Airlines if you can avoid it, their customer service and communication terrible. For that reason I had not flown AA for years, however I decided to use them this time (Atlanta to Los Angeles via Dallas) and nothing has changed. Don't say I didn't warn you. Best airline is Southwest for domestic flights. They are efficient, their customer service is excellent and they don't charge change fees and bags fly free. I hate to be parked in a plane on runaway for an hour twice in one day."
1995,"  Salt Lake City to Dallas Ft Worth. You would be better off walking to your destination. American Airlines is a complete joke and they prove this time and time again. Last night our flight was cancelled due to the crew needing to be ""off"" on time. They would not help us to get on any other flights last night. So we had to leave go home and come back today. Then to top it all off we get there today and they move our flight from 7:45 to 11 because the crew ""needs more rest"" - what about all of their customers who have been back and forth due to their lack of planning! Well on top of that they just moved us again to 12:45. No one will help us all they say is its out of their control. We have now been at the airport for a solid 24 hours, missed our grand daughters graduation, now spending my birthday at the airport. Not to mention we have a non refundable hotel and car rental waiting on us. "
1996,"  Miami to New York JFK. My experience with the American Airlines flight AA1048 (1 June 2017) was by far the worst experience I have had with any airline. Flight AA1048 was delayed over 4 hours (scheduled departure time was supposedly 3:30pm from Miami and arriving at JFK at 6:30pm), which resulted to my boyfriend and I not making our connecting flight to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. We ended up departing Miami airport at 7:30pm and arriving at JFK at 10:10pm at terminal 8. Our flight back home was scheduled to depart at 10:45pm at terminal 4 with Etihad Airlines. The staff at American Airlines (both at Miami and the JFK airport) had no concept of urgency, sensitivity or care to its passengers. Gate changes were made without clear announcements (D4 to D23) and passengers were not informed in a timely manner about reasons for the flight delay. Sporadic announcements were made when it was clear that passengers were becoming even more restless and agitated as their patience was being stretched beyond their capacity. One bit of information that was announced was that the plane was ready to leave however, the cabin crew was waiting for one flight attendant who was running late. This was actually ridiculous considering the flight was already late for 3 hours and she was still late.  I do acknowledge that the pilot informed us in a timely manner the reasons for the further and ongoing delay, which was nice. Furthermore, I do also acknowledge his amazing pilot skills steering us through the crazy turbulence and landing the plane in such a smooth and gentle way.  AA staff at JFK were rude, abrupt and showed no courtesy. After the plane landed, my boyfriend and I tried to get off the flight as soon as possible and when we managed to get through to the gate front desk, I spoke to a lady explaining to her that my boyfriend and I had a flight in 45min but she just brushed us off and said that since we didn't book the connecting flight with AA, there's nothing they can do. I asked her if it was possible if she could call the other terminal to notify them that we were on the way and she just said, ""Nope we can't do that and there's no way and that we missed our flight considering the time involved with baggage claim"". We asked her how to get to terminal 4 and what was the fastest way and she just advised ""go up that way and follow the signs"" in her monotone. She provided no equitable solution, not even extended a small kind gesture to appease our frustration as it was clear she did not understand the concept of customer service. "
1997,"  New Orleans to Philadelphia. Let me first say that American has long been my carrier of choice which is evident via my over 300,000 miles logged in the past 5 years (splitting time with Delta and SouthWest too). However, recent changes will be the driving factor for my migration to a new primary carrier. I don't mind the ability to buy premium seating but it has now grown out of control. American now intentionally forces me in a seat that is not my preference just so they can sucker me into paying for my desired position.  The additional requirements preventing carry on baggage for economy coach, again could be bearable but only if the carrier holds itself to a higher turnaround time (which it does not). I continue to experience delays and issues each time I fly American. Today it was a flight crew delay for 2+ hours followed by an equipment delay of 20 additional minutes. I'm done."
1998,  Memphis to Houston via Dallas. This review is about American Airlines customer service and about the experience I have had with requesting a refund. I made a reservation using a evoucher but I cancelled the reservation within 24 hrs. I requested a refund and I learned that I would have to wait up to 2 weeks to receive it by mail. Two weeks later I check the refund status on AA website and see that a letter has been mailed to me but I never received this letter. Ive called customer service inquiring about this 3 separate times and spent over 3 hours and waiting over 2 months and still not received my refund. So I have to say that American Airlines has the worst refund process. I dont know when I will receive my refund.
1999,"  American Airlines overbooked the flight from St George to Phoenix by 1 passenger. I checked in 35 minutes before the deadline of 30 minutes. I was at the gate before the 15 minute deadline to get my seat assignment since they overbooked. They said that the plane was full and since I was the last one to check in, that they could book me on the next flight which was 5 hours later. I said that if they knew that the flight was overbooked, why didn't they ask for volunteers, I had to go to work. They were very arrogant, and gave me a hard time, in fact I had to beg them to give me another ticket on the next flight. I sent a complaint into American Airlines and all they said was ""sorry, hope your next experience will be better"". No compensation, just excuses. I sent in verification of my arrival on time, but they just ignored it. This is the worst customer service I have had with an airline. In addition, the security told the gate people I was coming since I was handicapped, so they knew in advance but managed to board the plane early and since it was full I was out of luck. This is the most unprofessional airline."
2000,"  Charleston to Indianapolis via Washington. The employees at the Ronald Regan Washington DC airport have no people skills. I missed my connection due to air traffic and was denied any type of voucher. The captain said it was weather related, but when we arrived there was barely any evidence of weather ever having occurred. This airport was the most unpleasant leg of my trip both going and returning. Employees were rude to me at every turn as if I'm supposed to know how these things operate. I was told to ""back up and get out of my face"" after running to a podium to try to connect with said missed flight when I was only verifying that the flight was indeed gone. I was told ""ma'am calm down"" when I came to the gate after being called and asked what I needed to do. I am very laid back and patient, so this was uncalled for. These people are disorganized and undertrained. I will pay the extra money to use a different airline next time since I saved nothing after having to pay for the hotel from my missed flight. "
2001,"  Tokyo Narita to Chicago return. I had apprehensions but prices were lower than Asian carriers with significantly shorter travel time including domestic connection in Japan. Online check in for feeder flights with Japan Airlines not possible, but could change and select seat for longhaul both ways. Window on the way there, legroom rather tight as mentioned in other reviews, but bearable as seats are slim (I am 6'6"" or almost 2m). On the way back, had an aisle seat but a crew member was nice enough to let me sit on 18K/L which were both unoccupied. While most crew members just did the bare necessary, service was overall fine, and especially on the way back some of the crew were genuinely friendly and seemed to enjoy their work, especially the more senior crew members, contrary to what I expected from other reviews. Food was alright (except for horrible, cold, way too salty mid-flight sandwiches) somewhat better out of NRT, soft drinks, wine, and several beers free. Three drink rounds per meal were plenty. Entertainment system responsive and with good choice, all flights on time. Can't find much fault with AA overall and would fly them again for the right price."
2002,"  Guayaquil to Miami. Horrible experience, the flight was late and we missed our connection. The crew told me that after our delay we would be on time. The agent at the airport was no help. On top of it our meal at the plane was as cheap as it can get, and it was an international flight. I will never fly American Airlines again. I would give a 0 rating if there was the possibility."
2003,"  Denver to Lihue via Los Angeles. Awful company. If you book two tickets, what makes these people think you want to sit 20 aisles apart? In all honesty, please give me a valid response on why this company thinks it is okay to hold such practices? If you want to sit with your spouse, make sure you decide to spend the extra $140 to $200 to get ""select"" seating on a flight that already cost you nearly $1000 a ticket just to get a seat. By the way, seats are stiff, food is junk, in flight entertainment is probably what they spend your money on (for longer 2+ hour flights) and in flight WiFi is a joke. I'll be sure to never fly this company again."
2004,"  San Antonio to Cusco via Dallas / Lima. I experienced a total of 3 flight delays out of 6 flights on our recent vacation. The total delay time was 27 hours. When I arrived in Lima from Dallas I was told my connecting ticket did not exist - I was told my ticket, and the ticket of my wife, that we had paid for, did not exist. I was then directed by Latam airlines (connecting airlines) to an American Airlines office; sadly no one was working at this office at 4 pm. I was then directed to call a local number; no one answered the line. I then used my cell phone to make an hour long international call, costing me 100 dollars (I have the bill) for my flight to be rescheduled for 10 hours later. So, 2 nights later, with about 6 hours total sleep time, my wife and I arrived at our final destination. The trip took 36 hours instead of 12. Of course, this completely changed our plans, cost me money, and caused me to experience a health problem. When I described my travel difficulties to an American Airlines representative, I was told that there were no guidelines that would fulfill my request for a refund. I was told that these types of problems, including forgetting to schedule a connecting flight when the original flight is delayed, are within what is considered normal operating procedures. I was awarded a number of airline miles. I have never experienced this kind of service. I have never written an online review of an airline. And I will never fly this airline again. The photo shows a throng of delayed passengers in Dallas after the first of 3 delays (this one 10 hours) - the airline sent us all to the same two hotels. Because the shuttles only held 11 people, and ran every 45 minutes, it took some passengers 3 hours to get from the Dallas Airport to the Super 8!"
2005,"  Miami to Washington. I was upset to find that I had to check my carry on, last minute! They literally looked at my bag and my girlfriends bag, and slapped a sticker saying ""there is no more cabin area for your luggage"". All the while, there was plenty of space for our two carry on and then some. If you going to own an airline and operate one, you should take in to account how much space and what can be brought on the plane, accordingly. Not when you are walking on to the plane. I didn't have any of my belongings with me and yes I am a female and yes I did not have proper items when needed. This was hands down the worst experience and from such a big corporation."
2006,"  Denver to Buffalo. I'm not one who is usually compelled to write a review but the service I experienced this weekend flying on American Airlines was so horrible that I had to. It all began when I believed I left my debit card at the ticketing counter when I paid to check my bag. After exiting security and returning to the check in area, I approached an attendant and kindly asked him if anyone had turned in a debit card as I had lost mine, the guy doesn't even look up from what he is doing and rudely yells ""did anyone turn in a debit card? No?"" Then looks at me and says ""retrace your steps, it's not my problem."" Finally I get past security and to my gate, we board the plane and begin to take off. A passenger gets sick before we even take off so we return to the gate, completely understandable. After waiting for 30 minutes for them to clean up, we are informed that they need to ""wax the plane down"" which took another 45 minutes. It was at this point that the pilot stated that he informed all AA crew we were delayed so we could get to our connecting flights in Charlotte. 45 minutes into the ""waxing"" we were informed we were returning to the gate yet again due to possible damage to the tail. I needed to get to Buffalo that night due to an important engagement early the next day so I decided to exit the plane and attempt to get on another flight that night. The flight attendant rudely stated overhead that anyone exiting the plane would not be welcome back on if they took off soon. My last straw was booking another flight and due to AA already rebooking my Charlotte flight for the next evening, they were refusing to put me on a flight that left that night so I had to repurchase another ticket with the ""possibility of a refund"" which was eventually denied. Everyone from the checkin counter to the flight attendants and gate staff were awful. I don't even think they know what being polite or a smile is. On top of it, my bags were lost and I received them the day I returned back to Denver. I paid for extra seating and another ticket and they still will not refund me. Never flying this airline again. It blows my mind they can still operate."
2007,"  New York JFK to San Diego. New aircraft with mood lightning and new style of seat, big tv screens and Bose headphones. Only negative was the headrest, which was not well padded. Large movie selection. Excellent preordered food, but very restricted wine selection. Liked especially the ice-cream Sundae. Pilot had been sucked in a huge traffic jam, so arrived about 40 minutes after the plane should have taken off. Additionally evening air traffic delay at JFK, so that the plane departed about 2 hours late. Made up some of this delay, but we arrived nevertheless 40 minutes late. Very strange baggage delivery in San Diego, belt changed three times before they started delivery. in summary a quite good flight and service."
2008,"  I was appalled by the last of service and poor treatment given to me by American Airlines today. I have an extra three hours to wait at the airport and write this review because I was bumped from my connecting flight without any notice or compensation. The first flight was delayed an hour and fifteen minutes due to mechanical issues. Apparaty a bird had crashed into the plane the night before. So rather than have the issue fixed before takeoff, they make an entire plane full of passengers wait on a hot, sticky plane for an hour. Because the plane departed late American Airlines rebooked all passengers with connecting flights. I was one of them, the problem is that my connecting flight was delayed so I made the flight with time to spare. The aircraft didn't even change, the same plane I took on the first flight was also the same plane I would have taken for the second flight. But did American Airlines care? No! They bumped me from the flight I was supposed to be on and gave my seat away. The flight was of course overbooked - as per usual for American Airlines. After being treated rudely by the gate manager I went to customer service to ask for a refund (I knew I wouldn't get it but hey, never hurts to ask) and was told the best he could offer was a $12 meal voucher. Wow. To contest this further I have to send them an email but I am sure I will never be compensated or given an apology. Badly done American, Badly done."
2009,"  New York JFK to Phoenix. My name was misspelled instead of an N had a M, there was not one person capable of fixing the misspelled. I was send to 4 different kiosk, two hours later I was let in with the misspelled name. Now while 9 members of my family are flying to my son's graduation I will be sitting at the airport for 8 hours hoping I could it be there with him. Never in my life will fly American."
2010,"  Barcelona to New York. Truly disappointed. We paid big bucks for this international flight. We had issues on our way to Barcelona with British Airways and back with American. Both times we were greeted with customer service that was quite awful. There were a few friendly faces, but what affected me most was the check-in lady who literally yelled at me and the people in front of us in line and then a flight attendant who also yelled at me about food on the flight, because I had my headphones in and missed her when she first spoke. When I removed my earbud and said sorry, she then proceeded to refuse me service. I come from hospitality and I know it's a tough job...but I also know you stay positive no matter what. I can honestly say I'll never book American again - if I'm almost to tears twice because of people due to flying then I will say that is enough. Goodbye American."
2011,"  American keeps getting progressively worse with each trip of mine! After the horror ripped baggage and damaged articles experience the previous trip I regret giving American Airlines another chance. After 2-3 months of explaining and convincing I finally was offered some compensation. The only reason I decided to take America again because of the $100 gift card they offered. Last week, I relocated completely from NY to TX. I literally moved my entire house from one coast to the other, and without any consideration to that AA charged me $100 for 3 pounds extra. Yes you heard it right, $100 for 3 pounds! The guy at the counter apparently had no power to let ""3 pounds"" in a check in bag go or make any exceptions and I contact customer care to take care of this later on, but all I get is a couple of copy-pasted auto replies from customer service and then they disappear completely. Maybe AA uses the strategy of ""let the customer lose patience waiting for our reply"". That way the case dies a natural death! No consideration to customer satisfaction whatsoever."
2012,"  Chicago to Boston. Short-changed on a paid upgrade. This was a late evening flight that got delayed by half an hour (and for the first time on American I heard the pilot actually acknowledge and apologize). Security at O'Hare was a bit of a zoo and most food outlets were shutting down as I got through. Since I have status and the cost would be $80 I paid for two 500 mile upgrade vouchers in the hope of getting bumped. My seat was already in main cabin extra with reasonable legroom, and I fly this route at least monthly but given the late hour and my hunger I thought I would enjoy an upgrade. The product was very disappointing and not worth $80. We were offered nuts which I can't eat due to an allergy. I was given a snack pack as an alternative. I was in seat 3E, legroom wasn't amazing. Seat comfort was ok but nothing special. I had a couple of drinks. Food and beverage value maybe $35 for a snack pack and a couple of whiskies (but they often comp your second if you buy two in economy so not that good). Slightly better seat but not much better than main cabin extra. No meal, no entertainment. Wifi is paid for either way and I never use it. I really feel ripped off, the upgrade really isn't worth the difference."
2013,"  Palm Springs to Boston via Phoenix with American Airlines and American Eagle. This airline assumes no responsibility for the services that it sells to their customers. Three of us left Palm Springs (flight AA3076) on a beautiful day with hopes of connecting to our flight in Phoenix that was to bring us back to Boston (flight AA2341). Upon arrival to Phoenix our flight was running late, the flight attendant was aware of 2 groups of people with tight connections and all they did was to tell the plane to let those with tight connections to get off 1st and both groups were in the back of the airplane. We know how that worked out, we all got off last. They did not call the tower to say we were running late as reported to me by the person at the gate for Boston. There was only 30 minutes between reported landing time in Phoenix and lift off time to Boston if the 1st flight arrived on time. The gates were over 1/2 mile apart. I was the youngest in our group of three turning 65 this year and the oldest was 82. This information is all known by the airline upon booking a ticket on line. I ran to the gate for flight AA2341 and was told the doors were closed and are always closed 15 minutes before take off. I asked if she could call to see if the doors could be opened and she refused. The plane did not disconnect from gate for at least 6 more minutes. How is an 82 year old man suppose to walk 1/2 + miles to a connecting flight when seated in the back of the plane which takes 6-10 minutes to get out of allowing only 5-9 minutes of walking time (if it lands on time and it did not)? At the service desk rule 240 was not applied which entitles us to the first flight to Boston on any airline not just American which we were forced to do getting us home an entire day late. I emailed to customer relations who responded in a way that was unacceptable (basically saying sorry but there is nothing that can be done). I asked her to have a supervisor get back to me and not one response has been sent my way in over 2 weeks. The company needs some hospitality training."
2014,"  Paris to Orlando via Dallas Ft Worth. Front staff members that tooks us from one side to the other without clear instructions to rearrange our delayed flight. It took us an couple of hours to resolve our issue. Rude and unpleasant flight attendants that were not helpful. My worst experience flying has been with American Airlines and I refuse to fly with them again! They keep promoting their credit card and I even thought about getting it but after this horrible experience, AA is a not go option."
2015,"  Minneapolis to San Jose. When I got to the airport I was running late. I was actually too late to check my bags so I went to the front counter to see what my alternatives were. The woman who helped me was amazing. She had said that there was no way to get my bags on the flight so she would have to switch my flights. She worked it out so that I only got into San Jose 9 min later that I would have with my first flight and I was seated in an exit row! People say that the American Airlines staff doesn't care, but that has never been my experience with this airline."
2016,"  Houston to Durango via Dallas Ft Worth. Got delayed with ground crew in Houston today which was not too bad. The pilot tried to make up some time for us, but 5 of us got to our connection gate with plane still there and staff would not let us on. Again not so bad there is a flight leaving at 6 - oh no, now delayed until 9:30 departure and on it's 4th gate change. It's official once again - could have driven in less time. I need a new day."
2017,"  London to Colorado Springs via Dallas. After reading the reviews, before my flight earlier this month, I was concerned to say the least. Dreading my upcoming flight almost. But, after having flown Delta to Colorado Springs in December 2016. I am pleased to be able to say the conditions on AA main cabin were as good as, if not better in one area, as Delta. I can't actually see the justification for bad reviews in main cabin. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. The seat pitch was fine. I would go as far to say I feel like I had more leg room on AA than I did on Delta, but the seat width is noticeably less than other flights I've been on. Thankfully there was a seat between myself and the other passenger in my row, otherwise we would literally be squashed in, banging elbows and almost would be impossible to eat comfortably without encroaching on the space of the person next to you. I was contemplating paying extra for main cabin extra, but from what I saw, I'm glad I didn't. I would save your money as I couldn't see any significant difference in leg room, although it's supposed to provide an additional 6 inches. I wasn't uncomfortable in normal main cabin where I'd see paying extra worthwhile. Food is to be as expected when flying economy, it was acceptable but I've had better presented, tastier food on economy with other airlines. Drink choice was bare minimum acceptable.  Not the best economy experience I've had, but acceptable. Cabin crew service was polite and friendly. Nothing really to comment on over and above what's expected. IFE was actually quite good. Lots of choice with current and classic movie choices. Overall. Not a bad experience. Certainly better than I expected."
2018,"  I was at the gate for my flight from Atlanta but the sign showed a different flight number and there were a lot of people standing around waiting to board. I went to the counter and asked if I was at the right gate, and they said yes, but they couldn't change the sign because the plane that was at that gate wasn't able to pull out. They didn't give much of an explanation, but our aircraft was there, but wasn't able to get to the gate. At no point did they give an announcement to inform the customers. Eventually they re-routed the flight to the next gate and everyone deplaned. I knew I would miss my next flight, so I was able to get a new ticket from another counter prior to departing. When I got to Dallas I went to the customer service counter and despite a line that extended down the airport corridor, there were only 2 attendants present. Surprised me since they knew how many people missed flights with the three aircraft that were late arrivals. Eventually they did get other attendants, but it took 1.5 hours to get to the counter. When I inquired about lodging she informed me that it was due to weather! I couldn't believe it."
2019,"  Denver to Washington via Charlotte. I arrived into Denver on a United Flight. Spent time in the United Club West, then the Delta Club in Term A, as I prefer the Delta Club in Denver vs. the Admirals Club. Some drinks and light snacks then it was time to board. A321 being used for this 2hr 39 min flight to Charlotte, first class was full and economy was about 2/3rds full. Welcomed onboard by the 2 flight attendants servicing first class. A pre departure beverage followed by what turned out to be a 1 hour delay due to a maint issue in the cargo hold. Updates from the cockpit every 10 minutes, additional beverages offered and everyone was allowed to use their phones and the restrooms during the delay. Off the gate 1 hr late, a 15 minute taxi and we were airborne. A round of drinks with American's signature warm nuts were offered, followed by Lunch, with a very tasty appetiser, for the main I choose pasta, with a fresh side salad. Warm Rolls were offered, followed by an excellent Cheese Cake with caramel topping dessert. Drinks continued until decent. A fairly quick arrival and we arrived at the gate only 16 minutes late. Stayed in the Admirals Club in CLT, Term B for 90 minutes then boarded a B738 to DCA. This time in Main Cabin Extra. Good Legroom with a standard economy class seat. Full flight tonight, 59 minutes in the air, a quick, but full beverage service. I was on the ground and at my DCA hotel before our scheduled arrival time. Overall a nice lunch service on the first segment and a quick and professional crew served the economy section, on the second segment. Nice job American Airlines."
2020,"  Los Angeles to Auckland, returning from Sydney in Business Class. Boeing 787 to Auckland and Boeing 777 from Sydney. American long hauls across the Pacific are excellent. Got on the plane in LAX for late evening departure and warmly welcomed. Asked for PJ's and changed before we took off and put mattress pad on the seat. Promptly put the seat back after takeoff and enjoyed seven hours of sleep. Good breakfast and thanked crew for a great flight. Similar experience from Sydney on the 777. Crew were also very good through the whole flight. Meals, wines and movie selections were excellent. Would definitely recommend American on these legs."
2021,"  My flight was cancelled from Hong Kong to LAX. I understand this happens and is often out of control of the airline. However, the organisation at the airport was awful as there is no American Airlines desk in Hong Kong airport so a lot of waiting around with nobody telling us what was going to happen. I had two onward flights to catch, one connecting from LAX-JFK with American Airlines and one the following day with JetBlue. As the delay got pushed back further and further (more than 15hrs) with the first leg, it turned out I was missing both connections. I called up AA and they would offer no compensation for this delay. At this point I had paid a change of flight fee to JetBlue and had paid for a hotel in New York. In the end, after not backing down, they said they would issue me a $300 voucher for use on AA. However, they will only issue the voucher by post. 8 weeks went by, no voucher. I've spoken to them and they told me they cannot give it out electronic vouchers by email because I do not have US address (come on..what year is this?), so I am still waiting. Overall I experienced pretty appalling service."
2022,"  From all the bad reviews I've read here, it seems like AA doesn't really care about it's customers, but I'll write this review anyway. I have just flown from Montreal to Charlotte, and I was mistreated by a flight attendant for no reason. The airplane had already landed and we were waiting our turn to stop at the gate, which was taking a while, I needed to go to the restroom really bad, and since I didn't know how much longer it would take, I decided to get and go. I told the flight attendant in the rear of the airplane that I needed to go really bad, the other flight attendant in the front, who never bothered to ask if I had any health issues that would force me to go even if it wasn't the appropriate time, simply said in the mic for the entire flight to hear, ""we are all going to have to wait here until this person in the restroom returns to his seat."" Is that the best way to handle this?"
2023,"  Orlando to New York JFK. Flying American Airlines is the last option for me, it has to be based in price. This trip reinforced my image of the airline. Staff poor attitude, service is lacking, no food service. It is not a pleasant travel experience, it is more like traveling by bus."
2024,"  The American Airlines staff in the Akron Canton airport were incredibly polite and helpful. My flight with Southwest was delayed which meant I would not catch my connecting flight to Las Vegas. American Airlines was exceptionally courteous, especially about my emotional support dog, who travels with me everywhere. They were happy to greet and pet my dog and she was pleasantly invited into all three flights I had to take home. All other airlines I have flown with were not so pleasant about my dog flying with me. I was met with positivity and an excellent level of customer service from every employee. Thank you so much for easing what would have been a very stressful travel day. I will fly with AA again!"
2025,"  Chattanooga to Orlando via Charlotte. My flight out was ok, delayed a little bit but nothing too bad. Arrived about an hour or so late so wasn't able to get to my hotel until around 2am. On my return flight I arrived a couple hours early and decided to get a drink and some food. About an hour or so before my flight I was notified that my flight was delayed until 9:15pm which meant I would miss my connecting flight. When I went to the ticket counter, there was no rep there. I waiting with another passenger for around 30 min before a rep showed up. When I was finally able to ask her what was going on with my flight she informed me that they had canceled the flight and that it would be leaving the following morning. When I asked her why she said they didn't have enough people to man the flight. I asked her to put me on another flight, but there were no more flights that day. Keep in mind this was around 6pm. When I asked for a refund she said she couldn't do that and looked away from me back at her screen. When I asked how to get a refund she told me in a very sarcastic voice to ""just call American."" At that point I unloaded on her and her horrible customer service and went to Delta and bought another ticket for $171.38. When I called AA to get a refund they told me it would take up to 10 days and that they couldn't tell me what amount would be refunded. I waited 11 days with no refund. When I called back in to AA they said no one had filled the refund. Once again I had to go through the process and wait. I finally go a notice that my refund of $115 was being ""processed"" but could take up to 5 days to complete. When I reached someone in customer service they seemed very unapologetic, like I was a nuisance. I tried to get someone to explain to me why my refund, which should have been $214 because of the seats I purchased, was so low they said, ""that is the amount our refund department issues."" No other explanation was given. I have since canceled my AAdvantage membership and made sure that anyone in my company that flies does not use American or any affiliate. Customer service and customer relations for American is a joke."
2026,  San Francisco to Springfield via Dallas. Do not fly American if you have a choice. I am currently stuck in the Dallas airport because I could not run across airport fast enough. My first flight was 34 minutes late due to its departure from Dallas. We land in Dallas I run ( yes as people made comments about me running). I get to the gate before listed departure but 7 minutes after flight is closed. The funniest part is took me 6 minutes to get from gate to gate but I was 7 minutes late and I couldn't run fast enough? WTF I don't know or have ever seen someone run so fast time went backwards-have you? They didn't hold flight 1 minute for me even though they knew I was there trying to get on flight but running late because of them American not me. Basically flights with connections are just bait to get your money when they don't care about you. Then the 2nd flight is with an American partner (American Eagle) who says there is nothing they can do for me as my reason for missing the flight is not there fault but can get me a discount hotel room for $100 a night and put me on the first flight in the morning. Now I'm stuck in an airport for 12 hours. 
2027, Long Beach to Alexandria via Dallas with American Airlines. Horrible experience. Arrived in Dallas at 2PM plane was supposed to leave at 4PM. Received multiple text messages indicating my plane will leave at 5:37 then 6PM then 6:37 and then 7:20 and then 8:20. When airline rep was confronted about the delay I was told they were waiting for staff. At 7ish we were advised plane was ready. Such a horrible experience I have lost so much money waiting around for this airline to handle business.
2028,"  Miami to San José. Outbound flight on time, but bags were very slow to show on the belt. Return flight left an hour late due to the crew being held up in traffic in SJO. This was a bit surprising as traffic problems in SJO are not exactly difficult to predict, but they did make up lmost of the lost time. Plentty of space and the seat was comfortable, but the food on both sectors was unappetising, particularly breakfast on the return which featured a dried out ham omelette smothered in tomato sauce."
2029,  Flew American Airlines from Miami to Atlanta. When boarding the plane the lady checking my bag said she wanted me to check and see if it would fit and if not I would have to check it. I was able to fit it in and she rudely told me I still had to check it even after me telling her I was going to miss my shuttle from Atlanta to Chattanooga. I also told her I was pregnant and really needed to make the shuttle. I had no trouble on the way there and didn't purchase anything this trip so the bag size did not change. Customer service was absolutely horrible. I've never felt so disrespected while traveling. No wonder they have had such horrible reviews lately. They need to work on their employee training so that customers are treated with respect.
2030,"  New York JFK to Boston. I hadn't flown on an American carrier for over 20 years. My experiences from back then were not among the best to be honest. I even considered to take the train instead. Therefore I had mixed feelings concerning my connecting flight from JFK to Boston during Easter Holiday. I shouldn't have worried at all. The gate was close to the Admiral's Lounge at Terminal 8 and I was able to spot the aircraft while being seated in the so called ""bureau""-section. Boarding started well ahead of the actual departure time and there seemed to be a very light load on this short hop to Boston. I only noticed upon boarding that this aircraft had a three-cabin-configuration and is usually used for transcontinental flights. As a frequent flyer I was assigned a seat in the C-class section. I was able to stretch out and use the interactive map. Doors were closed 15 minutes before departure and there were no delays on the tarmac and runway either. The friendly crew even managed to serve all passengers a softdrink and a cookie. Take notice: This was a 42-minutes-flight only. Arrival into Boston was 20 minutes before schedule and bags were out on the belt 10 minutes later. I will not hesitate to use American Airlines again in the future."
2031," Miami to Toronto with American Airlines. What a terrible experience - all flights on my trip were delayed due to ""maintenenace issues"" which happens all the time with AA because they don't invest and maintain their planes as preventative and only do this when something is wrong causing constant delays. Using the excuse about everyone's safety is laughable. They don't communicate to customers how long the delay will be like other airlines. The company is more interested in paying their shareholders and executives and put customer last. Well this is the very last time I fly American Airlines. I'm done."
2032,"  Miami to Boston. Bought flight a month ago but when we we checking in they overbook the flight. I am travelling with my fiance and now we have to travel separately. First of all, they don't even want to explain to you whats going in? They just say one sec, one sec, and we have been here since 8am and they have been saying one sec, one second, and at 8:50am they decided to give us a seat without letting us know that we have to travel separate. We did not even get chance to grab the food because they dont want to give you information. Not happy about it. Never again flying with American Airlines. "
2033, Very poor on time performance. I have been traveling back and forth from Philadelphia to Boston for last four weeks with American i.e. 8 times. I had my tickets booked in advance and every single time I faced at least a 45 minutes delay. They never leave the gate on time. They should seriously consider keeping upto their times and schedules. It makes people who travel wiTh American looks like fools. Almost all my flights departed well after the arrival time at my destination. No value for money.
2034,"  Flew from Miami to London Heathrow in First Class. The ground staff were very arrogant not helpful at all, nice layout of the first class cabin, staff on board not professional. We need to set up our cabin for the night by ourself no help from the staff they were eating. Entertainment system was not working at all during the full flight no excuses or explanations, lavatories were empty of courtesy products. Food was a disaster . Will never travel again with AA. Avoid if you can."
2035,"  New York to Chicago. Was not looking forward to taking this domestic flight in the US. The reviews seem to be universally poor. This flight was a bit of a non-event for me. The flight departed on time and the crew were polite and seemed happy to be there. The food was truly awful, and the plane was in bad condition, dirty and quite old. No IFE at all. First Class was on par with economy on a domestic Qantas flight. Took ages to get points and SC awarded and then only after queries. "
2036," Portland to Fresno via Los Angeles with American Airlines. I have traveled all over the world on numerous airlines, some cheap, some expensive. AA is the worst hands down in every aspect. Budget airlines in Asia are more competent. This is the last time I will put up with AA's incompetence and terrible customer service. On this trip every single flight has been delayed at the last minute, causing missed connections and an excess of running around the airport from one gate to another while they attempt to get us to where we are going. On board the flights their staff are civil at best and all out rude most of the time, and from my experience this applies to their customer representatives within the airports as well."
2037,"  New York to Sao Paulo return. This was my first time to fly with American Airlines. I found the cabin crew most unfriendly and totally disinterested in any passengers. Both flights were similar in duration ie. just under 10 hours. Cabin crew appeared to want to get the meal out of the way as soon as it was safe to serve. About one and a half hours into both overnight flights all meals were served and cleared. Cabin crew disappeared for the next 6 hours to resurface one and a half hours before landing to serve a snack. There was no cabin crew interaction with fare paying passengers for the majority of both flights. There was no provision of water to keep passengers hydrated for an exceptionally long flight. There were no young staff as part of the cabin crew. I have been told the more mature cabin crew are very obsessive over staffing the long haul routes. What a shame. Pity they lack customer service. Also, I was witness to a male cabin crew member telling a young mother holding a baby to sit down in a not so very nice tone of voice, until they were finished working. I almost felt like saying something as I felt he was very rude and condescending to this young mother. American airlines is far from customer orientated."
2038,"  Los Angeles to Hong Kong. Boarded on time for 0155 departure. Sat in 3J a very private business class seat that has only one window. A large pillow, seat pad and duvet was on the seat. Slippers, a cole haan amenity kit and bottled water was in the side storage area. Pyjamas and predeparture drinks were offered. The dinner service was promptly started after departure. The quality of food was good and the flight attendants were attentive and checked on me throughout asking if I was ok or if I needed anything. Prior to arrival in HKG breakfast was served. Snacks were also available throughout the flight. I was pleasantly surprised with the comfort and service on this flight. My expectations weren't high, but this was every bit as good as my prior business cabin experiences on Qantas, ANA etc"
2039,"  Miami to London Heathrow. My first flight with American Airlines and hopefully my last. The check in agent was reasonably okay. The cabin crew on the whole totally disinterested and disengaged. No cabin crew awareness of good customer service. A poor meal service, and they did not offer water during the transatlantic flight, too much interest in bonding I think."
2040,"  DCA-ORD-DOH-CMB-DOH-PHL-DCA Route. This was an AAdvantage OneWorld international roundtrip award, using American Airlines (AA), Qatar Airways (QR) and SriLankan Airlines (UL). All sectors were above average, and reasonably close to being ""on time"". They connected well, and baggage was transferred with no issues. Check-in at DCA, reconfirm at ORD and check-in at CMB were very good, with CMB being the best, as UL has a separate ""Silk Route"" counter and entrance for business class. Meal service was good on all, and the seats comfortable based on flight length, with the A359, A333 and E75 being the best. Flight attendants were good on all sectors, and were outstanding on QR flights. My BA Executive Club Gold/OneWorld Emerald card gained me access to AA Admiral's Club lounges in DCA and PHL. QR used the AF-KLM Lounge in ORD, QR's own Al Mourjan Lounge in DOH, and the UL Serendib Lounge in CMB. My overall rating for the entire trip is 8/10, broken-down as follows: AA = 7/10, QR = 9/10 and UL = 8/10. I would fly all three OneWorld airlines again, and recommend them based on this trip experience."
2041,"  Sao Paulo to Los Angeles. Haven't flown AA for many years and had read reviews that made it sound bad. Turned out we had a very nice experience. As an Alaska MVP Gold, we got Main Cabin Extra seats- the increase in pitch from 31"" to 35"" made a huge difference during the 12 hour flight. Seats were reasonably comfortable, plane was clean and entertainment system had decent options. Took off at 10:30p (on time) and shortly after, flight attendants came through with drinks and a dinner service. Wine choice was decent and food was as well. Portions were small but for us just right to sit for 12 hours. FA's came through and picked up quickly and cabin lights dimmed for sleep. Flight attendants were very nice, efficient. Had a nice talk with one of them- this route takes more than 20 years seniority with AA but FA's were engaged and helpful. I asked for a head set for the entertainment system and one of them remembered and found one for me. All in all a good experience. Landed at LAX at the American terminal and had a long hike to the International terminal to go through customs. Baggage showed up promptly and in good condition. American did a nice job- certainly up to any of the other US airlines.
"
2042," Las Vegas to Boston via Charlotte. Our flight on Spirit was cancelled. We were booked onto American Airlines (same airline in which we flew in on). The staff were amazing and even made sure my very tall husband had a seat he fit in (we were not charged for upgrade on the way home), they insured we sat together. We had a medical issue with a passenger. The staff handled it wonderfully and professionally. I was amazed by thier calmness! While it wasn't straight through, our layover in Charlotte was awesome. Excellent service."
2043," Austin to Tampa via Dallas with American Airlines. On the finale leg of my trip, I was told I needed to check my bag. The gate attendant asked me to test it in the check bag container and after fitting perfectly (I was on two day business trip) she tells me the bag is too large. I was perplexed and handed them my bag. The two passengers in front of me were carrying larger bags and large computer bags. One was a AA employee, of course they were not asked to check their bag. The traveler behind me acknowledged how strange the interaction was and that my bag was clearly not too large. I am livid as I sit and watch bag after bag roll by me. Now as I land at my home destination instead of walking to my car, I will be sitting at the baggage claim. Classy AA. Ask for volunteers, don't force your paying customers into wasting their time."
2044,"  I will never fly with American Airlines again. I just got back from my annual vacation (Roanoke to Portland) to visit family on the west coast. I have used American Airlines twice now to take this trip, and they completely ruined my vacation both times. Last year, my flight was delayed twice leaving my first airport. This caused me to miss my connecting flight. Then they re-routed me, which added an additional stop, after hours of dealing with rescheduling flights, I got on my flight from Dallas to Portland. Sat on the tarmac for 3 hours then that flight was cancelled. Then I had to wait in line for hours to reschedule yet again. I lost a day and a half of my vacation because of the delays. This year (last week) I was scheduled to fly out at 5:50pm. got to the airport to check in, and my flight had been canceled due to the AC on the plane being broken - they couldn't schedule me for another flight out until the next morning. Also, rescheduling resulted in adding an additional stop to my trip. I missed an entire day of this vacation, and had to cancel reservations as a result. They gave me a $200 voucher. Seriously? I don't even want to fly with them again. what good is a voucher going to do? Disgusting!
"
2045," I just returned form the trip that I took from Saint Louis to Washington Reagan. American Airlines totally ruined the trip. Not only did we not get to DC in time to do anything, the same thing happened on the return flight home. Our flight was delayed and we did not get home until after midnight. We sat at both airports watching American Airlines flights being delayed and canceled. We were not the only ones. I will never fly AA again. Basically anyone was fortunate if they left on time. I was totally shocked. I really almost feel sorry for the gate personnel. It is no wonder that were telling people that “It is just your tough luck”, they have to be ashamed and sick of it themselves. While waiting in St. Louis, the gate personnel did not want to give out meal vouchers. One lady apparently aware that after such a wait that we were entitled to meal vouchers got up and asked for the meal voucher, the gate personnel whispered, “If I give you one I have to give everyone one.” Let me tell you about a similar experience I had with Southwest Airlines recently. The same delay happened and after a couple of hours the gate personnel started playing a game with everyone at the gate. They started giving mileage vouchers for the delay. I have flown for years and I have never had such incompetent, terrible service. The only way I will ever fly AA again would be that it is my only option and I have to use AA."
2046," I was scheduled to fly out on American Airlines on 4/17/2017 at 11:00 am from St. Louis to Washington Reagan. I arrived plenty early (9:00 am). Everything went smooth until I reached the gate to depart. I am now still sitting here waiting for a plane to arrive. It's 2:15 pm. When inquired upon where the plane was at, I was told two different stories - the plane was on its way or another plane was in the hanger and would be coming. None of the employees seem to care that appointments are being missed. No one seems to know anything. I know one thing for sure - I will never fly this airline again."
2047,"  El Paso to Chicago. Due to my claustrophobic issues, this was my first flight since 2010. Arriving from Chicago to El Paso the flight was decent because i had the air vent full blast which helped from feeling anxiety; but returning home was a emotional disaster. I paid $90 for me and my husband for leg room and just to find that the only seats available in the main cabin had a low overhead, the air vent had hardly any pressure, tight seat belts, and I was continually bumped every time stewardess pass. After everyone boarded and a few minutes afterwards, the captain announced there was engine problem and there would be a delay. Immediately I began to panic because I couldn't get the air vent to work. I informed the stewardess several times with tears steaming down my face, that I was freaking out and I needed air, and she informs me that once the plane took off, I would get more air. After waiting 30 long minutes on the runway, the plane finally took off and a guy sitting next row saw the panic and my knees shaking, he attempted to help with the air vent. There were four empty seats in front of me and not once did either cabin staff attempt to accommodate nor ask me why I was crying.  Meantime my husband tried to fix the air vent but to no avail. Also the low overhead was so inconvenient and with me crying, he tried to fan me with a magazine, so I know he was miserable as well.  Next time i will spend the extra $100 bucks or more and fly with another airline."
2048," Philadelphia to Orlando return and will never fly American Airlines again. A horrendous experience! My family and I were taking our first family vacation in 20 years, as there are 9 of us, we booked our flight almost a year in advance to ensure that we would sit together, especially since my 2 year old niece would be coming as well and it was her first time flying. About a month before our trip we were told that all of our seats were changed and none of us could sit together. They had my 2 year old niece sitting in a seat alone. When we called to sort this out we encountered nothing but pure rudeness and constant transfers. After 4 hours (no exaggeration) on the phone trying to just change one seat so my niece wasn't alone, we were told there was nothing we could do and would have to try and change our seat at the airport, mere hours before we were supposed to take off and that nothing was guaranteed. We started out in Philly, flying to Orlando. The entire staff was rude, yelling at passengers as we tried to board the plane telling us that we had to check our carry on bags because there was no space left on the plane. After all the chaos, she was able to sit with her daughter and a nice man switched seats with her husband, so my niece was able to fly with both her parents by her side. Once we got on board there was plenty of room for additional carry ons, some overhead compartments were completely empty. We had a wonderful vacation and then on the flight back home we had the same issue. My entire family was spread throughout the plane and once again my 2 year old niece was booked in a seat alone. The staff on the flight coming home were much nicer and much more accommodating but it wasn't confirmed that my sister would be able to sit with her daughter until literally 1 minute before we boarded. As we were attempting to switch her seats we met several other families that had the same issues as we did. Countless children 7 and younger were seated alone and apart from their families. And AA didn't extend an apology nor an explanation as to why they needed to separate everyone. I will never fly this airline again. I'd much rather give my hard earned money to an airline that would accommodate my family and I. What a terrible experience."
2049,"  The two changes of aircraft to Memphis was not what we originally booked hence a very long tiring travel to holiday. The landing and take offs were excellent. The cabin crew did not look smart and tidy which was very disturbing especially with the females hair looking unruly, long and untidy and serving food. I was an air stewardess in my younger days and since travelled with a number of airlines with their cabin crew being smart and well presented. American Airlines female crew looked scruffy, nor all wearing same uniform. I was sad to see below standard stewardesses who represent the airline. We certainly had a loss of expectation from such a large airline.
"
2050,"  Excellent flight from Miami to New York JFK, everything went off without a hitch, the way it should be. Premium check in was fast and efficient. Flight boarded and left on time. This particular 757 is equipped with lie flat international style seats; they were super comfortable and were easy to use. Pre-flight drink served, dinner pre-ordered of chicken and couscous was ready, it was tasty although the chicken could be a little more tender, warm cookie is already a nice touch. FA was kind and congenial and offered to top up our glasses multiple times. The only disappointment was the flight was only 2 hours and 30 minutes, so I only could enjoy the lie flat bed for about and hour and 15 minutes. American has a great first class product."
2051,"  Chicago to Dallas Ft Worth, my flight departure time was 4:25pm but departed 6 hours later at about 10:30pm.  We arrived the following day after 1200am! Never were we given an apology, or an explanation for the constant gate changes and updated departure times. We waited 4 hours before we boarded, after we finally board waited 1 hour, before we were informed that we had to deplane, and go through that same process again. No apologies, no sorry for your inconveniences - why waste time on apologies when AA aren’t legally entitled to compensation, only a refund of the ticket price you paid. The airline won’t cover any incidental costs either, such as the fare difference of having to book a more expensive flight on another airline or that you’ll now need to spend an extra night in a hotel, etc."
2052," I would like to write about my disappointment with American Airlines service this morning. We are a family of three including 13-year-old child booked a flight from Providence to Washington DC at 6:15 AM. At boarding time, American Airlines staff started offering $500 bonus for volunteers to give up their seats. We did not volunteer, but we were told that we had no seats on the flight. We were rescheduled for a much later flight in the afternoon and offered only $200 bonus. I will never fly American Airlines again."
2053," Dallas to Kansas City. This has been a terrible experience. I have been sitting on this plane in Dallas for 45 minutes. We have not moved. As a passenger, we are sitting here like a group of prisoners. Sun is shining, no excuses for this type of treatment. I will arrive more than an hour late, so my vacation is already off on the wrong foot. I planned everything perfect for my trip involving multiple families, but made one mistake. Relying on American Airlines to actually be effecient and get me to Kansas City on time. Now I have 15 people waiting at KC airport as we sit on a plane in TX."
2054,"  On Tuesday, April 4th 2017, I flew back home with American Airlines to Dallas Fort Worth Airport. My flight was scheduled to depart at 5.50 pm. At around 5.30, when it was time to board, they announced that the flight would be delayed because the First Officer was in Washington D.C. and his flight had not yet departed for LGA. Flight was delayed a half hour, later they came back saying that the plane had still not departed and it probably wouldn't be until much later. At around 7.00 pm, the pilot announced that the First Officer's flight had barely taken off and hopefully we could depart by 8 pm. We finally began boarding at around 7.30 pm and did not depart until almost 8.30 pm. I was supposed to land in DFW at 8.45 pm and did not land until past 11.00 pm. I reached out to AA hoping they could somehow fix this situation since it was not mechanical, operational or due to weather and the most I got was an apology. Unfortunately AA has been declining in punctuality and Customer service. It is no as longer reliable as it used to be. Very disappointing."
2055," Los Angeles to Atlanta with American Airlines. Well, after an hour delay to board and mediocre at best flight attendant service, we've now been sitting on the plane for 2 hours after having already landed because the disorganization of this company to move aircrafts from the terminals. Meanwhile, no food or even water has been offered while sitting here, which at this point and after a 5 hour flight, I would categorize as basic human goodness, let alone customer service. This is without a doubt the last time I will ever fly American Airlines."
2056," Tampa to Denver via Dallas DFW with American Airlines. Flight was delayed 1 hour 20 minutes. Missed a shuttle to the ski resort. Upon arrival waited 1 hour 10 minutes for baggage to arrive at carousel. Missed another shuttle. While waiting, went to AA baggage claim office to inquire about thhe delay and was told by the attending AA representative that: ""I should go complain online because cause it ain't my fault"" Just another example of the great service you get for being loyal to an airline and achieving status. AA has been just terrible the last year."
2057,"  Flew Los Angeles to Las Vegas. Very nice surprise, aircraft very new, good staff and Wi-Fi. Was surprised with the good service, full flight left gate on time. American Airlines made us feel that the flight was about serving the customer. "
2058,"  
Flew from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. The same as the first flight, flight full and left early, the only problem is that on arrival at LAX, the place to park was not ready, so we had to sit on the plane for more than 1 hour and upon arrival to the stand had to go for another ride because it was still not ready. But not American Airlines fault so all ok."
2059,"  I had no choice but to fly American Airlines due to the fact that an organization purchased the ticket for me (otherwise I would have picked any other airline except AA based on prior experiences). Unbelievably rude and dismissive in-flight service: I got up to ask the flight attendant for water in the bathroom/mid-section area. She was bent down and shoveling trays inside a cabinet. There were other passengers standing around her - clearly waiting for her to finish. But not only did she not pay attention to any of us, but when I gently asked if I could just grab the water and pour it myself, she glared and almost shouted at me - ""Can you not see that I'm in the middle of something!"" Then she thrust the bottle into my hands and as I turned away she said, ""Hold up! Where do you think you are going with that bottle of water!"" Another passenger around us took some empty cups and passed to me as we poured each other water and did not want to get in the way of this flight attendant's anger. When it came time for sandwich/food service. This same flight attendant pulled the cart asking people ""sandwich? sandwich?"" When she came to my row (which is not far from the front), I used my most friendly voice to ask her could she tell me what kind of sandwich are were. To my surprise, she gave out a loud and exasperated sigh - turned to ask her colleague about the type of sandwich, turned to me and said, ""it's turkey, turkey!"" Then without asking me whether I wanted it or not - she threw the sandwich down on my tray table. I felt so insulted by this flight attendant. No more American Airlines for me, my family, or friends!"
2060,"❎ Unverified |  My first and last time with American Airlines. Flew from Seattle to Fayetteville, Arkansas via Dallas Ft. Worth. Flight attendants were extremely unhelpful. Plane was 25 minutes late despite having been parked at the gate for 2+ hours prior to take off. Gate agent was late getting to the gate to let crew onto aircraft and get us boarded. 25 minutes late getting into DFW. No connecting flight information was given by flight crew. Our connecting flight boarding passes had the wrong gate listed. When we landed I asked an agent at the gate to call the gate of our connecting flight to let them know, she said she couldn't do that but told us we should hurry. My 75 year old father and I ran through the airport only to have the gate agent at our connecting flight litterally close the door in our face and tell us there was nothing she could do to get us on the plane. The next flight was 2 hours later, which made us late for our meeting. I am most disturbed by the lack of customer service and unhelpful nature of all the employees we encountered."
2061,"  I was on flight to Charlotte from Munich via London. My plane from Munich was already delayed due to weather, so my 1.5hr layover in London for a USA flight was cut down to 40 minutes (in which I needed to change Terminals, go thru security and get to the other side of the airport). My American Airlines flight which left on February 22 at 1:30 pm was already closing, so I had started to run. I finally arrived, out of breath and about to collapse. The gate lady let me quickly run across the hall to purchase a bottle of water before I dehydrate. Finally on the plane. I sat a good 10 minutes in stillness, trying to catch my breath. I wanted to get comfortable and ""set up"" for a transatlantic flight when I noticed that I had lost my cellphone! I ran up to the stewardess and explained my situation. She calmed me well, but explained that I couldnt leave the plane. Another staff came up and inquired what was wrong. I told them I needed to leave and get my phone, thinking I hopefully left it by the gate or the small store across the hall. He walked out and some minutes later returned with my phone. My vacation was saved and I couldn't thank him enough. Both of those flight attendants had done such an awesome job at calming and fixing the whole ordeal. I flew again with AA on my return trip on March 6th to London and they were my attendants again! It was wonderdul to see them again. I will always recommend American Airlines. "
2062,"  American Airlines flight from Milwaukee to Chicago was showing as delayed by 35 minutes upon our arrival to airport. No problem as we had 1 x 2.5 hour layover for a connecting flight. However, time went on and the departure time kept getting extended for no reason given. We were instructed that the flight would still occur. When the flight showed a departure time of 9.51 (almost 2 hours past its original time - and keep in mind the flight is only a 45 minute flight from Milwaukee to Chicago), I went up to find out what was going on. Fortunately a pilot was there and told me that the 1st plane had mechanical issues and then another was sent for and it returned for mechanical issues and that they were looking for another plane. They were talking about getting a bus to send passengers to Chicago. Unfortunately, that would no longer be an option as it would take at least 2 hours to drive, park and get to gate - which means we would be missing our connecting flight. Why didn't someone make that decision sooner - or at least let us know as I could have driven to Chicago or got my own transportation. No communication. When a gate agent finally arrived, she said she could change our flight to get us to our destination, but it was not leaving until 4 pm (we had been at the airport since 6.20 am). So now we had to wait until 4 pm to leave and it was 10 am at that point. We were later given some food vouchers by a ticketing agent as the gate agent seemed to think that this was normal for AA and she agreed with us but there was nothing she could do. When we tried to use the vouchers - which states only good for food and beverages - at Nonna's restaurant, they refused to honor part of it as we had two drinks with our food and they stated that it did not include alcoholic beverages - which it does not state on the voucher anywhere. Again, more issues. We finally arrived at our destination over 7 hours late (which is big in a short 4 day vacation). The experience was terrible all around. So much so that we are looking at cancelling our Citi Advantage card and never flying AA again."
2063,"  My university booked 45 people on a flight from New York JFK to Santiago, Chile, with a layover in Miami. When we arrived at the airport (luckily with plenty of time), the kiosks could not process our confirmation code and many of us got error codes. Customer service slowly and painfully manually checked us all in and took our luggage. When returning from Santiago, we arrived at the airport ready to encounter the same issue. This time, the kiosks once again did not work, but the customer assistance agent would not let us all enter the line to get manually checked in. Instead, they roped off the entrance to the EMPTY line and ""had to talk to the manager first."" We explained that there were 45 people under one reservation code and the kiosks would not check us in, but they were adamant about having each of us wait for the kiosk to give us an error code and then get in line for customer service. I explained that we would all miss our flight if all of us had to wait in line for a kiosk, error code, and then for customer assistance. After ""talking to the manager,"" the agent offered to check half of us in, not that this makes any sense because all 45 of us had a ticket number to board the same plane. Finally, after ignoring the agent and just entering the line, our bus driver came to argue with them as well to let the rest of the group through. The agents denied that 45 could possibly be under one confirmation code and have a group reservation (Why else would 45 people show up at the airport together?). Eventually, they let everyone through, did not find more agents to assist the line, and clearly had not communication amongst themselves. Luckily, everyone got through security in time for the flight, but I'm sure if some of us hadn't just ignored them all together, some would not have. The woman also printed my first boarding pass twice instead of printing my boarding pass for both legs of the trip, thank god the kiosk before security during my layover worked, or I would have missed my connecting flight since there were no attendees at the counter in Miami."
2064,  Boston to New York JFK. A very unprofessional airline. If you don't want to be frustrated dont travel with American Airlines. Today 28 March I boarded on time to go to JFK and at the last minute they announced that the flight is cancelled. No reason. I was suposed to connect to an international flight from JFK but I missed it. They gave me a late flight via LGA instead of JFK. they didn pay for my hotel and worse still they even didn't apologise. 
2065," I experience significant delays on most of my trips with American Airlines, and as a result only fly on it on the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh route where it has a monopoly or if its ticket price is significantly cheaper than the alternatives. Most recently, this airline had a 3-hour delay on the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh route, on which it charges fares comparable to many intercontinental routes, with no concessions and only a curt verbal apology. The airplane itself was in bad condition, with grating squeaking in many of the armrests. I would not fly it on any routes where there is a choice."
2066,"  Miami to Orlando. From the boarding to the customer service and service in general is terrible. The new machines they have to get your boarding passes was not working. Once I rushed out of one American airline flight to get to my connecting flight was delayed by 3 hours mind you I'm trying to rush to not miss it. I arrive to the gate they say they are delayed because the staff is overworked and they are waiting on new staff, which to me is ridiculous and makes no sense. Once almost 4 hours passed they call us to board the plane, a rude lady was giving everyone attitude and was upset for whatever reason and did not want to answer questions. So now at this moment we are on the airplane waiting to depart and waiting on the runway for 30 mins - at this point we are delayed by 4.5 hours for a flight that only takes 30 Mins. And to top it off they made a mistake with the number of passengers and paper work so here goes an extra 30 mins. I do not recommend this airline whatsoever. "
2067,"  Miami to Santo Domingo. Every time I fly with American Airlines, i feel there is something that frustrates me. This time, they asked me to check a bag when clearly it could have fit. They wanted to argue with me saying it wouldn't and when I got on the plane there were bags larger then mine. I was just in a smaller plane before and travel all the time with my bag and it always fits in the overhead. Last time I flew with American in January, the plane never showed up and I had to wait in the airport from my original destination for 7 hours. I missed my next flight and american did nothing to help me except for giving me food vouchers that covers nothing in an airport. I had to get a hotel in the airport and spend an extra 145$. I find myself more and more disappointed with American Airlines every time I fly."
2068,"  I had a connecting flight from Miami to London. The boarding had started early and it was underway when I got to the gate. The cabin crew were greeting passengers during boarding. It seemed that the crew were happy to be there and were chatty. flight left the gate 10 minutes early so arrived into London 30 minutes early. The dinner service was quite quick. I had to decline the dessert as I was full from the main course. The breakfast was ok as I had a fruit bowl.
"
2069,"❎ Unverified |  My wife and were traveling to the Falkland islands and for the most part American Airlines had the best itinerary. The outward trip was nice on the 737 to Miami, then things changed. Miami to Santiago on an antiquated interior on a 777, flight staff not even cracking a smile, the worst airline food I ever had. Return journey, same only the food was a little better. Miami to Chicago, this 767 still had ashtrays in the arm rests plus a grubby interior, I did not feel safe on this aircraft. You need to update your fleet and improve the cosmetic maintenance of your aircraft and do something to make your staff happy, great is certainly not where you are headed!"
2070,"  It was a morning flight from Buenos Aires to Miami. There was only one check-in desk for business and first class but it wasn't marked on the screens at all. The staff were nice. The boarding started only 20 min before departure but the passenges were stuck in the jetway for 10 min before getting aboard. Boarding was more or less chaos. Only one of the cabin crew were greeting passenges and the rest of them were just talking to each others. The breakfast was served after take-off and it was quite small for a business class meal. The second meal was a pizza. Ice cream or cake were served between main courses. The seat was good as it's new generation seat for American Airlines business class on B777-300. Not a bad flight but most of the cabin crew just did the minimum. They kept the safety belt signs on for the last 6 hrs with only a few occasions of turbulence.
"
2071,"  Charlotte to Orlando Melbourne. It's so great that on my flight I was seated next to a man that took up his entire seat and half of mine. It's also fun that I physically couldn't put the seat divider between him and myself because he took up two seats and was sitting on top of me the whole flight, while I practically sit in the aisle way. My favorite part though has to be how I paid money to be extremely uncomfortable, to have the flight attendants do nothing, and for customer service to tell me they basically don't care."
2072," Paris to Oklahoma City via Dallas DFW with American Airlines. Like other reviews I've read, they have failed to explain that our flight is delayed till far after the departure time which is frustrating. This is my last flight home and it is delayed about 3 hours. My whole trip I've experienced a snappy crew making rude comments to myself and other customers. Very disappointed."
2073,"  I bought the ticket at 7.45pm for a 8.55 pm flight directly at the airport to fly from New York JFK to Boston. The agent did not mentioned any late departure and a couple of minutes later I saw that the incoming flight from Boston was late, however, it was not until 30 mins later that they announced that the outgoing flight was late. It seems like they were retaining from announcing that the flight was late in order to maximize sales. I have flown American Airlines a couple of times recently and the company is as bad as other American airline companies. They all try to over utilize their planes in order to maximize their profits but the customer experience is becoming so terrible!"
2074,"  In terms of pricing, American Airlines was very good compared to their competitors. The business class and first class connection between Dallas Fort Worth and Orlando then Orlando to Los Angeles on the return was comfortable. All flights and connections were on time. In fact one departed early to avoid a storm in LAX. The long haul transpacific flight offered a lie flat bed but that had a hump just at the small of your back. If you angle it 170, it disappears. Managed quite a number of hours of sleep. Food service and choice was more than adequate and of course the highlight was the sundae for dessert. However for breakfast they ran out of the egg option and had to settle for fruit and granola on both routes. Service was friendly and efficient. Late night snacks are available on demand and was good. The Bose noise reduction earphones were really effective, but the disposable ear-pieces on the short haul flights were not worth using. I have already booked another flight with AA in April from JFK to Lima Peru. Lets hope they keep it up.

"
2075,"  St. Louis to Chicago. I’m completely devastated. My husband and I have been married for three years, but we never had a honeymoon. So we saved up our money to decide where we would go within the next five years. He had to have major surgery, so we scheduled for this year. He’s never flown before and was excited and anxious. We made a reservation with Carnival Cruise to coincide with our anniversary but before his surgery, because life is short. Everything was fine as we filled up our Expedition for the two hour drive to Lambert Airport. We found parking and got on the park shuttle. I knew a little bit from prior experience, but my husband was worried and nervous. The first thing out of place I noticed was when we were at the gate waiting to board. The captain and crew got on about ten minutes before we were called to board. There was a request for anyone with a carryon with wheels to check them at the desk due to a full plane. As we boarded I noticed the captain laughing and holding a conversation with two flight attendants already aboard. Then the problems started. It took a while because the flight attendants were trying to find space overhead for everyone’s carry-ons (we didn’t have any.) The captain taxied off, then stopped. He told us we had to wait awhile for the plane to be de-iced. (That took 50 minutes.)  He taxied again and went around three times. Finally, he told us that his compass wasn’t aligned and he needed to have maintenance take a look at it. But, there was no gate available, so we would have to wait until one opened for him to dock. (That took another 30 minutes.) During this wait, one of the female flight attendants told us to call or go online to rebook if we had connecting flights out of Chicago. I called immediately and was told by a representative she could not rebook us while we were still on the plane. I explained that we needed to catch our connecting flight from Chicago at 8:30am and if we missed it we would miss our cruise. Absolutely no sympathy given. Finally we docked. After 30 more minutes of uncertainty, the captain told us the plane is being put out of service. I called the cruise line for help to get to our port in Miami, while my husband called American Airlines to see what can be done. We got off the plane and was told little to no info. We asked where our luggage would be and told it would be held until we had another flight. The rep found us another flight, but it would make it there after the cruise had already departed. Mind you, one flight had already boarded and ready to leave at 7:19am. Too bad we were stuck on the tarmac. The cruise line couldn’t find a plane for us because all flights were booked and full. We made several phone calls trying to salvage our delayed honeymoon to no avail. Finally, we accepted defeat and requested a refund and looked for our luggage. This turned into another time consuming ordeal. We drove back home dejected. It was a very quiet two hour drive. We had a million questions and no answers. I called the cruise line as soon as we got home to see if we could book another one. I found one sailing 3/16/17 after working with a remarkable woman. Unfortunately, there were no flights available. I accepted defeat once again and was given options that made it worse. I couldn't add the rest of the letter I sent them both. "
2076,"❎ Unverified |  I have had the worst experience flying American Airlines. My flight was on 3/10/17 from Madison to Chicago with a connecting flight from Chicago to Dayton. My flight from Madison was at 2.56 pm, then it was delayed to 4.30, then to 6 and to 7 and 7.30. After I arrived to Chicago my flight to Dayton was cancelled due to no crew. The person who helped me with rebooking told me that I have an option to buy another ticket. This made me furious, what should I buy another ticked for a cancelled flight? He rebooked a flight from Chicago to Philadelphia and from Philadelphia to Dayton. He gave me a voucher for food which was not enough and had to pay extra money out of my pocket. The hotel was in Schaumburg and had to take a taxi back to the airport at 2.30 am as the shuttle did not start until 6 am. It cost me $75 for the taxi. I will never fly with American Airlines. It was a nightmare experience."
2077," Cincinnati to Atlanta. I have to say, I haven't flown American Airlines in over 20 years. I found a great ticket price and thought the drive to Cincinatti was worth the hundred dollars I saved however, the experience is one I will never forget. The best I can say is you get what you pay for. Although the inflight service was excellent in the old planes and the flight attendants were warm and grand, the check-in counter people are subpar and definitely not worth the hassle of traveling with the company. I have chosen to just pay the extra dollars, plan ahead of time, and never fly with American Airlines again. The online response team gets back to you quickly with a response. However, the experience of the check-in counter people is amazing to me. They are slow. Which in my observation is not a ticket counter issue but a archaic technology issue. For sure you need to get to the airport 1.5 hours early because simply checking in takes 15-20 minutes per person. I didn't see anyone come to the front and get thru their process swiftly. As management chooses to assist who they want to assist with great customer service, I can truly say you should choose a different company if you want quality."
2078,"  All perfect, flew American Airlines for work on a Tuesday to San Francisco, then to Los Angeles and then back to NYC. All flights on time. Check in at the airport was very easy all 3 times. Boarding by new group system, very organized. On board the A321 you get a personal IFE, lots of movies, all for free. No food provided, just for purchase. Drinks offered up to 3 times during a 6hr flight. FA very nice. Cabin feels very comfortable for economy. Bags fast on belt after arrival."
2079,"  Flew American Airlines from Denver to Liberia via Miami. I had eight people on a flight for my wedding to Costa Rica through Miami. They boarded the plane 15 minutes early (of course we were delayed taking off for 45 minutes) so when we arrived at the designated boarding time the agent informs us our carry on bags will have to be checked. When I say that's fine but ask if anything can be done about the wedding dress she immediately becomes rude saying we should have been there on time. Apparently we should have known they were boarding early. She demands the boarding passes if we want to make the flight at all. As I am trying to get all 8 separated from the connecting flight boarding passes she threatens to keep me off the plane ""if I throw one more boarding pass at her"". I was sliding them off the stack of paper I was holding onto the counter. None touched her or even went to the edge. She comes around the counter to tag our bags telling me I would have had to check mine anyway. I responded that I've never had any problem with it as a carry on in 5 years with numerous airlines. She pointed to the expander zippers being opened as her rationale. I took the boarding passes from her and she said that she could keep me off the plane until I cooled down and that she was going to tell the pilot about me. I did not raise my voice, curse, or even argue at any point throughout this encounter. I said nothing and boarded the flight as I needed to get to my wedding. Once onboard there were at least 5 overhead compartments with room for the dress. Begging the flight attendants did absolutely nothing and they closed the half full compartments. After talking to several other people apparently we were no the only people treated poorly by the desk agent. However, repeated attempts to file a complaint with American have resulted in nothing more than a complete brush off."
2080,  Flight from New York to Phoenix was more than an hour late due to technical problems and I missed my connecting flight to Ontario. They rebooked me and made me wait for more than 6 hours here in Phoenix. Left to wonder why the airline maintenance in New York didn't recognize the problem ahead of time and why they noticed this just a few minutes before the actual departure when the plane had been parked there for a while. This caused 6 hours of chaos. First and last time with this airline.
2081,"  The worst customer service from American Airlines flying from New Orleans to Dallas. These people have no respect for the passengers. There is no one to talk to. They checked in my husband's and my carry-on bags at the gate due to the limited space in the cabin (even though each of us had one personal item and small carry on) they promised that they would return us the baggage in Dallas as we had to stay over night because of the connection. We arrived but the baggage wasn't there. They sent us from Terminsl C to Terminal D to receive the baggage. Arriving at the baggage claim area, there was a staff member who wasn't willing to help at all. He was calling some customer service counter where nobody was available pretending that he was doing something. As I was furious, we asked for a supervisor, then he called someone else, again we had to repeat the story. Anyway, after 4 hours of waiting in the airport we received our bag and could finally leave to the hotel to get some rest. In the morning, went back to the airport for the next flight, asked for a supervisor. The lady wasn't even willing to talk to us. She was looking around as we were complaining and stopped us saying you only talk about ""negatives"" I can't do anything about it. There was 3 other people with different problems over there. Awful service! Last time travelling with them."
2082," Las Vegas to Myrtle Beach with American Airlines. I'm very dissatisfied with the wait for boarding and when finally on the plane, the seats are crammed in like a sardine can. It's very disappointing that AA over charges for flights then put us on dated aircraft. It's impossible to be comfortable sitting on top of one another. AA is going up there with Spirit and Frontier of the airlines I won't fly with any longer."
2083," Buenos Aires to Dallas DFW. First flight for me with the new American Airlines business class flat bed. The thing looks great, lots of storage space, great in flight entertainment system and very decent food. Staff was pleasant. It all went a bit downhill when I tried to sleep. The seat is awkward and asymmetrical when flat. It's very hard and really tight in places. In my case, seat 2D, the left armrest goes down while the right is fixed meaning great shoulder space on your left and squuezed in on the right. There is a big pad on the right side of the seatbelt which gets in your way every time you turn over. Also the tray does not stow away which means you bang your knee every time you turn. When lying on your side one side is quite restricted with regards to bending your knee. Altogether these things seriously impact sleep quality and I wonder if they tested them extensively before introducing them."
2084,"  Honolulu to Dallas Ft Worth. I have only positive comments. My rear facing window lie flat seat offered comfort and privacy. The food and drink offered (dinner and continental breakfast) were quite good. The entertainment available was good and varied. The most pleasant surprise was a pleasant, helpful and efficient cabin crew. Hopefully this airline is headed back towards former glory."
2085,"  Auckland to Los Angeles. Horrible Experience. Rude flight attendants, cramped space and very uncomfortable seats. We had more leg room in our much shorter connecting flight from LA to Seattle with Alaska Airlines. Our flight from Auckland to LA was a pitiful excuse for an international flight. I would rather fly 14 hours with Qantas via their connections rather than sit through 12 hour with American Airlines. My husband and I swore off American Airlines before our plane even left the ground. I can't believe this airline is still in business."
2086,"❎ Unverified |  Booked a seat for my mother Columbus to Washington for tomorrow March 4. She could not find her photo ID due to early stages of dementia. Called AA to change her reservation to a week later. Was informed there is a $200 ""reservation change"" charge (Ticket cost only $177). The agent based in of Dallas/Fort Worth was very understanding and extremely helpful when she offered to change the reservation date at no extra charge. In my opinion, she went above and beyond in helping me and I am very grateful. Thank you, American Airlines!"
2087,"  Houston to Puerto Vallarta via Dallas.  This will be the last time I fly on any American Airlines flight. From the moment I was in line at Houston IAH to head to my destination, to my return to Houston, the people that represent AA lacked customer service skills. The officer reviewing passports at IAH was extremely rude and sarcastic to every person that went through her line. She talked down to paying passengers with no provocation from them. She was making it clear to passengers that she had been there since 2:30 am. Perhaps she needs to find another position more suited to her so that she does not take out her displeasure with her work schedule on paying and unsuspecting passengers. On my return flight, my bag did not arrive on the same plane as I had. It was delivered the next day. At home when I opened my suitcase, I noticed that I was missing a bag of clothes.  I called AA lost/missing baggage department and yet again, the agent was rude and lacked customer skills."
2088,"  I purchased a flight from American Airlines from San José SJO to Washington with an 18 hour layover in Dallas, thinking that missing a day of work would be worth the money I saved in ticket prices. We were charged to recheck our luggage in Dallas before being allowed to board our flight to Houston, even though this policy is listed nowhere on the AA website or in any of the emails I received from them, not even in the fine print. We were basically extorted $65 with no alternative option other than to leave our professional equipment behind or lose our seats on the non-refundable flight. This was such a blatant scam, I am honestly appalled that something like this can even happen. Also, good luck ever getting ahold of a human being - we called customer service and they wouldn't even talk to us. We had to express all of our concerns over email. Neither of us or our families will ever fly with American again no matter how much money we will have to pay to any other airlines. "
2089,"  Phoenix to Seattle. On the way out, searched by TSA as American is the only airline to routinely offer its passengers the optional additional screening at the gate. Optional to them, not to us surrounded by a dozen TSA agents. Not greeted by an attendant during boarding. Sat about 45 minutes after landing while they figured out where to park. Then had to wait to board connecting flight for another attendant to show up. On the way back, had to wait in the plane as apparently no one told the ramp operator that we were there. Again, no greeting by attendant. "
2090,"  New York La Guardia to Nashville. The worst customer service experienced. Made me check my carry on bag (that I've never had an issue with in the past) after I had already stood in the security line for 20 minutes. Then once I boarded the flight, we sat on the plane for an hour before take off. I do not understand how this airline is still up and running. I always experience major delays and horrible service."
2091,"  San Diego to Phoenix. We arrive at the airport to check our bags and spending 10 minutes going back in forth between the electronic bag check in and the human attendant we learned that we could no longer catch our flight because of a 45 minute bag check rule. If the attendant would have just helped us we wouldn't have been forced to stay a night and get placed on stand by. To top it off she was rude as hell towards us. They are in customer service, with one job, to serve customers. The next day experience was just as bad from check in to the smug pilot at the gate. Get with it AA or get out.  This was a great reminder why we typically avoid this airline."
2092,"  Flew American Airlines from Chicago to Cancun. No inflight WiFi. No seat back TVs. The usual limited poor selection of food which fortunately we could avoid as managed to grab a quick bite in transit at ORD before boarding. Only redeeming features were the fact that the flight left and arrived early, the plane was not full (seems most American airlines fly the smallest planes possible with maximum capacity. Smart business perhaps but does little for comfort) and one of the FA's was friendly, polite and unusually interested in the passengers. Other than that, it was hard to imagine it was an international flight."
2093,"  Always anxious flying any American airline and lower expectations on every aspect other than safety. Basically, you're on a bus and should expect that level of service. This flight from Seattle to Chicago met expectations although had a redeeming feature in surprise seat back TV's for the 4hr flight to ORD and an exceptionally friendly cabin attendant."
2094,"  Boarding announcements were hard to understand so a bit chaotic. Packed in like sardines. No entertainment. No onboard WiFi. Usual limited poor food options. Fortunately flight was less than 3hrs which was just about bearable. Fortunately arrived on time but then had to experience a nightmare transiting through DFW to a domestic flight. Just glad I don't have to fly for my job very often. On this flight, can not recommend American and have only done so previously based on the fact you have to fly someone. Depressing experience."
2095,"  With the exception of the pitiful food options which we were forced to eat after a disastrous transit through DFW, perhaps the best American Airlines flight I have taken flying from Dallas Fort Worth to Seattle. The plane was rammed as pretty much always but the saving grace was the seat back TV's with quality programming. As a family of 5 we don't have screens each, let alone travel with that many, as much as AA asserts that 90% of passengers do. Also benefitted from a very attentive and friendly FA who went out of her way to get me some milk, as opposed to cream, for my tea. Contrasting experience to 2 years ago on a flight with AA when I was literally scolded for asking that the cream not be put in to the hot water before a tea bag was put in. This was the 4th AA flight and 3 of those included FAs who were very much not part of the normal experience. Food options are seriously challenging for those unable to grab something before the flight. 4 of us opted for the $10 cheese platter which is about the best thing on offer. The other selected an overly loaded virtually inedible turkey and apple croissant sandwich."
2096,"  Albany to San Juan via Philadelphia. I am business owner, and if I ran my business like American Airlines I certainly would not last long. I was going to a business conference - however the company hosting the conference canceled because of the Zika virus outbreak. I called American Airlines, they said I couldn't get a refund, but I could apply this money to a different trip. Fair enough. Forward six month later and apparently they have no record of my credit to put towards another flight. I then go and book my new flight and put a complaint in that I couldn't use my credit. I get a call back and the next day and they now said I could, and that the only way I could apply this partial credit would be to cancel my current flight, wait 14 days for the reimbursement, then call them back to schedule another flight with this credit applied. Seriously, why couldn't you just apply to the flight I already booked that day, instead of having me jump through hoops. No thanks, I travel enough to where I will just pick another airline - don't care about paying more, its the principle of the matter. Goodbye American Airlines, you are not the only option."
2097,"  Phoenix to Dallas Ft Worth. Great service from flight crew but horrible experience! First plane broke down in DFW, second plane landed late in Phoenix and there was a problem with getting the ramp all the way to the plane so we just hung out on the plane a long time. Flight back wasn't there, booked with a cheap website turns out it booked for March 26 rather than February 26 my bad, but ticket counter staff didn't know to work the computer well even with help. I finally looked up American online and called higher up and got an ok price back home. "
2098,"  Dallas Ft Worth  to Montreal. Worst service ever and gate keepers were rude, non professional. I was close to make it for my original departure 7:30, had arrived prior departure minimum requested, they closed the door right when I had arrived. Even if I had received an email saying it was delayed 7:45! All the staff jumped on me giving me attitude, looked like they wanted me to be punished as if I had done a crime, snapping their finders and moving their heads like we imagine these people when angry. I was left alone and nobody told me what to do at this point leaving me speechless and vulnerable, this was only beginning of a nightmare. A manager of restaurant, not the airline, took care of me. Brought me to Customer service booth were they offered to rebook me next day. I then spent the night at the airport. As I explained to them my concern of beeing left alone for a full 24hr in an airport they said they would accomodate me: they gave me a voucher of a pitty hotel smelling cigarette, 12$us for next 24hrs. I ended up booking a night at Marriott to my own charge and all food until next flight since they give nothing on the planes. When I finally got back home, luggage haven't followed. I'll receive them 2 days after. Never again will I fly with this poor customer service company! "
2099,"  Greenville to Denver via Charlotte. First leg was delayed. Second leg the plane broke down so we couldn't board. They told us they were ""trying to find another plane"". At this point I'm concerned. Told us later they'd had ongoing trouble with first plane, but had only now decided to pull it for maintenance.  While they searched for a plane I chatted with another customer who flies AA several times a month, she informed me it's actually rare when a flight they've sold tickets for is not missing either the plane or the flight crew, and that AA is always understaffed. They finally get us boarded, but we're severely delayed. We arrive at Denver, and find out that another delayed AA flight is parked at our gate and DEN doesn't have a spare gate to give to an airline that can't get any of its flights in and out on time. We end up sitting on the tarmac for 30-45 minutes waiting for the other plane to leave. End up getting off the plane an hour and a half late. They also apparently didn't update the status of the plane on the web, because my ride checked the delay time before coming to get me, and still had to sit around for an hour. Overall terrible service, would not recommend to anyone!"
2100,"❎ Unverified |  Miami to Toronto. Poor service. On the flight from Toronto to Miami we were delayed 2 hours. Then leaving Miami back to Toronto I had a departure time of 12:36 and the ticket said 2:18, I went to the flight desk to question and the women grabbed my ticket out of my hand circled the time and said to me ""what don't you understand we don't have time for you"" extremely rude and dismissive. All around a bad experience and will not be flying with American Airlines again."
2101,"  Greenville to Dallas Fort Worth. I just wanted to give a positive review to the lady who checked my bags. I'm not usually a fan of American Airlines, but her kindness and helpfulness was definitely the highlight of my day. She was able to check my bags when there was an error, and she was very friendly. I wish I could run into more friendly and helpful people like her."
2102,"  Charlotte to Kansas City. American Airlines has typically been a pretty decent choice for me, I've used them a number of times in the last several years. Despite this I had never been made aware of their cancellation policies. My friends and I had a trip planned this May (2017) and as things go we had to change the plan. When I called to have my tickets cancelled, I was made aware I would be refunded nothing, despite booking and cancelling the flights almost 3 months in advance. Thus I spent over 300 dollars for literally nothing. This is outrageous and unethical, and American Airlines must advertise themselves more faithfully. In the future I'm going to be far more wary of AA than I have been so that I'm not burned like this again. Cannot fully recommend them anymore until their booking policies are rendered more appropriately."
2103,"  Dallas to New York. The internal leg of a trip from Sydney to New York via Dallas. A typical grade of airline for mid haul domestic internal flights. On time departure and arrival. No IFE, a bag of pretzels and apple juice. You could buy off the menu. Fortunately slept most of the way having come off the Sydney Dallas Qantas flight. American Airlines was at best very average and more akin to a low cost carrier but it gets you there."
2104,"  New York to Los Angeles connecting onto Qantas flight to Sydney. When American Airlines get it right then they do get it right bar one thing. The A321 is a superb aircraft. Economy class seating was comfortable, IFE great and the FA's were very friendly. On time. The problem - AA offer you pretzels and as much free water and juice as you want. Otherwise everything is paid for. Now on a JFK-LAX flight around 5 hours that is strange.  A small gripe and next time I will bring onboard my own food. Otherwise a great experience overall."
2105,"❎ Unverified |  Eagle County to New York JFK. Flight 1163 scheduled departure 21 February at 9am. In airport overnight. Ready for takeoff and detected defect in an anti skid device. Despite availability of three major airports within 1 hr, we had to wait for a part to be sent from LAX. Incomplete part arrived at 1pm. Flight plan changed to 8:45 pm on a return on a flight pending from JFK to EGE. Notices in airport and by American Airlines APP notice continuously inconsistent resulting in inability to select an option. Of course we had plans for next two days destroyed. Systems and management completely incompetent and apathetic. One wonders why a checkout and debriefing are not done when plane arrives rather that just before takeoff. Ignorance is bliss. This type of management is not exemplary."
2106,"  Punta Cana to Sacramento. At first I was going to give a really bad review because our flight from Sacramento to Miami had the absolute worst service ever, the flight attendants were rude, ignored you etc. But we are returning from Punta Cana with a layover in Charlotte and that was such good service. Everyone was nice and made sure you enjoyed your flight. So all I can say is it's hit or miss - they aren't all bad. I wish I knew the names of the flight attendants but if your flying from Punta Cana and stop in Charlotte they have excellent service. So I will give them a 5/10"
2107,"  Unreliable. I was scheduled to fly from Tuscon, AZ with a final destination to Fairbanks, AK. Due to several fight delays, I missed every single one of my connecting flights putting me into my final destination the following day. I explained to the counter and customer service reps that I was active duty, and needed to arrive the same day. There was nothing AA could do. Now I'm flying out on a delayed flight to sit another 3 hrs in an airport that still won't allow me to make my connecting flight to Fairbanks, AK. American Airlines has zero flexibility. Highly disappointed, will be flying Delta for those tight schedules from now on."
2108,"  Denver to London via Chicago. Third long haul and third massive delay on the return. American Airlines is not only budget but also can't ever seem to run on time or manage decent connection. Thank you again for wasting yet another day of mine. Little apology, little solutions and just another disaster. Don't fly with these guys."
2109,"  Philadelphia to Cancun. I had booked a flight with American Airlines and the flight ended being changed to later times. I was on my way to my honeymoon with my wife and we had previously reserved seats for them to be together. After realizing that these time changes were huge inconviences their customer service refused to allow for us to schedule our seats together and insisted we needed to pay a 100$ fee in order to get two seats together. Due to the change, the fact that there were already seats scheduled to be together on the previous flight, and the fact that we were taking their airline to Dublin, Ireland once we got back and they still did not budge proves that they do not care about their customers. For those who are not flying on their business credit card sure seem to be worthless in their corporate eyes. I could not be more disappointed with their customer service department or lack of its existence. This experience has definitely led me to start doing more research on airlines that I travel on. I will not being using this airline in the future due to their lack of empathy for others traveling situations with no care for the customers' concerns in mind."
2110," Flew from New York-JFK to Charlotte with American Airlines. The check-in staff at JFK was friendly and helpful with my overweight baggage. I was even able to check-in my cabin baggage for free at the gate, which made my journey easier and more comfortable. Although the aircraft was spacious, it was slightly old and not in a very good condition. You have a variety of sodas and coffee or tea to choose from for your complimentary drinks which comes with a packet of pretzels. There is no complimentary wi-fi on board, which is disappointing after travelling on airlines like JetBlue. The cabin-crew was well-trained and cordial during the flight. AA staff at JFK was great and managed to get this flight to Charlotte on time."
2111," Flew from Albany to Charlotte with American Airlines. The cabin was clean and spacious. Considering the flight was full, I hope AA considers using larger and more spacious aircrafts on this route. The complimentary F&B included a scarce variety of sodas or coffee and a packet of pretzels, which was disappointing after travelling in some other airlines like JetBlue. There was no complimentary WiFi on board for this flight. The staff at Albany and Charlotte was friendly and professional, giving a nice start and end to the journey. The person at the gate checked-in my cabin baggage for free, which added to my comfort. The boarding was well-organized as well. In a nutshell, the staff at AA is well-trained and the airline has got its tasks well sorted out, which negates unnecessary hassles I have witnessed at other airlines."
2112,  Flew American Airlines from Piedmont Triad Airport to Las Vegas via Charlotte. I was shocked at how the interior of the plane was in such a poor condition. On the top of the seats it looked like they were coming apart and the plane was dirty too. The flights were on time and the staff were acceptable. I fly American because they are the most convenient to use and that is the only reason. I recommended this airline because they are not any different than the other airlines flying in the USA that I have been on.
2113,"❎ Unverified |  I was flying with LATAM from Lima, Peru. When I arrived in New York, American Airlines failed to tell me my flight to Toronto was cancelled. I spent 15 hrs waiting around for another flight, only to find out I was to be at another airport to catch my next flight. I then arrived in Washington,  we boarded the plane, sat there for 30min then they made us go back to the gate because the flight was cancelled. They never updated the board or contacted me to let me know that apparently, to the American Airline customer service that the flight left around 5pm. I was told there were no flights to Toronto till tomorrow, I was never asked if I wanted to be put on standby after spending 24hrs without sleep and staying in airports. At 9pm I saw there was a flight to Toronto asked to be put on it, there were 3 empty seats!  Meanwhile, they booked me for a flight the next day at 2pm. This airline does not about their passengers. LATAM put me up in a hotel for the night because I had no where to go."
2114,"  Given the many negative reviews about American Airlines, I was dreading the journey from New Orleans to JFK via Charlotte, especially because only hours before the departure time, the area had been ravaged by a tornado. In the event, the flight was only 15 minutes late in departing. It was a bumpy flight but the flight attendant came by frequently with a basket of snacks and offers of alcoholic drinks. Connecting in Charlotte required a bit of a walk through crowded concourses and the flight to JFK took off on time and arrived almost 20 minutes before schedule! Again, very friendly service with repeated servings (alas) of the same snacks and drinks. Seats on both flights were comfortable and there was a modern entertainment system on the back of the front seat with a decent selection of shows. I merely followed the travel map tracking the flight. All in all, the flights and the crew belied my apprehensions. It is clear that there is great inconsistency by flights and crew. Could the airline do a better job with training and following their own rules and policies?"
2115,"  I flew from London to Miami via British Airways which was a superb flight. Then I had a connection from Miami to Montevideo using American Airlines. The difference between these 2 experiences was staggering. When I finally cleared imigration in Miami (although I was in transit) which took over 2 hours I went to the business class lounge the staff were pleasant and the lounge not too bad but the food was minimal and not up to business class standard and I was given a voucher for 2 drinks. I use lounges all over the world and this is the first one I have ever used that expected you to pay for your drinks. I don't think American Airlines have any idea what business class passengers expect and I doubt if they care. We then went to the gate although they don't give you any information when you should go. When we arrived at the gate we had our boarding passes that had been issued in London (I was travelling with my brother) I went through fine but they stopped my brother and told him they had changed his seat. I asked the incompetent at the gate why? No apology in any form I was just told it was nothing to do with him and he couldn't do anything. I asked for the purser once on board and these 2 women turned up one was the purser and one was ground crew when we explained that we were not happy that this had happened they again gave no apology and said they it wasn't to do with them and what did they expect me to do throw people out of their seats? (ironic as this is just what they did to us). When we pointed out that there was something wrong with a system that allowed this to happen the purser got defensive and threatened to have us thrown off the aircraft. Just bullying us. All the time this was happening this was stood up in front of all the passengers a very unpleasant experience and dreadful customer service. The plane was tired, narrow seats that when you tried to lie down you felt that you were in a coffin, no built in entertainment centre, I didn't eat dinner but had breakfast which was appalling. All the crew were wearing different clothes so they had no attention to detail and no uniform in the true sense of the word.This is the worst airline I have ever flown. I am now 60 and I have being flying since I was 7. American Airlines do not understand in any way what Business class passengers require.
"
2116,"❎ Unverified |  Philadelphia to San Francisco. My flight was delayed in Philadelphia for an hour, which caused me to missed my connecting flight in San Francisco to Sydney. After contacting American Airlines before touchdown in San Francisco, I was informed that they would put me up in a hotel and my flight would be changed to the next night. When I arrived at the terminal in San Francisco, I went to the American Airline desk and asked who I could talk to about my accommodation due to my missed flight. The first thing the women, who ended up being a supervisor, said to me was ""Well what time is your flight?"" I responded and told her that my flight to Sydney was supposed to depart at 11:25 pm -- her response, ""Well, it's only 10:50"". From there on I was in complete shock, what kind of response is that? I felt as though she was making assumptions about what I knew/ did not know before even asking me my name or flight number. I explained to her that I was already booked on another flight for the next night and for anyone who has flown internationally, as well as ever been to the San Francisco airport, knows it would be impossible for me to have made that flight (I was also already told prior to landing that they would not hold my flight to Sydney and there was nothing they could do except accommodate me). She then proceeded to tell me there was nothing she could do because the delay was due to the weather and not mechanics which sounds ridiculous to me. Not once did she ask me my name, my flight or anything. She was very inconsiderate and made me feel like this problem was my fault and it was not her's to deal with. She handed me a slip with an 800 number that I could call for a hotel. My main issues with the situation above were that from the start there were inconsistencies with their accommodations and what their employees are told. No one should have told me I would have been put up in a hotel if that was untrue. Second, was that this woman could not have cared less about a paying customer.  American Airlines, you could not have put me up in a hotel for ~$100 when I paid over $1000 to fly with you? I hopefully will never have to fly with American Airlines again."
2117,"  Phoenix to Lihue.The personnel working for this company are rude and disorganized The person at the gate even lied about the seat configuration. She stated that the 75.00 upgraded seat did not have more legroom, that we paid extra for the seat to sit closer to the front! Then once on the plane the attendant start allowing bystanders to pick open seats - there were economy seats that should have been used up first. To make matters worse I was still not able to be seated next to my wife. We fly often and it was so bad that I wrote my first negative review."
2118,"❎ Unverified |  After a wonderful 9 days on St John USVI we left our villa and headed for the St. Thomas Airport. The car ferry from St. John to St. Thomas took forever because of local employees wanting to chat rather than work then we hit downtown traffic delays due to a cruise ship docking. We made it to the airport 1 hour 15 minutes prior to our flight departure. Upon arriving at the check in desk we were not allowed to print our boarding passes. There were 4 women working the desk and we were informed we were too late to check in. After explaining our delays beyond our control they still refused our check in. I was referred to a ""supervisor"". After explaining our situation once again, she completely ignored me. I asked repeatedly for her help in at least letting us try to make our flight and I was met with disrespect, dirty looks, angry gestures and nasty comments from all of them. I waited until arriving home to cool down before informing American Airlines of the horrible treatment and the attitude of these employees who clearly did not give a damn about me or anyone else. Their response to me from corporate was to send me a link to their ""check in policy"". This airline is not going to care how you are treated and will not address your concerns in a way to make things right."
2119,  Moline to Tucson via Chicago. I have flown with American before and not had much of an opinion on them until now. I flew with a service dog prospect to Tucson and the staff in the airports and on the plane were all incredible! I couldn't have asked for better service and respect for myself and the dog!
2120,"  Tokyo to Boston via Chicago. I have never complained about an aircraft or airline before this American Airlines trip. I flew out with Japan airlines from Boston to Bangkok with a stop in Tokyo, then back to Tokyo after vacation 3 weeks later. They offered a comfortable aircraft for a long haul, beautiful and attentive staff, and good food. I then took these American Airlines flights. A new Boeing 787 - it was like going on a cross country trip in a subcompact car. I'm 6' tall 215 lbs, I'm a larger man but hardly a giant. The seats were hard and narrow. I had an aisle seat and every time the crew moved past me they hit my (recently surgically repaired) shoulder. I promise I wasn't sticking it out in the aisle. There was no one in the middle seat so my left leg got a break but my right knee (with the seat reclined, which is essential) was jammed into the armrest in front of me. This aircraft with these seats should not be flying 11 hour routes. Not to mention the tired, older staff (maybe they didn't see my shoulder?). Lousy food and service. I'm done with American Airlines and their AA rewards scam. I have flown internationally only a few times but this experience definitely stood out."
2121,"  I am basically aghast at the treatment we received. Travel is difficult for me because of multiple back surgeries so I purchase first-class tickets for long flights. This itinerary was Phoenix to Medellin return via Miami. On the segment from Miami to Medellin there are only two rows of first-class seats. In order to squeeze in another coach row, American put in a divider between first class and coach immediately behind the second row of first class seats. Thus, both on the segment from Miami to Medellin and Medellin to Miami our 1st class purchased seats would not and could not recline. The stewardesses basically begged us to write a letter to American about this. On the tarmac in Miami we heard rumblings about not enough room for the luggage. When we arrived in Medellin, our first class priority tag luggage was not on the plane. Nor was the luggage for at least 20% of the plane. There had not been room in the luggage hold, which I assume means they took on cargo in preference to passengers' luggage who were flying on that plane. Since there is only one flight a day American would not get our luggage to Medellin until 9:30 PM the following night. They would not deliver our luggage to us at night. Thus, in order to catch our internal connection at 5:30 AM the following morning we had to drive approximately one hour each way. We arrived at 9:30 PM and were kept waiting in the hall until 10:30 PM as they would not give us our luggage until all the passengers on the flight just landed had disembarked and claim their luggage. I contacted American Airlines. They never formally accepted responsibility nor took me seriously. The compensation they offered, I assume to get us off their back, was significantly less than you would offer a traveler who was bumped. This is in spite of the fact that we have been very frequent users of American Airlines and had their credit card for over 30 years. This was an amazing experience at alienating loyal customers. Our entire family will not use American in the future if at all humanly possible."
2122,  Flew American Airlines from London Heathrow to New York JFK. Boarding process was smooth and received great service. Food was decent and the in-flight entertainment system was up to date. I sat at the front of the cabin so I had a little extra legroom. No complaints on this particular flight.
2123,"❎ Unverified |  In carefully reviewing my options to return from Mexico City, I specifically chose a flight on American Airlines that would arrive in the evening at 7:07pm, even though the cost of the ticket was $30 more for two reasons: I didn't want to be in the airport at midnight and #2 I felt that this airline was a more reliable airline than the smaller less well-known airline options. On the day of my flight, January 26, 2016 I received a couple of e-mails letting me know that my flight had been delayed, first by approximately an hour and then by 1 1/2 hours. I was advised, however, to arrive at the normal time because the airline was doing everything possible so that the flight would depart at the regularly scheduled time of 4:40pm. When I arrived at the airport, no one was able to find my reservation and I realized that my flight had been cancelled altogether. I had to find an alternate flight. I ended up on an alternate flight with a different airline, arriving in LAX at 11:30pm, exactly what I had attempted to avoid. I ended up paying the higher price without the convenience of decent flying times. Next time I will go for a cheaper, smaller airline. At least if it is postponed or cancelled, I won't be paying the higher price for a benefit that I never receive. I was surprised and disappointed at this unexpected occurrence. I don't have a boarding pass to show for the airline I am reviewing because obviously I ultimately flew on a different airline.  I am basically rating the inconvenience that their last minute change had on my schedule, the cost and the number of hours wasted in the airport looking for a resolution to the problem."
2124, Harrisburg to Colorado Springs via Chicago / Dallas and Denver with American Airlines. Where do I begin? I originally had to switch planes twice but this ended up being 3 times. The plane from Harrisburg to Chicago was tiny and very loud but the flight was short. Internet services are available for a price. The second flight I was sent to the wrong gate and needless to say I missed my flight. I was rebooked and sent to Dallas. Once in Dallas I missed the connecting flight to Colorado Springs so I was left with a decision to stay overnight and pay for a hotel or fly to Denver at a later time. I chose Denver only to be sent to the wrong gate again. Never again
2125,"  I flew from London Heathrow to Chicago Illinois this January 2017. I was pregnant and very tired from the previous flight. My seat was right in the middle of middle row. I was experiencing very bad nausea and vomiting at that time so I asked one of flight attendant to change my seat to the side so I wouldn't have to bother the person sitting next to me to get up over and over again. There were 3 seats empty behind us. I asked her if I could sit there, it was closest to the bathroom too. She said no, even though those are empty seats, you're not allowed to sit there. So pretty much they'd rather leave those empty than give it to a pregnant woman. Nice job American. She told me once everyone was seated, she would find me a side seat closest to the bathroom. I said ok. So I waited and she came back and told me there are two seats available and were closest to the bathroom. I moved there and there was 1 person sitting at the other end. Luckily, he moved with his friend and I got 3 seats to myself. Being tired and fatigued, I pretty much slept throughout the whole flight. I missed the dinner. When I woke up, one of the flight attendant noticed that I was one of the passengers who hadn't eaten, however she did not care to ask if I wanted anything. I got a glass of water and went to sleep again. When I woke up, I went to the bathroom and when I came back I asked the flight attendant if I could have a food tray, she gave me a very rude look and left. She came back after 15 minutes with the tray. I will not recommend or fly with American Airlines again. Our captain made an announcement that the in-flight entertainment system was out so we had no entertainment while flying from London to Chicago which was a 9 hour and 35 minute flight. Their seats were so congested. Comfort level was below 0. So goodbye American Airlines, you will not be missed!"
2126,  Quiet flight with half a full plane from Newark to Chicago with American Airlines. Relaxing journey so not much to criticise. Flight attendants perhaps marginally better than usual but little to do. Relaxed boarding and flight left on time and arrived early. Worse part was the experience at EWR.
2127,  No real complaints flying from Seattle to Chicago and better than a number of other flights with American Airlines. Perhaps I have just become accustomed to indifference on the part of the cabin crew and can now accept it. Power at every seat is a plus and the IFE free offerings were good for the 4hr flight.
2128,  First flight to Newark cancelled due to weather conditions. 3hr delay in ORD. No voucher issued for refreshment. Re-routed to LGA which fortunately didn't make a great deal of difference. Delayed approaching LGA due to winds/traffic. Pilot announced that we would be landing in 10 mins. 30 mins later still in the air bouncing around in cloud and no further announcement which caused some concerns for passengers. Another announcement would have avoided stress.
2129,"  Fairly relaxed boarding procedures and flight from Chicago to Seattle left on time. Fairly full plane. Limited leg room for 4hr journey, seats hard and uncomfortable. Flight attendants did their job but not much more. Liked the fact they enclosed themselves in at the back of a plane by using the FA seat belts to form a barrier."
2130,"❎ Unverified |  Miami to London Heathrow. We paid a lot of extra money for a main cabin extra seat which was not worth the effort as the seats are so narrow your elbows keep touching the other passenger. Also the dining tray is too narrow to balance the tray on as our seat was behind the bulkhead. The two meals we were offered were abysmal, the main was chicken and rice which was covered in some sort of sauce which nobody seemed to eat. A bottle of water was given out with the meal and that was the last we saw of the cabin staff until they brought round breakfast after about 7ish hours. What a disappointment - it was a yoghurt, two packets of some kind of dried crumbs and a flat dry cake type thing. None of this was appetising and was all left except the yoghurt. A warm cup of tea finished the whole thing off."
2131,"  New Orleans to Belize via Dallas. First class? First Priority? American Airlines is the worst airline ever. It took me 4 years to fly with this airline again and yet again they disappoint in every step of the way. I was yelled at when I was checking in my bags and told I could only have 2 check-in free, when clearly online and the kiosk stated I had 3 free for my destination. I am now stuck in my hotel with no clothes because they decided to take both bags off the plane in Dallas where my connecting flight was. I am in Belize for a wedding and no bags as yet. Horrible service on the phone when I called, they also gave me a website for customer relations that doesn't exist. If you want to enjoy your trip, avoid American Airlines."
2132,"  Kahului to Cleveland via Dallas Ft Worth. Terrible experience, stay away! My family and I had our flight home from Maui cancelled due to mechanical error/crew rest. This was only communicated to us after we were at the airport and were given several updates of the flight status. The American Airlines manager falsely secured hotel rooms at a local hotel that had no availability. He issued taxi vouchers to the hotel and when the taxi company found out that he was sending people to the hotel that had no vacancies, they communicated this to rest of the stranded passengers trying to find lodging. The manager would not even come down to baggage claim to address the situation with everyone who was trying to find lodging for the night. I was finally able to find lodging at a nearby Marriott and only due to my platinum status were they able to find me a room. My family and I finally arrived at our hotel at 2am and were exhausted and stressed out to no end. I was able to work with my travel agent and have American Airlines get us on a United flight the next day which was amazing. The American Airlines plane that we flew on from Dallas to Honolulu was very antiquated and did not have screens or USBs compared to the state of the art plane that we flew on with United to Chicago. Upon my return I was instructed to contact American Airlines customer service for reimbursement for our hotel, taxi, meals etc. Some of the AA customer service were very helpful, but the last representative would not allow me to speak with a supervisor or have a supervisor contact me to discuss complete reimbursement for my hotel. She told me that I would have to accept AA's contracted rate for a hotel regardless of my situation and stated that they offered my family $200 vouchers to use on a future AA flight. I told her that vouchers do not compensate me for expenses incurred by a hotel that I was required to secure due to their flight cancellation. All I can say is the cancellation is one thing, how they handled the cancellation is another story and the reimbursement for insult and injury is truly another chapter. Suffice to say for a difference of $300 which is what it would have required to compensate me completely, they have not only lost 4 customers, they have potentially lost many more after I share my experience. Do yourself a favor and use another airline for your travel as I would hate for another family to experience such a terrible ending to an amazing family vacation"
2133,"  Salisbury to Nassau, Bahamas via Philadelphia. I am truly disappointed that despite being at my connecting flight, 10 minutes before the official departure time that I was told that my flight to Nassau had already departed. My tardiness was due to a delay in the previous flight and there seemed to be no communication between agents as to me coming from a delayed flight, despite being told by an agent that I would make my connection to Nassau (which I could have). This experience for me has me questioning to what extent does communication happen between American Airline agents or attendants to ensure that customers or passengers want to further travel with this airline. Again truly disappointed."
2134,"  My son and I were flying from La Guardia to Charlotte on January 20th. I entered the airport and realized I did not have our ID. I was told was it would be okay but we would have to go through additional steps to board flight, which I had no problems with. My son has Mental Retardation and had soiled himself on the way to the airport. He did not understand and what was happening and was given a second search as well. The employees at the second check point were exceptionally rude and condescending. Although one woman who actually searched us that day showed us some kindness. Needless to say I would not recommend any person or animal to fly with this airline."
2135,  Manchester to New York JFK return. I was so disappointed to fly to New York at New Year and discover no seat back tvs. Would have paid extra to go with an airline that has better entertainment for a long flight. Cramped seats and little leg room. We paid extra for extra leg room on return flight and slightly better. Would not fly American Airlines again. Check in a shambles at New York
2136,"  I had not flown American Airlines in years and I was sincerely disappointed and reminded why today. My first flight from Seattle to Dallas landed well enough, but at the terminal we were met with mechanical difficulties getting the walkway gate to connect. The passengers were stuck in the cabin for 30+ minutes and a large number of us missed our connecting flights. We were told to sort amongst ourselves about who had flights coming up sooner than others. Chaos broke out and, meanwhile, a flight attendant nearby was making a personal call to her bank and was of no help in a time of need and couldn't be bothered to be flagged down. My next flight was delayed for weather issues (which I know we can't control-gave an obvious pass here), but was then delayed for yet another mechanical problem (twice in one day AA-really?). Again, I was confined to the cabin for another 60+ minutes total. I have lost faith in both the quality and safety of their aircrafts if they are so prone to problems and in American Airlines ability to act in times of need. I will likely not be flying with this airline again."
2137,"  Myrtle Beach to Boston via Philadelphia. I was on vacation and found out I needed to head home to Canada ASAP just two days before intended departure (mind you, this was New Year's Eve). I looked all over the web looking for tickets with many different airlines and agencies and found nothing but economy tickets at prices typical of first class. American Airlines also were full of ridiculously overpriced last minute seats, that is except for one route through PHL and BOS which were almost fully booked and therefore was a dirt cheap ticket even compared to normal season tickets. I jumped on the opportunity and booked my tickets via PayPal, which made everything much faster and simpler. Upon getting to the airport I realized I needed to buy a tag for my duffle bag in order to get it checked... not the most enticing thing but it was a fast process through the machine and was taken care of within a matter of seconds. Upon boarding, I was not expecting much, granted, this flight was American Eagle and they are not exactly renowned for premium service. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of comfort the seat had, and the flight attendants were in a good mood as well. Complimentary service on the flights were the same, a bag of pretzels and drinks, but who needs more than that on a flight that's 1.5 hrs long? I might also add that having my connecting gate exactly next to my arriving gate in PHL was a very rare and warm surprise. Gate attendants were friendly and cheerful, and seemed to be level with what they were doing. In summary, American is by no means a high-class airline to me, but I guess I was lucky in having been under the care of some really great people and it was well worth the low cost of the ticket. In the future, American will definitely be on my radar if I need a cheap last minute deal fast!"
2138,"  I initially chose American Airlines because it was the cheapest flight available. I had never flown with American Airlines before, but I expected the experience to at least be on par with United Airlines. However, I was quickly turned off by this airline upon entering the aircraft. All of the flight attendants were beyond rude. They were basically yelling at passengers to sit down, and they were condescending about the most routine of things. Besides the horrendous attendants, the plane was so crammed. You can tell that they are trying to cram as many people on the plane as possible with no care for passenger's space or comfort. I had just flown on a Japan Airlines domestic flight, and the American Airline flight cannot compare to the space and comfort of that domestic flight. The only good that came from using American Airlines is that I now know that Japan Airlines will be my go-to carrier from now on."
2139,  Miami to Montreal. I paid 300USD to upgrade to Business class. I just asked the American Airlines receptionist if there was a meal included in the 8.30 pm flight to Montreal. The answer was that the flight is too late to expect to have a meal on board. Also the American lounge was not accessible despite I'm an American Airlines advantage member - what a deception.
2140,"  My trip from Seoul, South Korea to St.Louis, Missouri took a total of 41+ hours. It's usually, at maximum, a 16 hour deal. The ETA for my original itinerary was at the latest 8:30pm Friday night CST. Currently, I'm writing this review with rage at Dallas Fort Worth Airport on Sunday 1:10AM, approx 29 hours later than the initial ETA. And for now, IF all goes well, my final ETA would be Sunday 1pm. That would be 41 hours after the initial ETA. I do understand when it comes to weather issues; in fact, I am grateful that they weren't hesitant to make customer safety first. But the first 24 hour delay of my itinerary was purely the airline's lack of thorough preparation beforehand. Everyone had already boarded on the plane, and halfway into the runway, the plane decided to turn back and redo a checkup. From which they decided to cancel the flight for the night and try again 23 hours later. How was it that they detected the problem only right before we were about to set off? And when I was struck with the news after having finally arrived in Dallas that my connecting flight to the final destination got canceled, they were little to not at all sympathetic. I was more disappointed and frustrated by their attitude throughout this whole 41 hour ordeal, not so much by their policies."
2141,"  Phoenix to Orlando via Los Angeles. It was an awful flight. I was 24 hours in the airport and airplane. They are nor responsible. I lost all my first day of 2017 in a very cold, uncomfortable and catastrophic situation. Because of several delays, I missed connection flights two times and had to sleep in the airport. Nobody in the airport was willing to accommodate travelers. I just change my flight by phone."
2142,"  
Flew American Airlines from Houston TX to Stillwater OK. After repeatedly delaying, then cancelling my flight over a five hour period during which I sat at the airport and watched others placed on flights, American was unable to even find a flight to Dallas on their airline. Instead I was told that I had to drive to another airport at my own expense, board a plane on a different airline to get to Oklahoma City, and once in Oklahoma City, pay for a rental car at my own expense so I could drive another hour in below zero Fahrenheit conditions to reach Stillwater, OK. I had specifically bought a ticket from Houston to Stillwater to avoid driving and spent nearly $200 on the rental car. And it took me nearly 12 hours from my arrival at the airport to reach my destination. The only feedback from American after my horrible experience was basically ""sorry, we can't control the weather, so we refuse to compensate you for your time, inconvenience, or rental car."" That's the last time I will ever fly American Airlines.

"
2143,"  I fly American Airlines at least once a month, sometimes several. It has been very rare that the flight is on time with no issues. Often connecting flights are missed because of it. I've had to miss work and completely rearrange schedule countless times. Today my wife was delayed so many times on multiple flights that she could have drove from Texas to Illinois and arrived sooner. It's sad that the American Airlines doesn't take pride in their management nor seem to value their customers. We will be reconsidering our travel in the future and you should too."
2144," Very disappointing long flight to Narita Japan from Dallas Fort Worth. I had bought my tickets 4 weeks prior and had paid to upgrade from/to Japan. Upon arriving at DFW for the return flight, the status of the flight on the American Airlines official website was listed as ""On Time"". Upon checking in at airport, I was moved to economy class and told I would be reimbursed. Attendant at counter told me the flight was late from Miami (original destination) enroute to DFW. I pleaded unsuccessfully with assigned seat. Inside the cabin, the seats were in a two-three-two configuration. I noticed the seats were old and deteriorated. The TV/Entertainment did not work. My overhead light did not work either! Can you imagine? A thirteen hour scheduled flight! Tried to use my iPad but was not able to watch movies either. I read my book, listened to music with my I-Pad. Due to fight being completely full, it was hard to sleep. The food was terrible compared to the flight from Japan to the US. Yes, I was reimbursed, however, I wonder what was the point in pre-paying for premium economy 4 weeks ahead and then ending up with what I was trying to prevent in the first place? Very disappointed. My parents flew the same route two months ago with United Airlines and they loved it. I definitely will try UA next time."
2145," Phoenix to Milwaukee. As a top elite with American Airlines, I know the carrier well. Since its merger with US Airways, the service and perks have continued to substantially deteriorate. Frequent flier miles are now half what they were a year ago for the most elite travelers and even worse for others. I have experienced more delayed and cancelled flights in the last 14 months than I have in the previous 10 years. The ability to redeem frequent flyer miles is absolutely terrible - American should be ashamed. The upgrades to first from coach have been drastically reduced. In almost every way the ""new American Airlines"" is underperforming and certainly substantially worse than US Airways and much much worse than the Old America West Airlines."
2146,"  
First time I have flown with American Airlines as I usually fly United to the US. Flew from London Heathrow to Chicago ORD. Fare was on offer so I flew American Business class to the US and British Airways First Class back to the UK. Checking in - Heathrow airport I arrived at 05.30, the check in desks did not open until 06.00 for an 08.40 flight. I was aware of the desk opening times so waiting was not a problem. There was a dedicated check in desk for business passengers and when I arrived there was only one other couple in front of me. Check in quick and efficient. No problems encountered. As I was flying business class I was informed that I could use the fast track security lane and make use of the American Airlines lounge. Boarding as with all major airlines boarding was the usual, Family's with children, Passengers that require help / more time followed by business class. On boarding I was direct to my seat and once seated asked if I would like a drink, went for Champagne (very nice too). Flight attendants very attentive, refilling my glass when it became empty. Inflight entertainment, for business class passengers on the 767 you are given a Samsung tablet and Bose headphones. Great choice of films & TV on the tablet only minor niggle is that the tablet is taken back about an hour before landing so a bit annoying if you are halfway through a decent film, also I am not sure how passengers who do not use tablets would of managed. Seat - I found the seat comfortable enough, plenty of leg room. As this was a morning flight I did not feel the need to make use of the lie flat feature so I cannot comment. The seat is controlled via a touch panel and it seems a bit sensitive as while resting my arm on the side the seat started to change position, I did this a couple of times until I placed something over the panel to prevent me from altering my seat layout accidently. I was seated in 4A a window seat. Landing luggage was through fairly quickly again no issues were encountered. I will have no problems considering American Airlines again the next time I fly across the Atlantic."
2147,"  I had a flight Miami to London Heathrow via Boston. The check in was an unnecessarily stressful and upsetting experience caused by the unprofessionalism and aggression of American Airlines ground staff. After 30 minutes waiting in line the ground crew member informed those of us waiting there that the five desk staff were finishing their shift and we had to leave the line. Despite protests from my fellow passengers the woman informed us the staff would “up and leave” when their shift was finished. I am sympathetic that their shift was over but surely it would have been more effective to allow those of us waiting to check in or be served by other desk staff. I have never seen staff upping and leaving when there is a long line of people waiting without making sure they were to be attended to. I was then instructed to join the general enquiry line. In this line were people who had missed connections, missed flights, rebooking flights, unable to check in manually, oversized baggage, etc. The staff appeared to be directing people to lines in order to be rid of them and did not allow questions to be finished nor addressing passengers’ issues. Just a simple “go stand in that line”. The complaints from my fellow passengers echoed my own disbelief that at one point less than five desk staff were there to serve the long line of people and there was no coordination of passengers who had little time until boarding. I tried in vain to ask if another check-in option was available - highlighting my fear I would miss my connecting flight to London if I missed the domestic flight - but was continually dismissed. After two hours of waiting I was finally able to check in my luggage and thanks to the security staff allowing me to fast track through security I made the flight. It should not take 2.5 hours to check in one small bag!"
2148,"  Horrible customer service, forced to buy a hotel and get a cab myself after they cancelled a flight at 10 at night in Washington Reagan airport and never given any apologies, just very rude employees. Tried to recharge me for my checked bag even tho they cancelled my flight and left me stranded in Washington Reagan airport at night! So I had to get a hotel for 300 dollars for one night because that's what was available on such short notice and have received nothing from the airport for all this headache and I have missed work. Very disappointing way to end my vacation. I will never fly with American Airlines again!"
2149," I've often heard that American Airlines is bad from reading reviews, but after my most recent trip from San Francisco to Tokyo through Los Angeles and back, I can confidently say that I will not book a flight with AA again, ever. My trip to and fro were full of issues. I chose a morning flight at 7am since the ticket was cheaper, and and got to SFO at 5am, while thinking that I was giving myself ample time before departure. I was badly mistaken. When I got there, I saw a long line of more than 40 people queuing. The American Airlines check-in staff were rude and unsympathetically telling people in the queue who have missed their 6am flight that there's nothing they can't do about it, although the problems were due to their slow service. When checking in using the self check-in kiosk, I had problems scanning my passport, the kiosk asked me to verify my travel documents despite my having an Indonesian passport and traveling to Indonesia, and it ran out of paper to print my luggage tags. Many of the check-in kiosks were unresponsive and no one was there to fix it. IFE was the only decent thing they had, their screens are surprisingly capacitive, which allows much better interaction with your fingers. Inflight cabin attendants were impolite. My return flight wasn't a better experience. Upon arriving at LAX after a 7-hour and 9-hour flight, I was told that my LAX to SFO flight was canceled and of course there's nothing American Airlines can do about it besides rebooking my flight to the next day (which they can't even do automatically), and I didn't like that since I have to get back to work the next day. I had to drive back from LA to SF after my 20 hour trip, while jet-lagged. Seriously, avoid American Airlines like the plague. Also, lesson learned, try to avoid flights that have domestic transits."
2150,"  El Salvador to Toronto via Miami. I will never use American Airlines again, and do not recommend this airline to anyone. I arrived at Toronto Pearson Airport last night on American Airlines. My luggage didn't arrive. I went to baggage services and they gave me a phone number to call the next day. I called this morning and the customer service agent told me that my luggage is still in Miami. They are not sure when it will get here. I have my medication in that luggage and now I have to go out of my way to purchase more. Amercian Airlines doesn't even provide any compensation for these sort of mistakes. You pay so much money to travel on American Airlines and they can't even make sure your luggage arrives with you. I'm very disappointed."
2151,"  My wife and I went to College Station from Richmond on Dec 12, 2016 via American Airlines.  We were scheduled to return to Richmond from College Station via American Airlines on January 6, 2017. We purchased our tickets from Orbitz. When we went to the Amercian Airlines ticket counter on January 6 to get our boarding passes for return flight from College Station on Amerian Airline Flight 2803 leaving at 10:35 AM, the American Airline Agent told us that our return tickets were cancelled by Orbitz perhaps by error and hence she would be unable to give us boarding passes. It was a real surprise to us! The plane was about to leave in less than an hour. I frantically called Orbitz and they expressed apology and tried to fix the problem. The first agent at Orbitz could not solve the problem and then passed the call to his supervisors and after being on the phone for more than two hours, Orbitz finally was able to reinstated our tickets in American Airline System. By the time our scheduled flight left the airport and our connecting flight from Dallas to Richmond got sold out. Orbitz suggested that we buy two new one way tickets for later flight and they would reimburse us. There was no guarantee that we will ever get reimbursed based on verbal commitment by Orbitz. So we got quite concerned. We went back to the AA agent and she understood our dilemma, she watched us talking to Orbitz for two hours to resolve the issue. She went back on her own and talked to her supervisor while I was on the phone with Orbitz. She came back to tell us that she would try to switch our reinstated tickets to a later flight from CLL to RIC via DFW. She worked on her computer for a while and finally managed to put us on a later flight. My wife and I were overwhelmed by the extraordinary help extended to us. We had to return back to Richmond on January 6. Without the agents help we would have been stranded and we are extremely grateful to her for her assistance. She is most gracious and courteous and helpful. We thank her most sincerely. "
2152,"  Flying with American Airlines from Miami to La Guardia, New York has been the most frustrating and disappointing experience I have ever had traveling. The staff are rude and uneducated and they have many staff members who only speak one language (which makes it really difficult to communicate). I arrived late to my flight in Miami because I was on a previous flight that we missed due to bad weather. When I get to Miami I had about an hour to get everything done but with the lack of education and common sense from the staff members at American Airlines I was cut short on time. First off in my previous flight I was given a standby ticket for this flight because we were not going to make it to our original flight. When I get to Miami and tried explaining that to the staff member in bag check in she told me ""keep your mouth shut and give me your ticket"". She then tells me I'm too late to check in my bags so I decide not to go with bags. The women gave me back my stand by ticket instead of boarding pass which did not allow me to go to TSA. I then had to go back in the line to get a boarding pass. Finally got a boarding pass and TSA were excellent and let us go ahead of everyone so we could make the flight. When I get to the gate the ""manager"" told me I was not able to get on board because the doors were closed. It was 8.20 and the flight got delayed to 8.40. If I'm not mistaken you can board up to 10 minutes prior to flying. She refused to let us on and decided that her best customer service skill was to scream at us. An elderly disabled women caused a scene at the gate, and she was allowed to board. I refuse to take another flight with American Airlines. "
2153," I bought my ticket via British Airways and 2 of the 5 sectors were with American Airlines. I had thought since I'd bought a full service ticket all the flights would be with full service airlines and not mixed with a budget airline. I am writing to BA to complain - even though the 3 sectors flying with BA were wonderful. My first flight with AA was Las Vegas to London via Chicago. I had no money on me and my cards were in my hand luggage as I didn't think they were needed. These were put in the hold anyway as there was no space in the lockers, but I did not know AA was a budget airline and the whole ""money, money, money is everything"". I got a ""free"" glass of water and went hungry. I then had a tight connection at ORD so had to get straight to the next gate (it said free soft drink is back with much fanfare, so yes, they must have tried to remove even that). I was pleased to see a new aircraft, but it ended there. The staff were such a mixed bunch, never seen a flight crew like it, it was almost as if they were volunteers. Anyway, they were nice enough, a million miles from a full service airline but reckon they gave all they could with their working conditions. Anyway my whole reason for writing this review is because of the food. Now I could feel the resentment from American Airlines. How dare they have to give free food out. What a shame so much of the transatlantic competitors do. I say free, of course it's in the ticket price but they call it complimentary. So by this point I'm starving and my kosher meal came. It blew my mind. One stale bun, crumbled in my hands. No butter or even spread, you'll have it dry. A side of sour shredded veg. I don't know, it was like coleslaw with no mayo and sat in vinegar for days on end until it wilted. Must have been the cheapest thing the catering firm had, it was beyond vile. Simply not edible. The teeny ""main"" was beyond it as well, little drops of pasta that were so overcooked it liquefied upon contact with tongue and tasted of nothing. Just unbelievable. The BBQ ""chicken"" was highly processed, bland and a perfect partner for the horror of it all. Maybe 5,000 flights, this was the most pathetic assortment of rubbish I'd ever been given. Then there was a tiny square of sponge with jam and coconut. I can't eat coconut but hey, the whole thing was vile. For ""breakfast"" the offering was so ridiculous I kindly asked the attendant to take it back. I had hoped for a full English, but thought I might get a warmed 7 day croissant, but no, it was a stale bun with no butter. The mainstream offering was a bag of dried cranberries which I can't eat, a mixed berry slice of muffin (don't expect a full muffin!). It doesn't sound so horrific, just cheap, but I can't eat dried fruit. I did eat the yogurt which American couldn't mess up. I left the first plane ravenous and the second chewing my knuckles. There were only two drinks served over the 7 hours of course. Paid a full service price and fobbed me off with this. They need to disassociate with that brand immediately."
2154,"  Tampa to San Francisco via Phoenix. Hands down the worst airline experience I have ever had. Almost every agent, flight attendant, and other airline staff were inefficient, disgruntled, or rude.  I would never recommend this airline. On flight out we had a super old plane that was making all kinds of weird/loud noises. We were on the same plane out of Phoenix and they wouldn't take off with the noise so we returned to the gate and sat for over an hour and a half with no information on what was wrong (just the repeated ""technical issue"" update at about 15 mins intervals and no cabin service). The plane was completely powered off at one point which meant no lights/air for a period of time. When we finally made it to Tampa the power also went off as we were trying to de-board. Fast forward to the return flight and after waiting in a super long line, the curbside check-in didn't work and they wouldn't tell us why. Had to wait in another line to check our stroller inside and the agent there was convinced we were traveling to San Francisco, Costa Rica, not CA. Printed off boarding passes for Tampa and Phoenix in a horrible jumble which we were forced to sort ourselves at security with (at this point) screaming children in tow. Barely made the flight and we were at the airport almost 2 hours in advance. In Phoenix we discovered for some reason our boarding passes no longer had priority on them but group two. I had to wait at the counter for at least 15 mins (children now screaming again) while the agent completely ignored me, and when I was finally able to ask if we could board with priority as we had on every other leg I was very rudely interrupted as the agent said repeatedly, ""what's written on your boarding pass, what's written on your boarding pass?"" We were in the back of the plane that leg - with a four-year old and two-year old. Boarding in group 2 was an absolute nightmare and we held up a bunch of other people. We are also (or I should say were as of today) platinum card holders, but because my father booked the trip for us that didn't matter. At least the plane was newer on that leg, but super bare-bones for the age. Couldn't get the in-flight streaming option to work either (they only support for a limited number of browsers). I have never felt compelled to write an airline review before, but given this experience I felt compelled to warn future travelers (especially those with young children) that this is not the airline for you."
2155,"  I flew with my family of 5 on Jan 4 2017 from Miami to Vail, flight 2499 for a skiing trip. We departed on time and about 3.5 hours into a 5 hour flight the pilot announced that American Airlines had made a decision not to land in Vail do to a winter snow storm. Our plane was completely full of people heading for a ski trip. The incredible decision by AA to head back to Miami was crazy. No chance to deviate to Dallas or even Denver that was open. The entire plane was extremely upset on the poor choice and way of communication, with no regards for the huge investment on our vacation. Upon arrival back in Miami the entire plane, about several 100 people weren't assisted in any way by AA. After waiting almost an hour, they advised us to head to gate D37 a rebooking center, a nightmare of several hours that did not help. We ended up on a flight out of Miami to Charllotte that evening to head into Denver the next morning. We lost that night stay at our hotel in Vail, our lift ticket the following day and ski rental. AA gave us zero vouchers, with huge additional costs to my family. We had to pay for hotel in Charlotte and dinner at airport. "
2156,"  I have never flown with a worse carrier. We were scheduled to fly from Bridgetown, Barbados to Boston via Miami on 3 January 2017. Our flight was due to leave at 14:30 from Barbados connecting in Miami, arriving in Miami at 18:30 leaving for Boston at 21:43. That gave me 3:15 minutes to connect. American, as usual was delayed and eventually we didn't leave on time. We arrived in Miami at 20:15 giving us 1:30 to recheck bags and catch the next flight. When we eventually collected our bags we had about 1 hour to get on the next flight. American said to me (and everyone behind me) that we didn't have enough time to check bags so we were forced to stay over in Miami an extra night.  It is unbelievable."
2157,"  Flew American Airlines from Milan to Miami. The Aircraft was very old, dirty and uncomfortable. Seats very small, no video on the front seat, no wifi connections, food very poor, service level very low. There were some functions out of use (e.g. button to call the steward). Really poor experience. The flight back from Miami to Milan was the same and on top of that the audio was out of order. I will never fly American again while they have these old fashioned aircrafts. I spent approx 200$ extra for ""so called"" ""preferred seats"". "
2158,"  First flight to Norfolk from JFK was cancelled. They put me on a flight from LGA to Charlotte to Norfolk that I had to pay money to cab over to get to LGA from JFK. Got to the gate, delayed an hour. Got on that plane after one hour delay. Lands. Gate delay. Stuck in Charlotte on layover. Get to the gate for the plane to Norfolk. Delayed over 2 hours. I'm still sitting in Charlotte waiting for this aircraft to board. It's been 12 hours. I could have driven to North Carolina. Twice. I will never give my money to American Airlines again."
2159,"  Los Angeles to Washington. Husband and I bought full fare first class tickets in March 2016 for this annual holiday flight. Check-in was fine at American Airlines premium check-in, we were given boarding passes for seats 4A and 4B and we headed to the Admirals club. After an hour, we headed to the gate where we were told we were downgraded because they sold 20 first class tickets for 16 seats. Since we bought ours in March, they cost the least, therefore, we were downgraded. Here's a center seat and a $300 voucher, no drink voucher, no systemwide upgrade, but a promise of we'll provide you your drinks and meals onboard. I doubt they will.  Now I'm doubting if I should buy my ticket for lie flat 767 service to HNL through DFW in July knowing that buying it 7 months out makes it cheaper so I'll probably get downgraded again."
2160,"  Tokyo to Mexico City via Los Angeles. The inflight service was terrible; bad food, small servings, irresponsive crews, overcrowded lavatories, smaller aisle. This was all bearable until I reached Los Angeles for my 14 hours layover for my flight to Mexico city. The flight was suppose to depart at 23:55 at first, then delays of 20, 50, 120 minutes was announced until the flight was announced cancelled. Along with 6 other flights in LAX, American Airlines cancelled these flights altogether creating a mayhem in LAX. The airline has a customer service counter with 2 desks, just 2! And any other AA personnel you see in the airport are unwilling to answer any questions and they try to direct you to the service counter. When 7 flights are cancelled at one time, the queues to the counter are long, I mean 7-Hours long in the end. After getting reneged on your contract with AA to fly to your destination, you are forced to wait 7-hours to get an answer. So I did exactly that, and only then I knew it was because they had poor crew scheduling, resulting in insufficient crews to provide those flights. How is that even possible? With poor regulations of airline policies in the US, these airlines and airports are falling way behind with competitions from Middle East and Asia. So at the counter, I asked what do you have for me? The nonchalant service crew wasn't unsympathetic about our situation and just offered a replacement flight 3-days later - 3 days, 72-hours and told me there is nothing else they can do about it. Since I have my activities booked in Mexico city already, i have to pay a last-minute ticket to the city on my own which cost me $600 USD. American Airlines are unwilling to do anything about it and just asked me to collect my ""checked"" luggage which is left somewhere in the airport, without anyone overseeing it. To be honest, I read reviews about AA before buying the flight but did not know it can be this terrible.  To all future travellers contemplating about the savings you get taking American Airlines - don't do it, pay more to get a decent airline."
2161,"  Orlando to Los Angeles. Utterly disappointed in American Airlines service. First the website told us all seats were taken except additional cost seats at $90. They made us check in at airport and stand in a long line of surly employees to be told that there were actually many available seats at no additional cost. Duplicitous and inconvenient. Next we were told no overheard space for carry ons was left and had to check our carry ons and pick them up at baggage claim. Also ridiculous. AA knows exactly how many people and bags they have - they only run out of space by letting people fill overhead bins with jackets etc. Irresponsible. I would try hard never to fly with these unhappy employees nor this third rate airline. On a humanistic note: there was a Spanish speaking woman in line next to us who was repeatedly dismissed and sent to the back of the line because no one would bother to call one of the many bilingual employees to assist her. I am disappointed to have my family vacation begin on this note.
"
2162,"  Miami to Philadelphia. Horrible customer service. After already checking in and going through security, I switched to an earlier flight and was assured by a really nice guy on phone that my bag could be transferred, all I needed to do was speak to an agent here at the airport. Only problem is there wasn't a single agent at any of the desks, including customer service. I finally found an agent behind the Cuba desk and she told me I couldn't switch baggage in domestic flights. So I booked a reservation, paid a fee under the impression by baggage could arrive with me because of contradictory beliefs on a basic, fundamental policy, which should have been explained before I booked my new flight. I called customer service and they said they would not refund me the baggage fee for the inconvenience of coming back to the airport at 1AM to pick up my luggage. She told me to find a different agent and see what could be done. When I found another agent she was on the phone speaking to a friend in Spanish and popping her gum, ignored me for three minutes, then told me to have a seat and be patient for the agent who will arrive in 30 minutes. Outrageously inappropriate. Awful experience. Spent nearly two hours on the phone trying to get answers and running around the airport. Never flying with American again."
2163,"  Before I tell you about my experience, let me preface this by stating, 2 weeks ago, my parents had to spend the night in the terminal at Dallas/Fort Worth. Mind you, my father is not the most patient man the earth has ever seen. It took them more than 24 hours to get from Southern Nebraska to San Antonio. That's ridiculous. First, their plane was late arriving at the airport so they could get on it in the first place. Then their flight from DFW to SAT was cancelled, but the airline staff did not announce that, instead they kept leading everyone on as if the plane would be ready at any minute. Their plane, finally ""ready"" at 0700 the next morning, was fully loaded and ready for take off. Until the crew discovered the brakes weren't working. Back to the gate and off the plane they go. My parents finally arrived in San Antonio that night at 2100 (9pm). When it came time for me to go to Texas for Christmas, one week after the aforementioned fiasco, my experience was better, but then again one cannot fall out of a basement."
2164," Los Angeles to Hong Kong is a new route for American Airlines. Due to head winds the flight was slightly delayed and missed connecting flight to BKK - head winds which are normal this time of year. Now if I know that why didn't the so-called professionals at AA know it? If they had asked me I could have told them the time allowed was insufficient anytime of year. There was no AA staff on the ground, only contract airport staff that had limited interest in passenger / customer satisfaction so the process took hours and with little or no regard for customer concerns or comfort. AA does not know when to quit abusing its customers - meaningless and cynical frequent flyers programs and now they ask you to buy miles when you check in - miles you used to be earning! To allowing their passengers to wonder around international airports looking for help form other airlines. However the HKG to BKK was nice - thanks to Thai Airways."
2165,"  Full flight in Charlotte and no one boarded yet, ten minutes after scheduled departure time. Reason? One cabin attendant is late arriving. (AA 1648). Wonder how brain dead you have to be not to make judgement call to board plane so when tardy flight attendant actually arrives, we can get going."
2166,"  I didn't have high expectations from American Airlines on this flight from Newark to Phoenix, but I was rather surprised. Boarding was quick, the flight was not so full and I managed to snatch a exit row seat without extra charge, where UA would not allow it. Crew were friendly, attentive, polite and seemed happy to be at their job. The 5 hours flew so fast on this superb flight across the U.S. The next leg to Long Beach was alright, the crew were not as friendly but it was a very short flight."
2167,"  New York JFK to London Heathrow. I flew with American Airlines as a code share booked with British Airways. I was concerned because I knew the BA Club World Cabin and knew what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised. Airlines business cabin is far superior to BA. There is far more room in the seat for storage and shelf space as well as small pockets to stow a mobile whilst charging. The seat is far more private and the kit bag is much better too. I was on a seat near the galley, which was a little noisy so don't reserve a seat too close to the galley on a night flight. I'd had dinner so went straight to sleep. I wasn't impressed by the breakfast, but all else was far superior to British Airways."
2168,"  Keāhole to Chicago via Los Angeles. I travel frequently and have a bag that fits under the seat. This has happened 3 times in the last month on AA - gate agents who insist on taking your bag ""saying there is no more room in the overhead"". The last gate agent was really rude about it however guys with huge backpacks were allowed, just no roller bags. Of couse when I got on the plane, there was still room in the overhead and room underneath my ""economy plus"" seat. I wouldn't care if it was a short flight but AA is consistently late and in the last month I had to spend the night in Miami due to their late takeoff and arrival, and they had checked my carry at the gate, to my final destination (Las Vegas) using their same lame excuse. The other problem happening far too often comes at landing. The last 2 flights were held up for at least 45 min. because ""a plane was broken at the gate we are supposed to park at"". How about a little better tower communication and finding an alternate gate so people dont miss their connections. Here's how todays flights went on AA...flight AA246 acheduled to leave Kona at 3:35, leaves 45 min late jeopardizing my LAX/ORD connection, finally arrives LA X and we wait 40 more min because of ""broken plane at gate"". Good thing the plane to ORD was delayed, supposed to leave at 11:20, we are still on the tarmack at 2:08 am, without my carry on. This airline has problems!"
2169,"  Chicago to Manchester on American Airlines Boeing 757. No personal entertainment screen, rock hard seats. Unacceptable for a transatlantic flight in 2016! Never had worse. Does American Airlines not realise that people fly outside of the USA and need more amenities. Overnight I now have a sore back and neck. Never again."
2170,"  Nashville to Dayton via Washington. My original flight was scheduled to leave at 1p.m. and arrive in Washington D.C. at 3:30p.m. From there I had a connecting flight from Washington D.C. to Dayton Ohio. My travel time was supposed to be done by 7:30p.m. The day of my flight at 2:30a.m. my flights were canceled due to maintenance. That is when I had my first call with the American Airlines representatives. The representative booked me a different flight, which cut my travel time since I was to leave Nashville at 2:15p.m. and get to Chicago at 3:30p.m. and from there I would leave at 4:30p.m. and get to Dayton Ohio at 6:15p.m. In Nashville my flight was delayed for over 4 hours and the representatives would not let me on another flight. I talked to a total of 5 representatives who told me 5 different things and all of them had attitudes with me. I had to get another connecting flight in Chicago which did not leave until 9:40p.m. I did not reach Dayton until 11:53p.m. I spent over 12 hours in an airport, was not offered any compensation, and I had nothing to eat because I could not afford it and I thought I would be to my destination earlier. "
2171,"I booked a flight from Chicago to San Antonio three months in advance. The day of my flight, I was there 2 hrs early only to be informed that my flight was canceled 10 min before my arrival. So instead, American Airlines assigned me a new route which required me to stop in Dallas and then onto San Antonio. The plane was not ready for flight so we had to wait another 2hrs. This is not my worst experience with flying but still, it's the fact of the matter. If I showed up late to my flight, canceled, or had to switch, American Airlines would charge me for that mistake. But when the airline screws up, canceling my flight with no notice whatsoever, there are no consequences. "
2172," My red-eye flight from Philadelphia to San Francisco with American Airlines was supposed to be nonstop. Upon arrival to the boarding gate, the American posting board still read nonstop, and only at last minute were we informed that the plane would make a fuel stop in Kansas City. As this was a full flight, there was no overhead space for my carry-on so there I was stuck having to jam my luggage and backpack under the seat with no place for my feet. We sat on the ground for an hour, and ultimately arrived 2-hours late at our destination. A review of the AA615 activity log indicates this is not an uncommon occurrence. Some missed connections, I missed a lunch meeting. It is unacceptable to have an airline presumably save a few bucks on fuel at their passengers' expense. This seemingly selfish unapologetic action significantly tainted an otherwise OK flying experience."
2173,"  Due to fly American Airlines from Dallas Fort Worth to Bogota. This is by far the worst service ever and I still stranded at the airport with two of my kids lying on the floor tring to sleep. Why because delays, supposly weather and a crew that was unable to fly due to over the limit time of hours flown, they took as back and then cancelled the flight. Disappointed travelers, kids, families people upset, crying due to the great neglicence of some of the attendants, being extremelly insensitive with was happening. Now booked to Cancun to try to reach Bogota. I am just without words, this is not in anyway fair, and and in any way an airline that you can trust. Never ever ever in my life I will made a booking with your company, where customers are treated with no respect. Just 0/10"
2174,Flight 2326 from Lubbock to Atlanta got cancelled today because of weather which is understandable but too many times that I have flown American Airlines something happens. Last time I was on an American flight we were in the air from Dallas to Lubbock and we had to go back to Dallas and de-plane because of mechanical issues or something. Time before that my bag got lost because my plane from Lubbock to Dallas was delayed and I had to run to my next flight. I'm so sick of American Airlines. If they are gonna be this bad then give us better prices or compensation.
2175,"New York JFK to Akron–Canton via Charlotte. Over the past two months I have been traveling through Europe and taken countless flights, but this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. To begin with, the boarding procedure was delayed because the previous flight arrived late. After getting the plane ready the crew boarded us about 30 minutes after our original boarding time. Everyone got on the aircraft and sat and waited for a long time before being told they were experiencing mechanical issues and they were bringing people in to check out the situation. We sat and waited and then were finally told that if we would like to get off the plane we were welcome to. I proceeded to leave the plane to speak with an agent because I knew that I was going to miss my connecting flight in CLT. There was one travel agent available for a whole airplane of people and she seemed to care less about helping us because her shift was supposed to be ending. I asked if I could change my end destination to a larger airport that was within 300 miles of my original end point and I was told no. The only option they could give me was a flight out the next day. I took the new flight information and proceeded to call the service number where I was told the exact opposite information that the travel agent at the airport told me. However, there is nothing that the agents over the phone can do because they cannot physically give you a new boarding pass or vouchers to make up for the inconvenience. By the time I was about to get back in line to speak with the travel agent in person and inform her of what I was told on the phone, there was a line of about 20 people. I went back to the gate and was told to re-board the plane if we had new boarding passes and had been situated on a new flight out of CLT. I got back on the plane and sat for all of five minutes to be told that their flight crew had timed out and a new crew would not arrive for at least another hour. We once again had to exit the plane and go sit by the gate. They did provide us some snacks while we waited and the crew did not arrive until 2 hours later. There was still only one travel agent available to assist passengers who needed to re-book their flights and the customer support agents were impatient, rude, and acted as though this was our problem and not their own. I do not remember hearing the words ""I am sorry for the inconvenience"" once out of anybody. After sitting until 1:00am they finally had a crew and boarded us for a third time on the plane. It took forever to take off and we landed in CLT at about 3:30am. We were told we would receive hotel vouchers, transportation, and food once in CLT. Clearly JFK did not communicate the issues to CLT because the members in Charlotte had no idea what was going on and we had to wait another hour for a supervisor to come out and speak to us. At this point, there was no point in getting a hotel voucher because flights would be leaving within a few hours. I finally spoke with an agent who put me on an earlier flight to a different airport that was close to my original destination. He also provided me with a food voucher. This was the first time that I received answers and was helped in a caring and apologetic way. This was also the first time that I was not quickly shut down and told no. I finally made it home after many hours, many tears, and lots of frustration. The lack of support and concern for their passengers is ridiculous and I will never fly AA again."
2176,"Baltimore to Miami with American Airlines. This was one of the worst flight experiences I had ever had. Our flight was meant to leave at 530 am and due to icy weather conditions, we were delayed 6 hours. Although the staff were kind, we ended up waiting on the aircraft for hours with little to no information. When we finally took off, about an hour into the flight the pilot informed us that due to a mechanical malfunction we would have to make an emergency landing in Jacksonville (intended destination = Miami.) Again captain and crew were great - no complaints. Once we landed, we were told very little about the prognosis of our aircraft and we ended up having to wait in a huge group of 160 people as we learned very slowly that the flight could not be officially cancelled until they were certain they couldn't find a replacement captain and crew, but also couldn't help us rebook a new flight to make connections. Thus, this all resulted in zero contingency plan and lots of unnecessary waiting. When we finally departed for Miami at 1030 pm on the original aircraft with a new captain and crew, we were promised hotel and transportation vouchers upon our arrival in MIA. However when we arrived, the line to receive these vouchers was hundreds of people long with no end in sight. I (along with hundreds of other passengers) were extremely disappointed with the lack of organization or a streamlined process."
2177,"Seattle to London. Don't even bother asking the American Airlines service team to help you. If you have a question - it doesn't matter. Simply walking up to the kiosk to ask them if we could upgrade our seats (6 hours in advanced) we were told don't bother unless it's 24 hours in advanced. ""It doesn't matter unless it's done 24 hours in advanced. You will not get your request."" The interesting part of this was, we only walked up to the kiosk to ask them if it was a possibility to upgrade our seats. We weren't expecting it, only asking if it was a possibility. Interestingly enough, the American Airlines attendant told us there was not point in talking to them unless we did it 24 hours in advanced. I don't care about that. I just wanted to ask. I had no idea it was an ubsurdity to ask for something like that unless it was 24 hours in advanced. Now I know."
2178,"  Buffalo to La Guardia Philadelphia. If I could give them negative stars I would. Absolutely the worst airline and day of my life. Not only did I receive a text that my connecting flight was canceled an hour before departure, but the staff was rude and unhelpful. We ended up leaving an hour after departure time, without being told about any delays. My check in bag was 4 pounds over and he wanted to charge me an extra $100."
2179,"Chicago to Miami. As every year I flew to Miami after attending a medical congress in Chicago so used my AAdvantage points to book a free flight to Florida on November 30th. As I am aware some American Airlines planes are very old I usually try to book a flight operated by some newish Boeing 737-800 which are very common on this route: this year I wanted to fly business class (they call it First but it's just a trick) so I had limited options for ny reward ticket and I ended up in a 4:40pm flight. They changed the plane to a B757 a few weeks after my booking so in the end my flight was operated by a glorious aircraft from the '80s with extremely wide but hard seats with limited recline capability. Because of a technical issue, departure was delayed for about one hour (this happened in about 40% of all the flights I had with AA so far, kind of disturbing if you compare with other major airlines) but no big deal as I was not in a hurry. No PTV on the seat just the old fashioned hanging monitor with terrible sound and video quality, so bad they even had to interrupt the safety video because it was a torture for our ears. Flight was uneventful with a pleasant purser who greeted passengers one by one by shaking their hands both upon boarding and before landing. I did not feel like eating so did not try the meal which did look fine by the way (chicken with some vegetables). The one and only positive thing about this trip was I paid 5USD: not sure I will repeat the experience though, unless I am absolutely sure I can fly on a more recent aircraft with better and modern features."
2180,"  I was attempting to fly home for Christmas break with American Airlines and arrived two hours prior to my 1.15 flight from Pensacola Florida to Dallas Texas. My flight was delayed once, which caused me to have to move my connecting flight back to a later time. And then my flight was delayed two more times. I was supposed to leave at 1.15 and now they are estimating that my flight will leave at 4.20. If there is another delay I will have to move my connecting flight to a later time once again. The attendants at the counter are being very rude and extremely unhelpful. I am just waiting for the next delay/the next thing to go wrong. I have missed several events that I was planning on attending this evening. If this airline decides to pull it together, I may be able to make it home by tomorrow."
2181,"  My American Airlines flight from Miami to Rio de Janeiro was terrible, the tv didn't work and to watch tv it would play for 5 minutes and then re-connect for the next hour. The arm rest couldn't be left up so I had to hold it up the whole 7 hours flight so my daughter could lay on my lap to sleep. And the food was terrible.  I'm very disappointed.  I will never use American Airlines again. Not even for my business trip"
2182,"  I was flying MIA to LHR via JFK with American Airlines. This review is for the MIA-JFK route. I was originally booked onto a 757, international configuration with angled lie flat seats. However I took the opportunity to do a same day flight change and get an earlier flight, this would enable me to do a quick bit of shopping. Additionally the change of flight allowed me to sample a reconfigured 767, with the lie flat seats. I arrived at MIA at 6.45am for my 9.26am departure. There was no queue for the Priority check-in and I just needed to pick up my boarding passes as I was hand bag only. The check-in associate was friendly and helpful. I had access to fast track security and I was through in 5 minutes. I used the Admirals Club at Gate 30. It was a pretty pathetic offering, unlike the AA First class lounge at JFK which is excellent. The AC had a very limited free breakfast offering and I had a bagel and coffee. I was provided with a single drinks voucher which I used to get a bottle of water for the flight. Boarding commenced on time at precisely 8.56am - 30 minutes before departure. After people with access needs boarded, First class passengers were invited to board. On boarding a FA offered to hang my coat and I was offered a pre departure drink and I selected coffee. On international legs, a Samsung tablet is provided, but only main screen entertainment was offered on this short 2.5 hour flight. I was provided with in ear headphones. The seat was excellent, fully flat with plenty of space. I was seated in 6D, I would have preferred a window but none where available at checkin. I would have been happy with this seat on an international sector, so felt spoilt for a short domestic flight. The FA who looked after me was great, friendly, attentive and address me by my name. Cereal or a three cheese omelette were on offer. I chose the latter which was definitely the most popular choice. The omelette and the sausage provided were not great, but the side veggies and biscuit were excellent. After eating I promptly fell asleep for the remainder of the flight. Overall besides the poor lounge offering, this was an excellent domestic flight."
2183,"Flew from Las Vegas to Dallas. It was not my first flight but it was first experience with American Airlines. The first thing I noticed that made American Airlines different to any of the other airlines I have flown with was the unfriendly, unsmiling and unhelpful staff. Second huge difference was the customer service, which does not exist. I had only one carry on bag with me, which I usually fly with have never had any problems bringing it on board. American Airlines stewardess told me to leave my carry on bag because it was too big even though I saw passengers in front of me passing with no problems with carry on bags far bigger than mine. The rest of the flight was just same, unfriendly and careless. At the end of our flight we were offered to buy American Airlines point cards. Well, before asking to spend us money on flights with them, American Airlines should provide at least a professional service and start treating passengers right."
2184,"We booked a roundtrip flight using mileage points flying from Charlotte to Albuquerque with American Airlines. When you do this and you go to select seats, all the front row seats back about 20 rows, and all the aisle seats, except for the last few rows in the aircraft are blocked out and you are not allowed to book them. You also cannot pay extra to upgrade to a seat with extra leg room. I think this is a terrible thing to do to loyal customers who use the airline, expecting to be able to use their miles for trips - to punish them by relegating them to the rear of the aircraft. I'm changing my loyality to another airline. "
2185,"This was an ok flight from Boston to Chicago with American Airlines, it was incredibly smooth, and it was 20 minutes early. Now I know that it was a short flight, but there wasn't much of an option for food. Our flight was at noon, but all they gave us was some pretzels and peanuts. The seat was very small, but cozy. There were seatback televisions with on demand video, not a surmountable amount of options, wifi worked perfectly and I was able to get lots of work done. The flight attendants were sweet and caring. The landing was ok, we spent most of our 45 minute stop in Chicago taxing around the airport. Very nice staff overall."
2186,"Dallas DFW to Kansas City with American Airlines. ""Mechanical Issues"". Absolutely no information given, flight delayed 2+ hours. Couldn't get any other plane. Useless would be an understatement. Loved spending 6+ hours in an airport doing nothing on a Sunday. Had to pay for 1 checked bag that weighed nearly nothing. Will try to avoid in the future."
2187,"Very glad to finally have nonstop service to and from JFK. The service on the return flight from JFK to Tucson in Economy Preferred seating was non existent. Monday 8:00 PM departure on November 22nd from JFK to Tucson, immediate announcement from the cockpit that we could expect air turbulence and the seat belt sign would remain on the entire flight. We encountered three or four slight bumps mid flight, that was it totally smooth flying. Since the seat belt sign was pre determined to stay on it gave the entire plane, except first class no cabin service on the five plus hour flight. The other major uncomfortable problem was the cabin temperature was around 80 degrees and yet there was no one to ask about getting air turned down. No one approached any of the passengers on this five plus hour flight. I arrived Tucson soaked with sweat and dehydrated from no fluid. The first thing I did the next day was cancel the future flights I had booked on American. I realize the airline is working hard to make a comeback, they still have a lot of problems and created a very unpleasant flight back from a long weekend in NYC. Definitely worth the extra time to stop and change planes in Atlanta, have never had a problem like this with any other airline and have traveled for forty five years! "
2188,"Barcelona to New York JFK with American Airlines. Had several problems whilst upgrading a seat, I got triple charged, AA took a lifetime to credit my account again. As compensation they gave a $25 reward voucher, (I spent over £40 in telephone calls to their ridiculous call centre to get them to sort out this issue). Inflight staff and staff in both airports were extremely rude and snobby, always looking down on you. Generally quite unprofessional. The staff on our flight told us not to call a flight attendant for beverages, instead we were supposed to go to the back of the plane and request them (unheard of on a long haul) .I told them this was ridiculous and that I would do no such thing as that would involve waking up a fellow passenger sleeping next to us on a aisle seat. We were delayed by 2 hours due to a technical issue and there was no update from the captain on whether or not we would make up the time. Check in and airport staff in JFK need to learn some customer service skills. No smiling, rude people that generally look fed up in life and with their job. They sigh, they roll their eyes. Quite possibly the rudest staff I have ever dealt with. (I fly a lot with many airlines). Generally a massive disappointment, I expected better from AA."
2189,"  
I've been flying American Airlines for all of 2016 and I've flown Southwest and United due to no direct flights in Texas from Denver. I've never been harassed more over the last 2 flights about my carry-on ever. It isn't a large bag, fits in your overhead for all 50+ flights I've been on with AA. It is smaller than other bags that got on after me, but the gate agents feel the need to pick on their FF members. I travel every week for work and I will be choosing another airline and credit card for 2017. American Airlines needs to learn to treat their Frequent Flyers with more respect."
2190,"  Flight from Sydney to Los Angeles was relatively uneventful but the crew insisted on slamming every cabinet door shut for the duration. Impossible to sleep or even rest. Most of the business class crew were too busy working to provide service. Los Angeles to Dallas Ft Worth was a disaster. Originally scheduled in First Class on a Boeing 787, changed equipment to A321. Bumped from first class to a middle seat in economy with minimal compensation ($300 future flight credit) and no explanation or apology or even an understanding of why we were irritated. I was actually told by a gate agent that I should be glad we were seated together. Once onboard we were told we could buy drinks, snacks and headsets, all normally free to first class passengers. We were also never told how it was decided which of the first class passengers were bumped. When I asked I was ignored. There were about 12 passengers bumped and put in row 30 or higher in economy, half in middle seats. Horrible handling by AA staff. Dallas Ft Worth to Tampa flight was uneventful and flight crew was courteous."
2191,"EZE-MIA in new cabin layout on daytime flight. Very good service, drinks and IFE. Highly recommend the daytime flight as passengers are not hurried along to finish eating so the crew can sleep, etc. Flight on time. Upon arrival, despite the arrivals video showing automated immigration processes, it is still time consuming. Return flight from DFW to EZE on very old B777, with old 2-3-2 layout. Seats worn, cabin staff tired and food ditto. As American Airlines has no competition on this route they do not make an effort to improve their service, Flight on time."
2192,"Miami - London - Dallas Fort Worth. Both flights on B777 with new layouts in Business class. Excellent service, not overwhelming. Food and drink selection good. Plenty of movies and live TV to chose from. Flights on time. Very good arrivals lounge at LHR terminal 3."
2193,"Los Angeles to Guayaquil via Miami with American Airlines. After a 1.5 hour delay flying from LAX to Miami I barely made it to my connecting flight to Ecuador. After boarding we sat and waited for 1 hour until they announced that due to over loading of cargo and luggage we can't fly until tomorrow. We had to leave the plane with nothing, I was hungry and thirsty waiting to get to the airport motel. We were given $12 vouchers for food - what you can buy with that at an airport food court? This is the second time AA has done this to me."
2194,"When nothing goes wrong the airlines are all the same. When it goes wrong is where they differentiate themselves; American Airlines so often can't seem to handle a situation professionally and positively. Flew Chicago to Paris via Dallas Ft Worth in 1st/Business Class. The morning of the flight I checked and at 7am, and my 1pm flight was already showing it would be delayed. Amazing that 6 hours before my flight and before the plane has left its initial city that it was delayed. I called American Airlines and they changed me to the 11:45am flight to DFW - all good. Flight left on time - sat in the AAdmirals lounge for a couple hours and made my way to the gate for the Paris flight (AA 48). Boarding time was close and then all of a sudden we see the entire crew come off the plane. 20 min past boarding time they announce that there is a mechanical issue and there is a plane 2 gates down we can take. Great. We get there and wait for 2 hours - being told its taking that much time to move our catering and luggage over from one plane to the other - just a few gates away. After 90 minutes they brought chips and drinks which was nice. And they were re-routing people with connections as in the end it was over a 2+ hour delay on arriving into Paris. The inflight service was excellent - they were apologetic about the delay and the FA serving my aisle was funny and considerate. But again - nothing from American Airlines once I landed. With Delta - you have such a delay you check your email and you have an apology and 10,000 points in your account. Proactive - great policy. American? Nothing. No email. No offer. Just deal with it. So I complained online and they sent me 7,500 miles and an apology. I appreciate it but it also doesn't make up for the Euro 166 I had to pay for my new train ticket from Paris to Amsterdam that I missed due to the flight delay. But again the US airlines don't care about those issues for their passengers. It's sad a great flight is destroyed by the ground service and overall lack of care by AA customer service for their flights that severely inconvenience passengers"
2195," We were scheduled to leave Kahului at 8:53 PM to Dallas to connect to a flight to Harrisburg with American Airlines. We sat on the tarmac for 3 hours with only 2 updates the entire time before they cancelled the flight due to mechanical issues. We were never once offered a beverage and the planes air conditioning had to be turned off so it was sweltering in the cabin with every seat occupied. Once we exited the aircraft, it was sheer chaos in attempting to figure out our next move and we were told we were not allowed to leave the airport. After waiting in the airport for another 2 hours with small children, we were finally given a voucher to a cheap hotel. Our family's flights were all completely different when they were finally rescheduled. I had to pay $100 to be able to stay in our room until 6 PM and our new flight did not even leave until midnight. Our new flight was late getting in into Phoenix and then delayed another 2 hours before we could leave for Chicago. When I questioned how we would make our connecting flight in Chicago, the AA staff was rude and snapped ""Well, I guess you won't now, will you?"" We missed our connecting flight and had to wait another 4 hours in Chicago. When I tried to speak with someone in customer service, I was told repeatedly that I had to go to the website and file a complaint. When I did speak to someone that basically told me ""too bad, you're flight already happened"". Our large family travels quite a bit and will never use American Airlines again. We refuse to fly with incompetent, rude and ignorant staff. We were never even offered any vouchers. This airline is a joke and greedy. They care nothing about their clients."
2196,"  Baltimore to Juliaca via Miami and Lima. I wish I could say that ""I will never fly on American Airlines again"" like some reviewers, but the truth is, with mergers and consolidation it is difficult to do this. This was a trip to Peru, with the flights split between American and LATAM airlines. Three legs of the trip were on American and three on LATAM. The comparison was not good for American. First of all, of the three legs, two of the planes had mechanical issues which led in one case to have to switch planes and the other to sit on the tarmac for an hour. The longest flight was from Miami to Lima on a 767. It looked and felt old and worn out. The seats were pure punishment. They were not the new ""slim line"" seats, but were worn to the point of being hard. The legroom was poor, and I'm only 5'6"". I can't imaging what a six foot tall person had to endure. There was no in seat entertainment, just the drop down screens in various locations. We had a chance to alter our trip plans, and it would have been convenient to change our return trip to leave from Cusco instead of Juliaca. All other legs of the trip would be the same. American could do it for an increase of $7,500! They said the flights were full, and we would have to fly business class. We pointed out that we were holding economy class seats on two flights, so they couldn't be sold out. The response was, ""That's our policy."" I will do whatever I can to avoid them in the future."
2197,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Miami. I have over one million miles on American Airlines, but it doesn't mean anything. Crew was great but you can see why American is rated so low. Food was nothing real. And just an overall feeling that American is in business to just make money and foolishly doesn't know or want to know how to be a great airline again. It is sad. "
2198,"  Baltimore to Dallas. This has happened multiple times to my husband and I. We book our tickets together under the same itinerary 2 months in advance and we checked in 3 hours in advance and everytime we are given different seats. I find it sexist and incompetent for an airline to not put two people together that are booking their tickets under one itinerary. Sexist because they probably do this because I did not take my husbands last name, incompetent because they cannot look and see that the itinerary was booked under one confirmation number. We ended up having to sit all the way in the back in order to be together because that was all the airline could do after they had messed up."
2199,Richmond to Chicago with American Airlines. Flight crew were pleasant and were occasionally making the necessary announcements. Flight was on schedule and we also had the privilege of having a commentary when flew over significant locations. It was a nice gesture by the deck crew. Luggage arrived safely and timely too. Overall good impression.
2200,"London to New York JFK with American Airlines. Boarding and departure was timely; in fact we arrived half an hour ahead of schedule which was nice. Baggage information was vague as I had three versions of my ticket with different checked in baggage weight information. As I was on an AA ticket from KUL, I had to ""re-issue"" the boarding pass at their transfer desk in LHR although I already had it issued at KUL. Unfortunately, the seats on this aircraft are not as comfortable as their B77W as the width and seat pitch were narrow. I was given a blanket which was packed in a plastic only to find strands of hair attached to it. Food and cabin service was mediocre but the entertainment was alright. Quite a disappointment for a legacy carrier on a transatlantic route."
2201,"You know when American Airlines come on the intercom and say we know you have a choice and thank you for choosing them? Please don't choose them. We were flying first class from Denver to St. Thomas via Miami. The plane arrived late to Denver from Dallas due to mechanical issues, which made our connection to St. Thomas very close. When the pilot made up some time we had hopes of making the connection, however when we landed, our gate was not ready and we sat on the tarmac for the 20 minutes. There were at least 12 of us on that flight that missed the plane, and we missed it because the connecting flight left early. The staff for AA were not helpful at all, and would not answer any questions. They were politely rude. They gave us a certificate for an airport hotel, and did not get us our luggage. The next day we were placed on another plane, but not in first class, but in coach. We lost our one night stay at our hotel and because it was 6 hours from the time we would have checked in, they charged us for it. Then we were told that we have to ask for the refund from AA (e.g. lets not make it simple for the customer, lets make it harder for them). Well I just got my refund and guess what, it is only $98.35 each. Does that make up the difference in first class and coach? They have no way to challenge a refund or even to talk to someone. (again, lets make it hard on the customer). You have a choice. Don't choose American Airlines. I know that I won't if I have any other option."
2202,"Flew American Airlines PUJ to PDX. I have never had such a horrible experience with an airline. To start, we were forced to change our departure flight to a significantly less desirable itinerary (from 1 stop to 2, which added 2 hours to our travel time). Turns out that particular flight would end up being cancelled after mechanical difficulty inflight. Don't get me wrong, I'm thankful for our safety. But after turning around and returning to the gate to stand in line for 7 hours one gets a little a testy. After standing in said line we were given no information about when we would be on another flight and another hour later were shuttled to a hotel where we still received no info. I had to call the airline myself, from a foreign county to find out how I was going to make it home. After being given the wrong information and seeing that our online itinerary had us going to the wrong final destination I had to call again. We finally made it home about 30 hours later. We were in good spirits as was most of the flight despite our trouble. However after several hours of no organization or communication and being left to fend for ourselves on how to get home we were all pretty livid. I wouldn't normally go out of my way to share a negative experience but this was so grossly mishandled that I thought others should know. I would gladly pay the extra money to fly with anyone else next time. We were given no compensation for our original flight change, nor our cancellation troubles."
2203," San Juan to Kansas City VIA Miami. My wife and I arrived at American Airlines departures in San Juan PR within 1.5 hours of our departure. We stood in a line for 20 minutes, when we finally reached the window we were told that we were in the wrong line and were re-directed to another line which took us an additional 25 minutes to get through. When we finally got to the agent we were told that our bag at this point could not be checked and could not fly to Charlotte because it was inside an hour of flight time. We were then told we could not fly on our original flight to Charlotte and now had to fly standby to Miami. Our Miami flight was delayed over 30 minutes which caused us to miss our connecting flight to Kansas City. We were stranded in Miami and the next flight out wasn't until 5:20 a.m. the following morning and that would fly into Dallas and then into Kansas City. When we finally arrived in Kansas City our checked baggage was not there and we were told it was in Charlotte NC, the airport we were told we could not fly into because the bag was late. If they would have just let us get on our original flight our 6 hour flight time would not have taken 2 days. Very unhappy and will re-think flying AA in the future."
2204,"Flew American Airlines from Manchester, NH to St. Thomas via Philadelphia (layover). On a connecting flight, first flight was delayed over an hour due to getting a half an inch of snow twelve hours before. The connecting flight was set to leave an hour and a half after our original flight, but we missed the closing of the doors by two minutes. They told us that they couldn't have delayed or held the doors open, but on our first flight they held the doors open another 25 minutes after we had boarded for one person, and we were a whole family. We were very disappointed in the way that this company handled our situation, since we did everything we could, including sprinting to the gate, while they barely helped with our situation. Now, instead of getting to our destination at 11 am we will be arriving at 10 pm."
2205,"  AA 2234 on 20 November ORD-DFW. Originally scheduled on a later flight to connect to Paris but woke up and checked and aircraft operating the inbound flight to Chicago was already an hour late (at 7am in the morning for a 1pm departure - how is it delayed already?). Called AA and they switched me to 2234 departing at 11.45am. Fun friendly ticket agent checked my bag to CDG, and then off to Flagship lounge where you are always greeted with a smile. Good food and drink. Flight boarded on-time and flight attendants were excellent. Smiles, chatty, helpful - really nice. Salad with chicken breast was ok - nothing special but it's airline food. Landed 15 minutes early and pilot thanked everyone as they got off the plane. Great flight!"
2206, Miami to Charlotte with American Airlines. I travel often and I will never fly AA again. Staff not friendly at all. They weren't rude but don't seem to like their jobs. I was double charged for my bags and I had to go as far as to get my card provider on the phone with me so that they would fix there own mistake because they wouldnt fix it at the point of sale - very poor.
2207,"  Flew American Airlines from SJC-PHX-MIA-MVD, returning MVD-MIA-LAX-SJC, in November 2016. The PHX–MIA flight departed one hour late, all other flights were on time. Check-in desk staff, gate agents, and cabin crew were consistently courteous and attentive. Complimentary food on MIA-MVD-MIA sector was acceptable, and the turkey sandwich I purchased on the MIA-LAX flight was very good. Planes were clean and appeared well kept. It got very cold during some flights. Legroom was tight and seats were minimally comfortable, which I expected for the price I paid for the trip. The Boeing 767-300 they use for the MIA-MVD-MIA sector, only has overhead TV screens where they show just one movie on a 9-hour flight, and their overhead compartments are so shallow that a standard carry-on bag only fits in sideways (instead of wheels-first)."
2208, Albuquerque to Fresno via Phoenix with American Airlines. Worst service ever. Flew American Airlines due to time of flights. Total waste of money for first class or any for that matter. Flight attendant made it clear upon entering plane she was unhappy and this was her last flight of the day. Practically had to beg for water 30 minutes inflight. Attendants hate their job and don't fail to let customers know it. On the second flight there was a trainee. All 3 stewardesses spent the last 20 minutes of flight complaining about an economy customer in front of everyone in first class. The experience was poor. Go Southwest or Delta because American Airlines employees are angry and take it out on customers.
2209,Washington Reagan to Dallas/Fort Worth. The A321 aircraft appeared to be new. Our seats in first class were comfortable with acceptable legroom. The first class cabin was very clean and inviting. Very nice service by the staff and the lunch (a cooked Italian pasta dish and salad ) was not bad. The red wine was OK as well. But where this flight really shined concerned the very impressive inflight entertainment (IFE) system featuring a huge number of video and audio selections as well as an upgraded map display with a number of different views of our flight in progress available. This was the best domestic IFE I have ever experienced.
2210,Las Vegas to Indianapolis via Los Angeles with American Airlines. Our first plane was delayed due to weather in LAX so we sat on the tarmac. The flight attendants were extremely rude to both my wife and myself. We finally got to LAX and had to wait to get off the plane because a group of Chinese tourists needed to get to the International terminal. We were then shepherded into an office where we stood for 2 hours - our plane had already left the airport before we arrived to which no one told us because getting the other people off was much more important. When we finally got to the main counter we were told that the only plane we could get was at 11.35pm that night - it was only 9am. We tried to negotiate to get another airline or even a hotel and catch the direct plane the next morning but we were told if we wanted to do any of that it would be at our own cost. We stayed in LAX and when I got home I sent an email to American Airlines and they sent me a $100 voucher for my next flight with them.
2211, Miami to Denver with American Airlines. Worst customer service of any airline. Most gate staff and attendants argue with their customers about selectively enforced regulations. The staff clearly frustrated in their jobs and has forgotten the importance of taking care of the guests who ultimately provide their pay checks.
2212,"  New York to Dallas. I had 2 terrible experiences with American Airlines. The first was a direct flight to Nashville leaving at 9:30 am. I was boarded on the plane and asked to leave the plane because there was too much weight on the aircraft. Yes, you heard that correctly. American Airlines put me on the next flight available which was a 6:30 connecting flight to Chicago. I got to Nashville after 10:00 pm and missed the reunion party. However, they did give me a $200 voucher to fly again. When I attempted to use the voucher on my next flight, I was told that voucher only has 14 digits. We only accept 19 digit vouchers. Unbelievable. Please save yourself the aggravation and fly elsewhere."
2213,"New York to Tulsa via Chicago with American Airlines. Horrible and recommend that others avoid AA. Late take-off, sitting on the tarmac for over an hour, switched terminals at the last minute, nearly missing connecting flight only to race to the plane and sit at the gate for another 45 minutes due to an electrical problem. I don't care attitude displayed by any ""professional"" staff member. In Manhattan where I expected rudeness they were polite - on American no such luck. Travelers beware."
2214,"  New York La Guardia to Miami. My wife, son and I flew to New York to attend my sister in-laws funeral. On the day of the burial the church services and burial were running behind schedule. We immediately contacted American Airlines and explained that we were attending the burial and that we would not be able to make our original flight which was scheduled for 1:29 pm. We were promptly taken care of and placed on the 5:15 pm flight for a mere $75 per person extra. Where is your heart American? This was clearly an emergency and we had paperwork to substantiate our position. At the very least you could have waived the fees!! Anyway, we get to the airport and are waiting at the gate to be boarded. I've never seen such chaos!! Normally people are boarded from the back of the plane to the front, after boarding ""Priority"" passengers first. After calling for Priority passengers, the chaos began. They never called us by section and people were being boarded in a disorderly fashion. The best part was after half the people had boarded already they decided to stop the rest of us and have us check in our carry-on luggage if they had wheels on them. Who the heck has carry-on luggage without wheels these days? That added extra time and aggravation to this flight. To add insult to injury we were subjected to the most uncomfortable seats and worst snacks.  We will never fly American Airlines again - they are insensitive and disorganized!"
2215,"Return trip to Miami from LAX on one of American Airlines newest A321 planes (very reasonable fare too). Left on a Tuesday afternoon so flight load was minimal. Had a whole row of seats to myself and sat near an exit row, so had good amount of space. Purchased some snacks on board. Flight departed slightly late and arrived with a slight delay, but a great onboard experience. Friendly flight attendants as well (was given a free set of headphones) and excellent IFE (good choice of movies). Much better than the Boeing 737 that American flies to SFO from MIA. Would take this plane on this route in the future."
2216,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Paris CDG, connecting to El Al for flight to Tel Aviv. After checking in approximately 3.5 hours prior to departure, which is ample time for international travel, and my bag being tagged as ""Priority,"" since Monday, November 7, no one can tell me with certainty where my luggage is. In CDG I was told that I needed to give the gate agents the code for my padlocks even though they are TSA approved. I complied with their request and gave them my code. Prior to arrival in Tel Aviv, I was advised by the flight attendant that my bag had not made it on the flight and to ensure that I would file a claim with El Al at the Lost Baggage counter prior to exiting the TLV airport, which I did. The agent there told me that there were two flights coming in later, and that my case would be on one of them. They gave me a bag with very basic toiletries and what looked like a short pyjama suited for my 10 year-old granddaughter. They told me that there was no allowance until after 24 hours. I was also asked to cross off from my declaration any items over $100 so I wouldn't need to return to the airport to pay duty on those items. I questioned the accuracy of her statement, but the agent who filed my claim with El Al insisted that I had to cross off on my form what I had begun to list as items over $100 in value, which I did. That was Tuesday, November 8. On Wednesday, November 9, the hotel concierge followed up on my claim. The person he spoke with said for me to get whatever I needed and to keep all receipts. That evening the concierge followed up with El Al again, who informed us that my luggage was still in Dallas! I called back and spoke with Maya, who told me American Airlines had put my luggage on a flight to Toronto and then it was scheduled to get onto an Air Canada flight to Tel Aviv. ETA was now for Thursday morning. I am joining a Holy Land tour and had gone a few days ahead to spend visiting Jerusalem. Instead, I have been wasting my time trying to track my luggage.  A hotel guest relayed to the concierge and me that El Al had told her that if she wanted her luggage the day it had arrived, she would have to get a taxi to and fro the airport as their courier was no longer available, which she had no other choice but to do it. Armed with this information I hung tight by the hotel. On Thursday morning (I departed on Monday), the El Al call center for lost luggage would not put me through a manager as he was calling American Airlines liars. He said he would have a manager call me, which still has not happened. As of Thursday afternoon, American told my husband that they lost track of my luggage in Toronto and that they could not access El Al lost baggage system. El Al claims AA is lying as the lost luggage system is an international system, not El Al's. Until they physically have my case in their possession, El Al cannot do or say anything further. And besides being tagged ""Priority,"" they also have me as VIP in their system. I have lost the extra days in Israel. What promised to be a trip of a lifetime has become a nightmare for me.  It is ironic that my bag was so handled by American Airlines, compounded by El Al. I only have one word : disgraceful."
2217,"  I've had my share of bad experiences with American Airlines including permanently lost luggage, misconnects, delays and rude customer service on the ground and in the air. I’ve tended to avoid them except for domestic US travel so approached this HKG-LAX flight with trepidation. The key attraction was a business class fare significantly lower than any other direct service on the route (and even cheaper than one-stops via Seoul or Taipei). Perhaps I was very impressed because my expectations were set so low. This was a very good flight. Same J class seat as CX, except AA provided a mattress and pyjamas. They served plated food of decent quality and quantity, had a decent wine list and a provided a wide selection of programming on the IFE so delivered on everything you should expect from a world class premium airline. Ultimately what made this flight very good was the crew. They appeared to be enjoying their jobs – lots of smiles and proactive interaction with the passengers. I could not fault any aspect of the service. I’m now willing to consider American Airlines for long haul business class travel if this is the level of service they can deliver consistently. Well done American."
2218,"  Washington DC to Grand Rapids via Chicago. I had only carry-on bags. They took one of my bags at the ramp. I arrived in Chicago for a layover and asked about my bag. I was told I had to get it in Baggage Claim. The stewardess failed to clarify for me that this wasn't my destination. I went to baggage claim (out of secure area), waited for my bag, didn't find it, then was told it was being automatically transferred. I had to go back, through security. The whole mess took an hour and lots of walking, and of the three agents I talked to, none clarified the crux of the problem - that the stewardess should have asked me about destination. I learned, but AA did not seem to."
2219,"  Dallas to Birmingham, AL. I performed a same day reservation change to a later flight in the day. I was charged $75 for the change. I tried to check in online 90 minutes prior to departure three times with no success. I called customer service and asked them for assistance and they said you can only check in online and at the airport. I arrived to the ticket counter 30 minutes prior to my flight and she said this is odd, I can see you are on this flight but there are no seats. I asked how that could be. She even called a coworker over and they said all we can do is put you on standby for the next flight. I was pretty upset and proceeded through security to the gate arriving 15 minutes prior to departure time. I asked the girl at the gate counter why my seat was given away and she called a gentleman over and they whispered as they looked on the screen. She asked him if she should pull ""her"" from the plane. She then closed the door and locked it. He stood there as if I should just walk off gingerly. I debated with him about why their antics were bad business and his only come back was that I should have checked in earlier. I said like 90 minutes earlier like I tried to do. Not everyone can be at the gate 2 hours prior to a flight. This is 2016 - that's what technology is for which American Airlines is obviously struggling with. Not to mention customer service. I called customer service again, this time speaking to an agent who was nice but obviously thought her level of kindness was equaled by my ignorance. She put me on hold for a few minutes after hearing my story and has the audacity to come back and say I got you on the 8:15 flight. I asked the flight I'm already on after getting dumped on by your company? She said it's the least I can do. I said what about a refund or a voucher or waiving the $75 I had to pay for a flight you gave my seat away on which had I known was going to happen would have never changed to? She said I'm afraid I can't do anything sir. This is all comical now but being a business guy I can see huge inefficiencies in operations and customer service. So in all honesty I would not fly American Airlines. I know I won't. There are too many other options - companies who wouldn't treat their customers in this manner."
2220,"Flight in First from LaGuardia to Miami with American Airlines. Flight was 2 hours late, all flights that evening were delayed due to wind. We were notified via the AA app 4 hours in advance, and kept updated via the app and the gate agent. Boarding was quick, pre flight drink served. Two good natured flight attendants worked the cabin, smiling and pleasant despite grumpy passengers. Warm nuts, drinks, a full meal, and a warm cookie to top it off. Honestly I don't get all the negative comments that American gets, I think they provide an above average service and a usually the cheapest ticket on the route. My trip on them was excellent."
2221,"Newark to Phoenix with American Airlines.Despite increasing negative reviews about AA we chanced the carrier as last minute plans were made. What an epic disaster. We were scheduled to leave Newark at 1:40. We proceeded to leave the gate some what on time. No sooner were we taxiing back to the gate without an explanation until 20 minutes later when we were told about electronic problem. On our flight which lasted over 7-hours we received a bag of stale mini pretzels. As we approached Phoenix airport we circled for 30 minutes without any updates from the captain. We then began to pick up speed and told we were headed to Palm Springs because there was not enough fuel to continue circling. We finally land at our diversion site in Palm Springs where we proceed to sit on the runway for an hour because there are no AA agents to assist us at a gate. Not once are we offered beverage or snack. After over an hour we finally depart back to Phoenix with again no regular updates from cockpit. Yes, customer service has taken a hit in the industry but AA takes the cake. They should be ashamed of their product. Also, absolutely terrible and spotty wifi. And no inflight entertainment on a cross country flight. 10 + hours later. Disgusting"
2222,"  DCA to LAX, as a domestic connection to a Cathay Pacific international flight. Check-in was prompt, and I accessed the Admiral's Club Lounge due to my One World Emerald Tier membership with British Airways. Staff at DCA were efficient, and some quite friendly. Boarding and in-flight service was very good. Meal and beverage service was adequate for domestic First Class these days, and the aircraft was a newer Boeing 737-800 with leather seats and the sky interior lighting. Good safety demonstration video, and a smooth, on-time flight with good information from the crew. My bags needed to be re-checked at Cathay Pacific due to their flight being the following day, but LAX staff took a while to send them to the carousel. The only things I missed in-flight were a foot/leg rest in the seat, and the lack of a GIS flight map on the TV monitors. Overall, I was very satisfied with this flight. My return flight was via ORD to DCA 12 days later, and was comparable, despite the aircraft being an older Boeing 737-800 with the fabric interior."
2223,"  
Flew American Airlines from Edinburgh to New JFK. What a thoroughly disappointing experience in a very tired aircraft. No screen in the back of the seats, no choice of movies to watch, one movie the whole trip as the inbound movie wouldn't play and no explanation was given as to why. Food very poor and cramped seats. Staff pretty miserable and scarce on our night flight, poor choice of free drinks and overpriced snacks. Booked the whole trip through British Airways so expected better. What a let down."
2224," Manchester to Philadelphia with American Airlines. Was a little worried about flying AA having read these reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. Plane a little dated. Departed a little late but made up the time enroute. Crew very helpful, inflight entertainment good and food and wine very good. Arrival process smooth and quick which is always a bonus when arriving in the US but I still don't know why immigration officials are so rude. Overall, a good flight."
2225," Miami to Los Angeles with American Airlines. I did not really fly their ""Premium Economy"" but I count the ""Main Cabin Extra"" to be that because it is still economy class seats with few premium perks. I got bumped to MCE for free at the gate upon request, and it was super comfortable, best part it was the emergency exit row, I was able to sleep well and it is seldom that I sleep on flights. The cabin crew were friendly and chatty, had two rounds of snacks service, flight arrived before time. Will definitely fly them again in future."
2226," Grand Cayman to Miami with American Airlines. Improvement noted is the first thing I'd like to say. Compared to my previous bad experiences with AA this one seemed better. The cabin crew were friendly, the flight departed on time, the seat was comfortable but the legroom was bad. Short flight across to Miami from Cayman, got biscoff and drinks, which was fair enough. The IFE had good music to keep me tuned for the hour, the staff in Cayman handling the baggage drop-off was too slow and it really defeats the purpose of baggage drop."
2227,"San Francisco to Newport via Philadelphia. Horrible customer service, in fact we were flat out lied to multiple times. Checked in at San Francisco and were not informed that our connecting flight had been overbooked. Rather, we were told that we just didn't have a seat assignment yet and would get one as soon as we checked in at the gate. Once we checked at gate they kept telling us that we would be called up soon, again no mention of flight being overbooked. It was only after they had boarded the plane and I asked agent directly three times if we had a seat on the plane that she said ""doesn't look good"". She then finally admitted that the flight was overbooked. Per their stated overbooking policy, they are supposed to ask for volunteers which never happened. In this case the agents also seemed incompetent at counting because after we continued to complain she went on the plane to look and ""found"" 2 open seats. She then followed behind us screaming ""Run! Run!"" as we walked to board the plane. That part I found especially ridiculous as we had been waiting at the ticket counter for over an hour trying to sort this out and it was the agent who waited until the last minute to be truthful and act. Will avoid American Airlines at all cost in the future."
2228,"  
Would never book with American Airlines again. Was due to fly from Dallas Fort Worth to Jackson. Two minutes before boarding the plane, the flight was cancelled because a pilot could not be located. During this time the remaining crew was exiting the plane, since the head pilot was MIA. The next flight was completely booked, and my next option was flying out the next morning. Well I needed to be at my destination (hence the reason I booked that date), so I requested a full refund a drove 7 hours to my location. This was my first experience flying and they completely ruined it. I understand flights get cancelled or delayed, but don't they locate other pilots? Boarding time was 4.25, take off was 4.55, they cancelled at 4.23."
2229," Toronto to Newburgh via Philadelphia with American Airlines. I have flown many times using AA but one common problem is there is always flight delays. I have never gone on a trip where this airline makes it on time. This time going to Newburgh the delay in PHL was couple of hours. Coming back the delay was few hours in Newburgh which would have made me miss my connecting flight to YYZ so I had to sleep a night in Newburgh. In the morning the flight was again delayed so I had to get a later connection in which case my other ticket to Winnipeg was wasted as I missed my flight. I was suppose to come back to Toronto on Wednesday and fly to Winnipeg on Thursday, but because of this delay, I missed the flight. The 2 tickets were bought separately so I could not do anything."
2230,"Phoenix to Redmond/Bend with American Airlines. Just an awful experience. Not sure why I fly this airline. Delayed more than an hour. No real updates. On the flight my tray table was broken, WiFi out of service and awful coffee. And now I sit knowing I'm getting home an hour late or more with work tomorrow."
2231,"Philadelphia to Boston with American Airlines. I often see folks complaining about airline. The days of being pampered went out with the Pam Am Clippers, unless you are paying $$$$$ for the plane with the shower and bar. The objective is to get you there safely. Yes, I have sat next to the 400lb man who was half in my seat or next to the woman who took her shoes off and planted her smelly feet on the bulkhead. American Airlines is my carrier of choice. I fly 100,000+ miles a year with them. Are they perfect, no. But in my experience, you get out of it, what you put into it. Instead of looking for a problem or gripe, try making the best out of it. You have over 100 unique personalities crammed into an aluminum tube at 35,000 ft. Meet the flight crews half way and you will find 99% of the time you will be just fine."
2232,"  During a flight last week from Los Angeles to Boston, the passenger in front of me had a small dog. Instead of putting the dog in its carrier, the woman petted the dog, and passed it back and forth to another passenger across the isle several times during the 5+ hour flight. One of the flight attendants even carried the dog up to the front of the plane so that the other attendants could pet it. The dog was not a service dog. I have severe allergies, I and several other passengers nearby began coughing and sneezing. When I mentioned to FA's that this was against AA's pet policy, they claimed to be unfamiliar with the policy. I have been on many, many flights with dogs and cats, and never once complained. With the exception of service dogs, which laid quietly on the floor, all other pets remained in their cases under the seat. I took allergy medicine and was able to manage my symptoms. This is the only flight I have ever been on where a pet has been allowed to be loose and to be handled in such a way. I contacted Customer Relations, expecting to have them apologize, and received a meaningless, copy-and-paste response. The response does not indicate in any way that they understand the  issue, recognize that their own policies were not followed, or have any intention of addressing the situation in any way. I tried calling customer service, but got referred back to Customer Relations, who can’t be bothered to provide a phone number. I contacted them over Twitter, but only got a token response. In the absence of other avenues, I reached out directly to the Director of Customer Relations but only received a voicemail back from a lower-level agent, who did not leave a call-back number."
2233,  I made the mistake of flying American Airlines instead of Southwest. I flew from Cincinatti to Dallas DFW (flight 5900) with a connecting flight to San Antonio. The weather was beautiful that day but for some reason our flight was delayed nearly 2 hours in Cincinnati. This delay resulted in many individuals missing their connecting flights. I missed mine but was one of the lucky ones to get on the last flight out of DFW. Others had to spend the night in Dallas. I was not impressed with the lack of urgency or concern for customers. One of the flight attendants actually told one of the patrons she should have made back up plans to get to get to Tulsa. Another individual gave up an earlier over booked flight to miss his connection. The entire experience was horrible.
2234,"Tampa to Grenada via Miami. Traveling on American Airlines is terrible. They have an app that allows you to check-in before you get to the airport. We did this, but when we went to drop off our bags, they sent us to one of about 30 kiosks with poorly written software that wasted 20 minutes of our time just to print out a bag tag. You then have to walk up to a clerk who then weighs your bag, checks your ticket and ID all over again. Why do we have to do the same exact thing twice? Total waste of time. Once we were on the plane, we were excited to see that there were TVs with movies, tv shows, etc available. However, the pilot and attendants interrupt the screens whenever they speak over the microphone, and they play through your headphones at inexcusable volume. Each time they came over the loudspeaker, you could look around and everyone was ripping their earphones out of their ears. This was at least twice an hour on a 3 hour flight. On the 3 hour flight, you can have 1 drink but no snacks are provided. I know that flying isn't luxurious in economy class, but they make everything more annoying and complicated than needed. They have a video they play in the beginning of your flight that says ""we know you have a choice when you fly, so thank you for flying American Airlines"". I actually didn't have a choice, and if they are my only option ever again, I'll skip the trip."
2235,"  Miami to Monterrey. After living 8-years overseas in Europe and Latin America, it is such a terrible shock coming back to the ""joy"" of US flagship airlines. Realistically, there aren't any that compare to most serious international carriers. In the US, we have come to accept incredibly poor service as adequate. That said, American seems to find new and creative ways to disappoint and underperform. Whether it is customer service, aircraft maintenance, or just about any other aspect. They just cannot seem to get it right. Do they try to be this bad? Or are employees so disgruntled that they have stopped caring at all?!"
2236,"Trying to get to Denver today. I am holding a ticket for a Charlotte to Denver flight, connecting thru Phoenix. I get to the airport 3 hours prior to departure and attempt to get on a direct flight to Denver (standby) which has open seats only to be told that ""American's Policies don't allow me to fly stand by"". Makes a lot of sense, the diecty flight has open seats and American could possibly use my original seat (thru Phoenix) in case of an over booking. Status is out the door."
2237,"Vancouver to Cabo San Lucas via Phoenix. My wife and our 1 year old daughter flew from Vancouver BC to Phoenix and then to Cabo Mexico. Round trip, we had 4 flights on this airline. Not once did they call families with young children to board first. We were in group 4 everytime because we were unable to check in online since we were travelling with an infant. Therefore we had to board last and bother everyone as we tried to settle in with our baby. Both connecting flights out of Phoenix were delayed. One for 30 minutes, the other for over an hour. Our flight home from Phoenix was delayed even longer due to a computer issue with the tower. During this time, NO flight attendant offered us water or anything to help with our baby. The cabin was very stuffy and hot and uncomfortable, and no one came by our row to help make things easier for us. The flight attendants were short with us and were bitchy towards each other, complaining about days off etc. I understand that some things are uncontrollable while traveling, but the staff should be trained better to deal with these situations. We don't plan on travelling with American Airlines ever again!"
2238,"From the time I go online to make a reservation to the time the flight is over, the entire experience is terrible. I try to fly just 2 airlines to maximize acquiring miles/points for upgrades, and the other airline, which I thought was lacking, is far superior to American Airlines. The route timings, fares, equipment, in-flight service - everything is sub-standard and makes traveling more burdensome than it has to be. On this last flight to/from Cap Haitien, Haiti, my entertainment did not function! It is always something with AA."
2239,  Los Angeles to Boston. Was very unhappy with the way my luggage was handled. This was a full flight and they were asking passengers from groups 3 and 4 to check their bags. That overhead bins were full and all luggage of groups 3 and 4 must be checked. As group 2 I expected to be fine but had my luggage taken away from me at the gate. As I proceeded to board I saw that there was plenty of overhead space for my luggage which was now checked. My designated seat bin was completely empty and I am very unhappy with being forced to check my bag when there was still room for it. And I was not even in the group that was said to need to check their bags.
2240,"I booked a flight from Salt Lake City to Long Beach with one stop in Phoenix before getting home. I received a call from American Airlines Customer Service advising me the plane to Long Beach was canceled until tomorrow morning, but would comp my hotel, taxi, dinner and breakfast for the inconvenience. I get to Phoenix and the CSR can't give me anything and has no idea what I'm taking about. Now they are saying they cant help me. My 70 year old mother in law slept in a airport terminal for over 10 hours with nothing because she thought she was going to be taken care of. American Airlines is a bunch of crooks."
2241,"On September 30th my husband and I were flying from St Thomas USVI to Miami. During this flight we were stuck on the tarmac until 8pm due to weather. The pilot on that flight assured us all flights were delayed due to lightning. Once we deplaned we realized our connecting flight departure to Detroit was delayed but only by 20 minutes. We rushed to our connecting flight’s gate and arrived to see it still at the gate but the ticket agent told us the doors were closed and we could not board. We were to go to an area within the airport to re-book our flight home. That was when I noticed on the screen at the ticket counter a list of people requesting upgrades to first class. At least 2 names had checks next to them on the screen, which meant our first class tickets had been sold even though we were checked in all the way through to our final destination and delayed only due to weather. During the re-booking process we were told we could not fly out until the following day and those flights, yes multiple stops to get home, would not be first class as we had paid for on our original flight. We were told Customer Service would contact us within 2 – 3 business days to resolve the issue. As of today, October 19, 2016 we still have not received a phone call. I called back to speak with Customer Service and was told I could not call them directly I would have to await a call back. The problem was not that we were unable to fly first class - the problem is that we paid for first class, our seats were sold to other travelers and we were not offered a credit or reimbursement for the difference. As a matter of fact, we were never contacted at all."
2242,"My wife and I were flying from New Jersey to Key West Florida via Miami. Our plane was delayed and American notified us the night before. Because the delay would make us miss our connection, American put us automatically on another flight. We then decided to drive from Miami to Key West because the new plane was going to be much later in the day. American than refunded us for that part of the trip without a problem. Customer service was great (no begging to get refund or rework flight). Overall, even though the plane was delayed by many hours, American made every effort to make sure we were going to get to our destination. Very impressed."
2243,"New York JFK to San Francisco with American Airlines. A truly excellent flight. AA transcon in premium cabins is very good. The first class seat is top grade lie flat with credenza (actually the same seat as is used in C class on Cathay, AF (some planes) and AA (some planes) on international routes. Service was very good. Food was excellent. A superb smoked salmon starter, arugula salad, and a lobster roll main course. Sundae dessert. Each course was first rate and well presented and served. Movie selection excellent. Screen was very large with high resolution. I don't know of any other domestic US service this good."
2244,"  Lawton, Oklahoma to Detroit, Michigan via DFW. American Airlines always has an excuse, always has maintenance issues and never comps their passengers for delayed, cancelled, or rerouted planes. We not only sat in the airport for 5 hours, with no vending machines, no food options, and a city that wouldn't even deliver food to the airport, but was treated very rudely because we ask questions about the flight. This airline needs to be shut down until they get their issues corrected! This is absolutely ridiculous, every time we fly American Airlines. "
2245,"  My flight from the Cayman islands to New York flew via Charlotte was cancelled in Charlotte. I was offered no assistance or direction in finding accommodation for the night; no food, no entertainment and absolutely nowhere to sleep. That was frustrating, but not the end of the world. Next is what continues to frustrate me. American Airlines lost my luggage for the entire week I spent in New York - it was not until I got back to England that i received my bag. I had to call every night I was there to get any information on the current status of my bag, which was mostly mixed advice and nobody with any idea what was going on. Now, 2 months later I find myself having to call them every week to get anything done. I sent them all the receipts from my purchases. A month following this they agree to pay, it's been another month and they continue to spell my email address wrong, lose most of my correspondence and never do anything without a call. The amount of time I have spent on hold with AA could be measured in days. They are very openly making it as difficult as possible for me to get my money back in the hope I will give up. I have never had such a drawn out and consistently awful experience. I don't think anyone reads anything I send before they reply with something generic and unhelpful, then I call and have to guide them through their own job. As soon as I hang up they ignore me and my case once more. Don't risk flying with them, they don't care about their customers or reputation anymore."
2246,"  Los Angeles to Miami. I am writing this message at the end of my 3rd straight failed flight attempt with American. Hopefully American learn something from my poor experience and use that to create a better experience for the next guy.  On Tuesday 4 October I knew the flight I was originally on for Thursday 6 October was going to get screwed up due to the impending hurricane so I tried to be proactive and call American. I was charged ~$720 to change the flight to Wednesday 5 October. My friend who was also on that same flight, waited until hours later to change his flight. Since a weather alert was issued, he was charged $0 to change his flight. Now you would think that American would be happy that I was proactive and allowed them to be organized, but when I called in and asked for a refund since I thought it was ridiculous that I was charged ~$720 for being proactive, my request naturally was rejected.  On Monday  10 October I was booked on flight AA68 leaving at 10:30am. The flight was delayed because there was an oil leak. The original flight was postponed to Tuesday 11 October, however we offered a free transfer to a different flight taking off at 3 pm (4.5 hours later). As a reparation, we were offered food that had already been expired (see picture 1). Finally after boarding the flight, I was given a seat with a defective television screen so I had to stare at a screen with inverted colors while the rest of my flight was able to enjoy a movie. Fortunately, this gave me plenty of time to think about what an awful job American has done on my last 3 flights. American Airlines has just come off of a record year making $7.6 billion dollars. The last two times I've worked with American I gave them roughly $2,000 worth of business. Everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong. Every single flight was delayed, I was fed expired food, I was charged over $700 to change a flight before a natural disaster that you allowed other clients to change for free. The behavior of American has been completely unacceptable."
2247,"Norfolk to Orlando. My husband and  I booked American through Cheap Flights.com and I have never regretted a reservation like I have this one. First, on our flight to Florida, we had to cancel and rebook our flight on the day of FIVE times. We were never notified that our original flight was cancelled, and even once we signed up for alerts, no one ever called me to rebook flights. We finally got a flight out as we were dropping off friends at the airport and checked with the American ticketer, for a flight an hour from that time. Thankfully, our family was able to bring our packed luggage but we had to undo cancellations for our hotel, find a completely different car rental, and did not arrive in Florida until 1 AM. That, however, pales in comparison to today. We got up at 3 for our 5.15 flight, only to find at the airport that flight had been ""cancelled"" and we were moved to a 6.35 flight, with unassigned seats and are currently waiting assignment. This is so unacceptable and unprofessional, I am at a loss for words. The individuals who work here are wonderful, but the company is terrible. This is a deplorable excuse for customer service and I will be filing a complaint with the company for their subpar ""commitment"" to their customers."
2248,"  Boeing 767-300 from London to Chicago, the first and probably last transatlantic flight with the. We chose the flight as it arrived in O'hare the earliest and suited our itinerary - bad choice. Equipment was a very dated 767-300. Tired, dated cabin, no back of seat Avod entertainment, overhead video screens - no choice you either watch the rubbish on that, read or watch your iPad - no wireless either so you can't utilise inflight Gogo even if you did no inseat power. Even the staff know the plane is dated. Breakfast awful and some 4 hrs into the flight still no further trolley service  - in fact only saw staff was when the fasten seat belt light came on and they had to check seat belts were fastened. This continued with a portion of ice cream and glass of water at 4 hrs into flight. No drinks service, no further food, no snacks until 7.5 hrs into the flight when you are served or I should say passed a Monty's hot box that purports to be grilled cheese and danish - but is in fact inedible.  Longest 9 hrs of my life even flying Transatlantic on a 757 with United had more choice and better service and that's saying something.  American Airlines don't care for their customers and it shows - the product is a total joke."
2249,  Great flight with American Airlines to Dallas on the new 787-9 aircraft. It was the certification flight and second leg back to Dallas. Sat in the new premium economy seat and can say that they have picked a very good seat. Very comfortable and good amount of space. Premium economy service doesn't start until November so just had economy food and wine. But crew were good and plane was excellent. American are going to fit the new seats into the A330 aircraft first and then new B777 and refit aircraft. B787-8 will be the last to get them.
2250,"Return fights booked by Travel Agent with British Airways - operated by Aer Lingus Cork to Heathrow and then American Airlines direct from Heathrow to Raleigh Durham, NC. Told by AA staff at Heathrow that direct flight cancelled. Re-routed to JFK followed by 5 hour wait for connecting flight to Raleigh. No apology from AA. Explained I had twisted my ankle at Cork Airport and asked if we could have comfortable seats  (accompanying my 84 year old mother). The lady responded by booking us into the last row (40) on the plane next to the toilets! We had paid €2,000 for our flights. Food horrendous and inedible. Will never travel with American Airlines or British Airways long haul again."
2251,"Worst travel experience of my life. After a connecting flight from Birmingham, Alabama to Miami we waited for 10 hours to be told that our flight to Brazil was being cancelled due to ""pilot fatigue"". American never offered to put us in a hotel even though it was Wednesday and there were no flights out until Friday afternoon. After making it to Brazil and having a very nice trip we make it back to the airport only to find that all flights have been cancelled. We spend one more night in Brazil and go back to the airport the next day to find that there is no scheduled flight back. They have been nothing but dishonest. Very disappointed. We will never be flying with them again."
2252,"  
Flight from Los Angeles LAX to Sao Paulo (GRU ) on business. Departure on time. Very good equipment, Boeing 787-900. There s no first class. Business is on row 1. Very comfortable seats, 180 reclining. Very good inflight entertainment, including new films and wifi (paid USD 20,00 ). Meals were OK, Nothing special. Arrived on time at LAX. Would fly again with AA, but ONLY in this aircraft and only in business"
2253,"When we booked our flights several months ago there was not a direct flight from Charlotte to Albany so we booked via Chicago, recognizing how circuitous and inconvenient it would be. When we arrived at the Charlotte airport for our flight home to Albany we noticed that there was a direct flight to Albany and were told that there were many seats available. We asked if we could be out I that flight but at every turn were told that it was against company policy and that such a change would cost $200 each. We realize what ""the policy"" is but were hoping in a rationale, customer focused world we could get on a flight with vacancies that was going directly to Albany rather than having to fly halfway across the country only to return to the east coast. Of course the rationale is that the direct flight ""might"" have cost less than the flight we booked. When I asked for a comparison of the costs of the 2 flights at the time we booked it the airline said there was no way they could tell. Even though many airlines look for every conceivable angle to make money off their customers it's a shame that American assumes the same pecuniary motives from their customers. And so a flight to Albany with plenty of empty seats will leave soon. We won't be on it. But we will be on the flight leaving at a nearby gate to Chicago and once there we will hop a flight to Albany. Bureaucratic policies which focus solely on the bottom line rather than on the customer ultimately will damage the bottom line. Next time we will go through great lengths to fly Southwest where the customer and their free baggage are still held in esteem."
2254,"  Flying AA2315 from Miami to New Orleans. Boarding was around two hours late because there were apparently some problems with the aircraft that needed fixing. But the ground staff was very kind and the passengers were even offered some complimentary snacks and drinks as a compensation. A very nice gesture by American Airlines. The flight itself was a pretty standard US domestic flight. Passengers were offered some drinks and crackers. Cabin crew was very friendly and service was fast. The seats were not was spacious as I hoped for, I (1.80 metres) did not feel very comfortable, but as this was a short flight, it was no big problem for me. There was Wi-Fi provided for the whole flight, but it was rather expensive. You could visit the American Airlines website for free however. Overall a fairly standard US domestic flight with some very friendly ground staff and cabin crew."
2255,"  San Antonio to San Diego via Phoenix. Both flights were to schedule and boarding very smooth. Wi-Fi was provided but somewhat expensive. Cabin crew was very friendly and service was fast. Passengers were served drinks and crackers. The planes were very clean. The CRJ900 had some very comfortable and spacious seats with plenty of leg room. I was pleasantly surprised. The A321 had the normal leg room you would expect on a short-haul flight. Overall a very pleasant journey, very friendly staff and everything was on time. I cannot think about something bad about those flights."
2256,"Tampa to Washington DC. I always fancied myself a pretty savvy guy, but an American Airlines customer service rep just bamboozled me good. I just called to change a ticket because I couldn't reach the airport (there's a hurricane between here and Tampa). They charged me $157 for the ""difference"" in ticket costs, plus a $200 fee for changing the ticket. On a hunch I just checked their website. I could have bought a one way ticket on the same flight for almost half a much as they just charged me. Don't believe a word  their reps say. They are out to fleece you, not help you."
2257," Reno to Chicago via Phoenix with American Airlines. PHX-ORD, in First (upgrade due to Platinum status) and Economy, PHX-ORD. Both flights were former US services. Self service kiosks and bag drop fast and hassle free. TSA in RNO fast, friendly and efficient. Boarding at RNO was fast and orderly. Short PHX-LAS hop on an A319 in First with beverage service only, due to the short duration of the flight and adequate. Boarding in PHX was less organized and slightly chaotic as different gate attendants were giving contradicting boarding instructions. Seats on the PHX-ORD leg (A321) were comfortable for Economy and leg room excellent due to exit row seat. This time only one beverage service on this 3+ hour flight. As per usual alcohol and snacks for sale, but items on sale did not look appealing and rather overpriced. FA’s not unprofessional, but uninterested and service obviously limited to the absolute minimum required; quite a different experience to last month’s flight ORD-PHX with a much better crew. No IFE available, but not an issue for this flight duration. On time arrival in ORD, but after a long walk to baggage claim, some additional wait for the bags to arrive. However, overall waiting time was still on the acceptable side. Priority bags came out whenever and my second bag was one of last to arrive. I was actually already thinking that it did not make it to ORD. Flights on time and no drama so that was good, but a distinctly average experience overall."
2258," Chicago to Las Vegas via Phoenix with American Airlines. Economy, ORD-PHX) and First, PHX-LAS (upgrade due to Platinum status). Both flights were former US services. Planes have been redesigned with AA colors, but had the original US seat plan (no main cabin extra) and staff was wearing US uniforms. Self service kiosks and bag drop fast, hassle free and agents were reasonably friendly. Also, TSA quite fast and efficient, which was a surprise for ORD. Boarding at both ORD and PHX orderly and efficient. Service on board both flights professional and friendly, with the FA’s regularly present in the cabin. Uniforms of the FA’s were on the “relaxed” side on both legs. Plane (A321) on the ORD-PHX leg modern and packed, but seats were comfortable for Economy and leg room excellent due to exit row seat. One beverage service and one water run on this 3+ hour flight. As per usual alcohol and snacks for sale, but items on sale did not look appealing and rather overpriced. No IFE available, but not an issue for this flight duration. Communication from flight deck was kept to the absolute minimum and was not particularly friendly. Early arrival into PHX. Nothing extraordinary or great, but happy to say this was an overall pleasant experience for Economy. Short PHX-LAS hop in First with beverage service only, due to the short duration of the flight and adequate. Initial announcement from the captain was made from the front of cabin, which was a nice gesture. This A320 was clearly an older plane, but seemed well maintained and clean. On time arrival in LAS. Waiting time for bags reasonable and priority bags were out first. Overall, flights were pleasant without being anything special, but definitely one of the better experiences I had on domestic flights in the U.S. recently. Recommended, based on this experience."
2259,"Chicago to Manchester with American Airlines. Worst flight ever. Route was and is advertised with personal entertainment system choice of movies etc. Plane advertised as 787. Instead what we got was a 30 year old 767 that still had its original interior. 6 screens on the centre ceiling that you needed binoculars to see. The seats were very uncomfortable as they were the same age as the aircraft. I asked the staff if the plane was a joke, he said it was a last resort plane as they had technical issues with the Dreamliner, which I since found out was untrue. According to AA customer service the flight was changed several weeks earlier and is still being used to date as they said in their words ""we used this aircraft because it was more profitable"". The fact that it is advertised with all the mod cons did not concern them at all. The magazine in the seat pocket was all stuck together and some of them were totally in Spanish. The movie was a Disney movie and the people who made the outbound journey on this flight said the movie was in Spanish and could not be changed. The flight was unable to carry any duty free items as they didn't have anywhere to store it. AA customer service offered us a voucher for $100 off our next flight but like I told them ""Why would we ever fly with them again on a 30 year old aircraft when there are far superior carriers out there that actually give you what you pay for?"" Will never fly this airline again, which is a shame as it was the first time with AA and we were so looking forward to it."
2260,San Francisco to Minneapolis with American Airlines. I was placed on standby for a flight I had already paid for and as I was unable to get a seat I missed an important work function. This was only the beginning. There were no other flights going out that day. I called American Airlines in the hope of resolving this issue and figure out the next available time in which I could get to my destination. I sat on hold for 40 min and less than a minute into the conversation the call was disconnected. They made no attempt to reconnect with me. Consequently I was forced to call back. Sat on hold for another 40 plus mins. The representative did nothing in order to help me resolve this issue. Her solution was for me to purchase another ticket. This did not seem to be a customer friendly solution. As a last resort to find a mutually beneficial and reasonable solution to my situation I asked to speak with the manager. The manager refused to speak with me. I was under the impression that as a manager one of your responsibilities is to ensure there customers are happy. Or at very least take the time out to speak with the customer whom you are providing a service for.
2261,"If you are flying somewhere with connecting flights, this is not the airline for you. I paid $525 dollars to get from Gainesville, Florida to Maruqette, Michigan. I got delayed in Charlotte two times to Chicago and then both flights got cancelled. I ended up getting to Chicago past midnight where I had to sit in the airport until 3 AM where I asked to speak to a supervisor. It took her over ten minutes to come in which she proceeded to stand over in a corner and stare at everyone until one of the customer service representatives had to go remind her that I was waiting for her. When she comes over and I tell her what's going on, she denies me assistance because ""she can only help me if one of the customer assistance ladies can't help me."" Then she rudely told me, ""I'm going to direct you to the line behind you to speak to a customer representative."" After walking into the line and waiting I was speaking to the lady about rebooking my flight to Marquette. Marquette was full that day and I would have been number 13 on standby. So my options were either take a plane to Greenbay (which is 3 hours from Marquette) or wait another 36 hours in an airport to fly to Marquette. Obviously my hands were tied and I chose to go to Greenbay. I was put on standby for an 8:40 AM flight and confirmed on a flight at noon. I sat in the airport until 8 and by this point I had been up over 24 hours. The flight at 8:40 was a bit delayed, and I waited until almost everyone boarded before approaching the boarding assistant and asking them if there were any seats available for people on standby. She asked for my name, I gave it to her, and she told me I wasn't on the standby list. I showed her my ticket proving I was and she denied still that I was on the standby list. She then proceeded to ignore me for a few minutes before closing the flight, telling me she can't help me, and walked away. I needed to get on that flight because I had no way of getting from Marquette to Greenbay except for a friend who could pick me up if I had gotten on the earlier flight. I end up going up to some other people who worked at American Airlines and asked for a supervisor. They asked what the problem was and I told them. They kept telling me I wasn't on the standby list and there was nothing they could do. They ended up telling me to ""go away because there's nothing they can do to help me."" When I finally got to speak to a supervisor, she told me I ended up getting confirmed on the 8:40 flight and there was no way for me to know. This means that their worker neglected to check if I was confirmed and forced me to miss my flight for no reason other than pure laziness. When I finally get to Greenbay, I ask the supervisor there to get me to Marquette somehow. He just shrugged and told me ""he can't help me because I said it was okay for them to get me to Greenbay."" My hands were tied, I had no choice. I ended up having to rend a car for $200 and driving 3 hours sleep deprived to finally get to my destination. So while I had to pay $525 for my ticket, I ended up having to pay a total of $725 just to get to my destination.  This airline does not care about their customers and will do as least as possible for you. I spoke to four different supervisors at three different airports and only one was kind and tried to help me. Do not fly this airline if you can help it because I never will again."
2262,"I am a weekly business traveler who switched over to flying American in 2014 and haven't switched back. American has truly redesigned its product, services and staff to be top notch. The US airways folks that are transitioning still need work but the American staff, crew, planes are the best out there. The staff and service have changed the game in domestic US Travel and their international product on the 777-300 leaves British Airways (also oneworld) in the dust. If you are flying to London and are a BA frequent like myself choose AA operated flight you will see the difference. American is now my only choice in travel. Try the LAX-JFK or SFO to JFK or LAX-LHR product and I guarantee you will never fly another airline."
2263,"  American Airlines flight 73 from Los Angeles to Sydney. I was pleasantly surprised with the level of service provided on this flight. They step their game up a notch on his international route to be more in line with Qantas. I would say they are at least on par with Qantas if not a little better in economy. The food was good. I had steak with red wine sauce, mashed potatoes and broccoli for dinner. Snack was a pizza pocket type thing. And breakfast was eggs, tomato, bacon and mushroom. The IFE operating system works smoothly and is more responsive. However I would say Qantas has a better selection. Americans ""new release"" section is not that extensive. Overall I was happy."
2264,Dallas DFW to Las Vegas with American Airlines. My flight was delayed 4 different times changing my arrival time drastically which is the most important part of my trip due to personal reasons and is the only reason I choose this flight. I was also forced to check my bag at gate due to the fact they ran out of overhead space within the first 2 boarding groups. Over all extremely displeased with this airline and will not be returning.
2265,"Baltimore to Buffalo via Philadelphia. Flight arrived 1h 30min late at Philadelphia. Lost the connection (last flight at 8pm). American Airlines proposed next flight at 7 am next morning. Arrived to the airport at 5:30am and flight cancelled without any explanation! Customer assistance not able to propose another flight (no seat available) to Buffalo, Toronto or Rochester. Business class tickets (quite expensive) for nothing and an important meeting missed at Buffalo. Thank you American Airlines!"
2266,"Buenos Aires to London Heathrow via New York JFK with American Airlines. Ground staff excellent at all airports. Very good seating, comfortable, good entertainment. Cabin staff seemed to be doing the passenger a favour serving meals etc. Welcome sparkling wine in plastic cups, no drinks refill offered and no coffee, tea etc after meals. Polite but not going overboard with the service. If you have to connect at JFK allow at least 3 hours to be able to endure the unacceptably long immigration lines and change terminals."
2267,"Tampa to Lynchburg via Charlotte with American Airlines. Flight was cancelled twice due to maintenance issues (over-fueling). Poor costumer service representatives - they were degrading and rude. Overall the sardine can of a plane was uncomfortable. On the positive side, they did provide us with a hotel for the cancellation, but no meal vouchers. Not impressed. Will not be flying AA again."
2268,"London Heathrow to Southwest Florida via Charlotte. This was a codeshare flight with BA and although a little disappointed flying with AA, it wasn't that bad at all. Clean and tidy A333 leather seats and more space than the BA equivalent. Took off on time. Individual IFE screens that were a bit temperamental  and the selection of films/TV or music was fine. Crew at the back were pleasant and efficient. Food one veggie and one meat selection and free beer or wine, then an ice cream half way across. Toilets clean, the only downside was this awful snack at the end - why waste the money give us a Mars bar or something rather some fancy coconut bacon slice. So I couldn't fault the cross Atlantic leg. CLT to RSW nice clean A321, again flight crew were efficient whipped through the plane with snacks and soft drinks ( unless you wanted to pay). During the flight had a nose bleed and the crew were great, ice tissues and care immediately. Summary all on time, good crew, clean planes, almost a completely edible inflight food. what more could you want"
2269,"  
Another uneventful on time departure and early arrival on American Airlines. Flight was full to DFW and seat 7A was a good choice being a bulk head in main cabin extra for the 3 hour trip. 1 beverage service and 1 pack of pretzels served. Boarded with group 2 so there was plenty of overhead space which is needed/required for the bulk head seats. Entertainment was on BYOD (download the app in advance as it was slow on board). Its the gogo entertainment app not the AA app that unfortunately I downloaded in error. Cabin crew were very friendly and chatty too."
2270,"San Diego to Tampa via Dallas. The crew in Dallas were the only redeeming factor. Flight from San Diego delayed/cancelled leaving at least 100 people to miss their connecting flights in Dallas. It happens. AA Airport staff were rude beyond anything I have ever seen (we re-routed by phone instead of waiting on line for 2 hours, and were successful on 3rd call. First two in essence sad sorry about your luck). It took us 21 hrs to return from San Diego to Tampa. An AA employee told a couple in a very annoyed voice ""Sir, I just came over here to get away from those people and their endless questions. Why don't you come back in ten minutes"". All of the passengers from that flight had already waited patiently for two hours without a word from AA staff. When we finally got a flight to Dallas (not final destination) the cabin crew was clearly not getting along. The young male actually stated about an older stewardess in an annoyed voice (while serving drinks/snacks) ""She is clearly senile"". I was traveling on corporate business. I am no stranger to customer service. This was the worst I have ever seen, and that includes the ""customer service agent"" on site in San Diego. I am not usually this harsh, but wow. In contrast, this mornings (9/24) 7 am flight from Dallas to Tampa had an excellent pilot and crew as well as ground staff for what they have to work with - old planes, antiquated amenities. I must also give a nod to staff on the phone customer service for his pleasant nature and helpfulness. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be enough staff at any counters, which makes it difficult for your good employees to overcome the behavior of those who need to find their bliss elsewhere as working with the public is not their niche."
2271,"Lisbon to Philadelphia. The flight was normal, the crew was nice, food aplenty, and the plane was clean despite being a bit old. The crew cleared the rubbish quite often. What really turned me off was the lack of individual IFE screens - especially for a transatlantic flight of over 7 hours. Last time I had experienced that was some 10 years ago! It's time to update, AA!"
2272,"  The service didn't exist. The plane wasn't stocked for refreshment on its way out like it was supposed to be. The crew didn't want to see or talk to their customers and that includes the pilots. The airports were very inefficient. They did have Wi-fi that was positive but not much positive other than that. I expected much better from American Airlines.  I will never make the mistake of flying them again. Lots of luggage confusion, no help except from one baggage handler in Philly and one airport staff member in Charlotte. The airline looks to be very poorly run and organized."
2273,  Chicago to Orange County. I fly every week for work and I have found that American Airlines is by far the worst airline. Not only is their staff extremely rude but they have delays almost every time I fly. They are inconsistent with policies and constantly give me different information when I call in. It has become such a hassle that I have started taking more expensive or longer flights to avoid using them. Today was the last straw in Chicago O'Hare when customer service was over the top rude. I am 100% all for Delta.
2274,"Flew from Manchester to JFK. The aircraft should have been a 757 but after a delay was changed to a 727. The 757 has seating of 2-3-2 so when changed to a 737 with seating of 3-3 there were not enough seats. The cabin crew were barely polite and you knew they were just going through the motions doing the bare minimum that they had to. After the plane began taxiing the Captain reported that there was a fault with the flaps and would have to return to base where we had to sit on the plane for 2 hours (during which the crew came round with water for the passengers) while they determined that it was an instrument problem and not a physical problem with the flaps so after 3.5 hours delay we managed to take off. As stated before the staff were not exactly rude, just not pleasant and did the bare minimum they had to. The inflight entertainment is non-existant as neither the 737 outbound or the 757 inbound have seat back screens, just the aisle screens which give no choices and showed terrible entertainment. AA must have some of the oldest aircraft in service. I think British Airways have made a terrible mistake teaming up with American Airlines as they certainly do not provide the level of service BA have previously provided. I will not be using American Airlines again."
2275,"  I couldn't just watch a movie on flight AA104 from New York JFK to London Heathrow, the state of the art in-flight entertainment system did not even have the ability to just play a movie. 'Next show in 25 minutes'.  This all occurred on a very dated plane which was changed at last minute we were told by the unpleasant staff at JFK. That meant that the seats we had selected when we checked in online had been given to someone else and we had been assigned seats in the middle row. Tried to change the seats at the gate before boarding as we were instructed to do so by the airline staff upon checking in our bags but dealing with the ground staff at Gate 14 Terminal 8 in JFK was an absolutely shocking experience. The most horrendous level of customer service I have experienced from an airline or any company for that matter! My husband and I will not be flying with American Airlines ever again!"
2276,"San Jose (Costa Rica) to Madrid via Miami and Philadelphia with American Airlines. We have been travelling around the world for over a year and we have taken many different companies. But for an international carrier AA have got to be one of the poorest. Maybe we have been spoilt and if you were to ask me what the main issue was I couldn't point it out. All our flights were on time and our connections were made which was good but I felt the service was just lacking, especially when compared to other international carriers. And it's the little things that I remember. No ear plugs or eye masks, paying $8 for a whisky, typical American advertising over the PA for a credit card. Again, nothing major but just detracted from the whole expereince."
2277,"Washington to Miami. Awful customer service at the check-in point!! We were the first to arrive to the line, we wanted to talk to a person in the counter to let them know we needed someone to escort my grandma and they were terrible. We had to do everything by ourselves, no one gave us directions and the staff were not helpful at all and were very impolite every time we tried to approach them. I'll never fly with them again. Low cost companies would even have better service."
2278,"  I was flying from Providence via Chicago to Flint. The flight out of PVD was delayed a few minutes, and we landed at ORD just a few minutes late. However, AA had no gates available and we pulled to the side of the runway and with the engines off waited over an hour before we were brought to a gate to de-plane. I then missed my connecting flight to FNT. The gate agent sent me out to the ticket counter (it's now 10:00pm) and after waiting nearly 2 hours on line, I was told there were no more flights to FNT today, that the following day was all booked, and that maybe they could get me out 2 days later, maybe to another airport like Midland-Bay City, or Grand Rapids or something. No hotel voucher, no meal voucher, no rebooking, no accommodation, nothing at all: simply put, I was abandoned in mid-journey. They failed to take me to my destination, failed to offer anything and would not issue a refund of any kind, claiming this was a ""weather related"" issue and blame the air traffic controllers. Never again will I fly these losers."
2279,"I purchased tickets months in advance for my partner and I to fly from Tampa to Albany. Both of us were seated together and I checked in right on time. We did not have seats reserved anymore and were seated away from each other on the first flight, and my partner didn't have a seat assigned at all on the second one. I had no choice but to spend $70 just for us to both have seats, when I already paid near $600 for the flights. Will never fly American again. Stick to Delta, I have never had my seats taken away when I checked in 24 hours in advance, ever."
2280,  Dallas/Fort Worth to Hong Kong. This aircraft used was a Boeing 777-300ER with the newly-designed economy class product. The in-flight entertainment system was a great work compared with the last journey from Narita to Los Angeles (AA170). The choices of programmes were rich and updated that I'd watched a total of three movies. The system was also user-friendly since almost all the programmes contained subtitles of various languages. The meal service was satisfactory. A snack service was provided between the two main meals. Flight attendants were also competent that their serving speeds were acceptable and they were willing to serve passengers with drinks before every meal as well as collect trash regularly.
2281,"  I flew from Fresno to Los Angeles on Saturday 10th September. The flight was due to leave at 6:40 but due to LAX being busy we were delayed a long time which meant I would miss my connecting flight from to London - the captain was amazing, he helped me so much he contacted LAX and told them the situation and when we landed at LAX he took me and 3 others to our gate and made sure they waited for us. I was so worried I would miss the flight and he did everything he could to make sure we would make it on time."
2282,  Miami to Denver. Poor customer experience and interactions at gate. I travel extensively and pride myself on packing to never check baggage. I have used same baggage on majority of my flights to include same size American plane from Denver to Miami that I am now returning on. Gentleman at gate picked people to check their bag and there was no consistency. He was rude and was a poor representative for the Airlines.
2283," Baltimore to St Thomas via Charlotte with American Airlines. We had never taken any flights with AA before so we didn't know what to expect. Our flight was scheduled to leave BWI at 8:45am. We arrived at the airport at 6:45am. We boarded our plane at about 8:30 am, we then sat for 2 hours before we were told that we had missed our connecting flight from CLT to St Thomas and there were no more flights leaving and we would have to stay the night. Now this was a problem because we had a nonrefundable reservation at our hotel so we were going to lose a day of our vacation. Eventually, after calling customer service from the plane. We were booked on another flight leaving from Washington DC to Miami. So we get off the plane and take a $100 cab ride for a flight scheduled to leave Dulles at 12:45pm. We get there at about 12:15pm, go through security again, and make it the plane, only to sit on this plane for another 2 hours. Finally we leave and fly to Miami for a flight scheduled to leave a 5:55pm. We're sitting in the airport for 45 minutes and 10 minutes before the flight time they tell us to go to another gate which is in a total different wing of the terminal. So we run to the gate only to find out our 5:55pm flight is delayed. An hour later we board only to sit on yet another plane for almost 2 hours. We made it to St Thomas at 10:30pm. We were originally scheduled to arrive there at 3:30pm. So here we are 16 hours later, and have missed a half a day of our vacation, and AA thinks that was ok. The only thing they could say was oh well, you took the flight, you got there. Our return from St Thomas back home was about the same. Sitting in airports at the wrong gates and delayed flights. In my over 20 years of traveling I have never seen anything like that. This was by far the worst travel experience I've had."
2284,"My husband and I were on a quick trip to Syracuse. His grandmother was in poor health and given weeks left. We flew in on a Friday evening without incident with a return flight beginning on Sunday afternoon from Syracuse to Philadelphia to Wilmington NC. We were left a message at 1145pm on Saturday night that our flight was cancelled. Luckily, we had been up to receive the message and called back 15 minutes later. The American Airlines representative my husband talked to looked for another flight out of Syracuse for about 15 seconds, told him there were none and insisted that we had to drive to Buffalo or Albany if we wanted to fly out Sunday. We were given no explanation for the cancelled flight and the representative refused to look again for any flights out of Syracuse unless we went out Monday instead. So we inquired about a Rochester flight which was our closest option and booked one. Having jobs we had to get back to. My father in law drove us to and from Rochester. Then our flight was delayed because of weather. I understand some things are out of people's control, buy this is the 3rd time we have experienced our flight through Philadelphia being cancelled, being called very late, and having to inconvenience family members. No more quick weekend trips for us."
2285, Lebanon to Washington National via Boston with American Airlines. Layover in Boston required a second trip through TSA. AA has hired an outside company to measure carry on bags to very strict dimensions. A bag I've carried on for 5 years had to be checked for an additional $25 fee. Had no option but to pay. This is extortion plain and simple. No warnings at all prior to the flight. They are surely making a pretty penny off people who are silly enough to fly with them. Who knows what they'll come up with next to gain more from customers they clearly have no respect for.
2286,"New York to Bangor via Philadelphia. A long weekend getaway shortened by delay and cancellations by American Airlines without explanation or customer support. First day of travel, flights were cancelled and rebooked for a morning flight the following day. This meant a first night hotel reservation was unable to be refunded. It also meant the cost of three taxi rides to and from airport d/t the cancellation and then again the following day. Day 2 early morning flight once again, both initial flight and connecting flight, now wasting a full vacation day. Return flight was a repeat of the departure experience with a delay of the initial flight, hourly delays with the connecting flight, and yet another cancellation. Repeated calls to American Airlines, over four weeks, means being transferred to yet another number, only to be told to go online and request refunds, etc. There will be no response to emails. In other words, the phone numbers for customer service serve only as a complaint department to shuffle the customer around only for you to have ones frustration and dissatisfaction grow. Seriously folks, can any of the ""economy"" airlines be worse?"
2287,"Charlotte to New Orleans connecting flight cancelled due to ""air traffic"" although no weather issues were evident in Charlotte and flight from Toronto, though delayed, arrived in time for connection. No further flights that evening - I had to overnight in Charlotte. American Airlines claimed no responsibility because of weather, hotel costs were mine. Airline would not put me on its first flight to New Orleans the next morning, nor reimburse cost of the ticket, nor transfer me to another airline, nor deliver checked bag for the night. Avoid this airline."
2288,"Flew from NYC to Rome toward the end of August, 2016. The flight was delayed by almost 2 hours, because the plane was warm and needed to be cooled down, which was supposed to take a ""few minutes"", but took over an hour to begin boarding. The on-plane service was good, the staff friendly and professional and the food was surprisingly very good. The plane was old, with no charging stations or personal entertainment system at individual seats (and I wouldn't call a hanging aisle TV, set at mute, playing some random old movies any kind of entertainment). However, what made the flight especially bad for me was the seat. I had an aisle seat, which I generally like, but the aisle armrest was of the type that couldn't be lifted and the entire flight its corner was constantly eating into my leg. It was 8+ hours of suffering, in a plane which was insufficiently cool. The flight cost just over $500 one way and I think that's a little too much for an old plane with uncomfortable seats and no technology whatsoever. For a no frills plane, the cost should have been no more than $400-450 one way, even during high season."
2289,"Had to fly to Honolulu for a business trip and usually have to layover in Dallas. Since I had an early morning flight, the first leg of the journey was fine. The second leg of the journey was not as bad as previous experiences with American but the service was deplorable.  The flight attendants don't seem to care about  providing a sufficient level of service for those of us paying for their benefits. During the 7 hour flight from Dallas to Honolulu, the flight attendants walk the aisles maybe 3 times. If they pass you the first time, you will just have to wait until the second round."
2290,"  Flew Tokyo/Narita to Los Angeles with American Airlines. My seat was at the very rear part of the aircraft. It was so noisy during the takeoff, but fortunately, it was not disturbing for most of the flight. Due to easy access to the restrooms, I could use them conveniently. The meal service was also not bad. I was served the first meal (dinner) just one to two hours after takeoff. Between the two main meals (dinner and breakfast), passengers could take snacks and beverages freely in the galley. The food supply was sufficient that I didn't have to starve. The in-flight entertainment system has great room for improvement. The TV was so small and the resolution was terribly low. The options of programmes and movies were far not enough in a 10-hour long-haul flight."
2291,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Las Vegas. 8 hours delay. Supposedly due to weather, however, we soon learned that the weather delay were the day before and they didn't manage to recover because the plane we were supposed to take was there at the gate but it was a former US Airways plane and they needed therefore a former US Airways crew (stationed in Phoenix), and couldn't do with an American Airlines crew stationed in Dallas. Talk about the benefit of a merger. More than a weather delay, it was a blatant organizational failure. After 5 hours of delay, we were offered the famous airport sandwich, but that's insulting for other sandwiches to call it that. In Aug 16 we took 4 flights with American, for a total of 11 hours delay. It costed us money and precious time. I had to exchange the like of 10 e-mails with the customer service in order to get a proper document regarding the delay to provide to our insurance. This airline fails almost everywhere. I live in Asia and the most obscure national carrier or low cost airlines still manage to do better."
2292,"Denver to Atlanta. I run a nonprofit outreach service. Today I was flying a girl to treatment, which we do all the time. As we usually do we tell them to call us when they get to the airport and we will pay their baggage fee over the phone. Suddenly AA is no longer taking baggage fees over the phone nor online, it's cash at the counter only. The girl had no money, and as a nonprofit I do not have the ability to send her money via western union. I called AA and asked them what they suggest I do to get the girls bags on the plane so she can go, they said it wasn't their problem and hung up. Real professional service there. Of the hundreds of flights we book Every year, I can promise they will never be on this airline again."
2293,"After a very disappointing, poor service from Air NZ last year we flew with American Airlines this year for our trip to the USA (Auckland to Los Angeles). Amazingly American turned a negative to a positive. When we arrived at Auckland we had an 18 hour wait due to a medical emergency that the pilot had when coming to Auckland thus had to wait for another pilot to come to NZ to take us to LAX. American staff at AKL were very helpful and provided food, a nice hotel room and shuttle to and from the airport for the night. Next morning we were on our way and a fantastic crew on board.  Also found the return flight home also very good. Food service very good. One item though. I was sitting at the back of the plane and the crew were in the back galley talking loudly most of the night. They have to learn on a red eye keep it down. Otherwise great flight and will use American again."
2294,"My daughter took this flight from LAX to OIA. She has traveled the world and has had no problems with her bags ever. This time, she forgot and left her work computer under her seat. Granted this was a 5 hr flight and they had to wait on the plane for over 20 minutes before they were allowed to get off, but in any case it was her fault and she forgot her computer. Frantic as I was to locate it, I called OIA and LAX. I must say each and everyone I called were friendly and sympathetic to my problem. When my daughter and I arrived home and realized she had left it on the plane, she went back to OIA and American Airlines Baggage claim advised they did not have it, but to check back the next day. Her plane had already taken back off for somewhere else. My daughter was due in Asheville, NC, so she left from OIA and drove to Asheville. She tried calling on her way up and I spent hours on the phone trying to figure out where that plane had gone. There was a gentleman at LAX by the name of KEN that was very helpful and I thanked him. The next day about 9:30a.m., my daughter texted me that they had found the computer in OIA American Airlines Baggage claim. I drove back to Orlando and gave them the description and retrieved the computer. They were very nice and helpful. I just wanted to thank American Airlines because that computer housed all my daughter work photos, etc. I don't think she will forget it, nor will I, we thought for sure it was a goner. "
2295,"Boise to Northwest Arkansas via Dallas Ft Worth. Round trip flight with four legs, first was late, second was canceled twice on two different days, third on time, fourth was late. The canceled flights was the worst. We started late, sat on the tarmac for one hour and returned to the gate. This was weather related and I am ok with that. As soon as we got inside the terminal they announced that the flight was canceled. They also would not give us our luggage, including gate checked luggage, which for us was a wheelchair. Fortunately one of the gate crew retrieved the wheelchair for us. Otherwise it would have been an even greater disaster. When we asked for our luggage they told us it would be at XNA when we got there. When we asked about lodging and meals we were informed that they have no obligation to provide that for weather related issues. When asked about future flights we were told the first available seats were for 8:00 PM the next day. In about an hour the plane left with our luggage for another itinerary. So much for weather related cancellation. They canceled us so they could use that plane for a more profitable flight. That to me that quit being a weather related issue and became a business issue. They did book us on a flight for the next morning. (so much for no seats until 8 PM) When we arrived at the airport that flight had been canceled also. I didn't hear the reason as we were scrambling to get a car to drive up. When we got there our luggage was waiting for us as evidenced by the computer showing it there and the agent being able to deliver it to us and confirm delivery on her computer. Unknown to us, they canceled our return flights the next day. Probably because we never made the second leg of our itinerary. They obviously knew we made it there because we picked up our luggage. I suppose their computers aren't capable of talking to each other. I didn't find out our reservations had been canceled until a week later when I tried to check in and they couldn't find us. I called their help desk and was told the flight from DFW to BOI was fully booked, then after further research they restored all our reservation except for our seats. When I logged in to chose our seats I found quite a few available on both flights, the only downside was that I had to pay an extra $170 because these were considered premium seats, even though two were center seats. Bottom line, avoid American Airlines if at all possible. They have the worst customer service and their integrity is lacking when they cancel you for weather issues and fly about an hour later with other passengers."
2296,"  Los Angeles to Tokyo Haneda. American Airlines had my flight schedule from Denver to LA at 8:25am and give me a layover of 8.5 hours at LA to Tokyo which I do not understand why, why give me a flight that connects to another flight that are so far apart. On top of that they delayed the flight from 6:35pm to 10pm and give us no legitimate reason on the extra delay. I could have worked the day and gone on a later flight to connect at LA then head to Tokyo, but I have to be stuck at the airport for 13.5 hours. Their customer service representatives at LA were rude. A horrible airline, and terrible customer service. I don't not recommend anyone taking this airline anywhere - just expect delays like I did with no help or other flight solutions."
2297,"Philadelphia to Sacramento via Phoenix with American Airlines. It was a one way flight. I was a little nervous going into the flight because I had heard that American Airlines was terrible. Check in was a little strange, as the member at the desk made us put up our bags on the belt ourselves. Boarding was delayed for 10 minutes because it was a full flight. Boarding was quick after that. The plane was in the new livery. There were no televisions, so I slept for most of it. As for the seats, I did not recline because there was a person behind me. Something that I was a little surprised is that after serving drinks and snacks, the flight attendants stayed in the back, and did not come out until it was time to serve another drink. Surely you should occasionally walk down the aisle and offer help and check everything? Our time in Phoenix was quick, just enough to use the restroom, and connect gates (we had to change terminals) This plane had the old livery. The ceiling had blue lights, and there were televisions hanging down from the ceiling every 3 seats. Baggage claim in Sacramento was quick. Based on my experience, I would recommend this airline, but be sure to bring your own entertainment."
2298,"New York JFK to Manchester. The check in process at JFK was appalling, it took 2 hours to reach a self serve luggage ticket machine, and then had to join another que to reach bag drop, ridiculous! We boarded an old Boeing 767 which only had a small number of Monitors running down the centre of the aircraft. Therefore if you didn't want to watch Captain Marvel, like me, then I'm afraid it was music only, except from 3 messages which I did not appreciate, the messages via the screen was. Let me clarify, I didn't choose American, I would avoid at all costs in future. The reason I was on American is I booked flights via Skyscanner and it was a BA flight with flight share by American - pity, I swear Ryanair or Jet2 have more legroom. Also as I booked late, I hadn't managed to secure a window seat which I always make use of by guess what? yeh looking out of the window, I really don't get people who have window seats and then have the blind down all of the journey - I don't get it! Please will someone explain that one to me, there were 6 people round us with window seats and blinds down, I wanted to ask each one to keep their blind up, but my wife wouldn't let me. Even in the middle seats one has a right to see out of the aircraft, don't they? Anyway, back to American, do yourselves a favour and study Emirates and Singapore for customer satisfaction, you won't go far wrong there. I hope not to fly American again."
2299,"I attempted to purchase priority boarding, so that I had space for carry on. I got online the night before the flight but could not find that option. Called customer service and they advised that the system was having problems and to have the gate agent at time of check in do it for me. Gate agent said he could not do priority boarding, it had to be done online prior to check in. Went through security, called customer service and was advised that once you check in you cannot purchase priority boarding. I subsequently called American customer service again, spoke with four different people two of whom were supposed to be supervisors. All had different answers to why or how to buy priority boarding. Not one of them said the same thing. I spoke with American Airline service center person at Phoenix airport and this lady said she had been with American many years. She advised that American had recently changed many rules and procedures and no one knew what was going on. I will never fly American again, worst service in the business."
2300,"  
Absolutely no customer service. Flight late to leave Charleston. Was assured by Charleston personnel that I didn't need to change my flight as I would get to Philadelphia in time to connect. Wrong. So my wife and I get to stay in a marginal hotel (at our expense) in Philadelphia while also having to pay for our reserved destination hotel. Hoping the return trip will be better but so far, not. Will not even consider letting me change flights to return earlier. Unfortunately not my first poor experience with American and I usually just go with the flow but felt I needed to write a review mainly because they don't really seem to care. I will do everything I can to avoid American in the future."
2301,"I guess I should start off by saying that this is the first negative review I’ve ever written. I’m normally not one to bash people on the grounds that I like to think the intention is always there, but there is no getting around my last experience with American Airlines. Okay..where do I start. My friends and I are flying from Managua, Nicaragua to Rochester, NY with connecting flights from Managua to Miami, Miami to Charlotte, Charlotte to ROC. Everything is going smoothly up until there is a 30 minute (which turns into an unannounced 50 minute) delay on the Miami to Charlotte flight…which is fine. Delays happen, I get it. However, noticing that we would probably be cutting it close to our next flight, my friend goes to ask if there were other flights we could look into it if we didn't catch it. She starts by saying that we have a connecting flight - until he cuts her off and says “-yeah, you and everyone else.” That was the end of the conversation. I also am not naive to the fact that when people are under stress they can come off as rude, but why work in customer service if you cant handle people? So wheels are down at 10:10 PM in Charlotte and our next flight departs at 10:20 PM - when we get there it’s gone. They could’ve waited 5 minutes if they knew that was the last flight out! Anyway, so we get up to the front desk after an hour wait in customer service and although the lady is very sweet, she has no idea what she's doing. It takes about 40 minutes for her to get us a hotel and book us flight the next day from Charlotte to Chicago, Chicago to ROC. We notice the next morning that there was a direct flight to Buffalo available that we said we’d be willing to fly into, but she didn't even inform us about it. So after we fly into Chicago, we get to the gate just in time to check in - only to find out that we’re not even confirmed for the flight!! The man is rude and not helpful at all; he shoos us away to the customer service phone. Thankfully, I was on standby for that flight and had a back-up flight through United (unlike my friends). So we make the trek over to the United terminal and a lady solved all our problems in about 15 minutes, all while being personable, friendly, and professional. Turns out I wasn’t even confirmed for the United flight, but she made sure I was while also confirming later flights for my friends. So moral of the story, do yourself a favor and never fly American."
2302," Ft Myers to Dallas with American Airlines. Our flight was delayed an hour and half and we would miss our next connecting flight. There were no other flights that day so they booked flights for us the next day. We were pleasantly surprised that we would be put up in a hotel free of charge for the night until we got to the hotel only to be told that no one had called from the airline to book our room and we were not given the proper documentation to do so. We called the 800 number and were rudely told they did not handle hotel issues over the phone and that we needed to return to the airport. When we got to the airport no one was behind the desk so we paged for an employee to come to the desk twice. We waited for over 30 minutes before a supervisor showed up behind the desk. As we started to talk she hardly made eye contact and rudely told us ""I am off the clock, I can't help you, were closed"" and continued walking out the door. We then called the 800 number again and we talked to a very helpful employee who was able to contact another supervisor who was still at the airport. This supervisor was very nice and fixed our problem right away. She printed off our hotel voucher and even gave us complimentary breakfast for in the morning. Prior to this experience we have always enjoyed flying with AA and were considering becoming Advantage members, but after this experience we will be using a different airline in the future."
2303," I flew from Charlotte to Boston with American Airlines on the late night flight. The boarding was slow. The interior of the aircraft was very clean. The seats were very comfortable. The lavatory was tidy. The airplane equipment was clean and comfortable but customer service was bad. The flight attendants were rude. There was a menu for the meal, I asked them for food, they rudely replied my we do not provide you food on this flight. Then I wondered, why the menu was there if they do not serve the food? But anyway, this A321 plane is super comfortable and I would recommend flying American Airlines."
2304,"  I purchased a ticket for my fiancé to join me in my hometown to go on my niece's first ever camping trip. I was already in town and was going to pick him up late last night so we could drive the 5hrs in the early morning. He waited at the PHX airport last night from 5:30pm until past 10pm (flight originally scheduled to depart at 8:15pm) when he was finally told his flight was rescheduled for the following morning (today). He then went home and back to the airport today for his supposed flight at 10am, which again was cancelled. This has ruined our trip and their online refund tool only accounts for the ticket price not taxes or surcharges, transportation (he took 3 additional Uber's), or our return flight which he will no longer be able to take. We have been looking forward to this trip for months and do not get to see my niece very often, this is devastating for us. My fiancé even took days off work that he will no longer be able to get back. He even called late last night to verify that the flight this morning was scheduled because he could not find it online, the woman who answered was extremely rude and told him it was scheduled, which was not true.  This company is constantly a disappointment, where has the customer service gone?"
2305,"Despite the many negative reviews I have read about American Airlines, I found this Philadelphia to Athens return trip to offer a significantly better product than British Airways, which I flew exclusively for many years on transatlantic flights. With AA, my partner and I were able to choose regular economy seats for free in advance, and the A330 with its 2x4x2 configuration is preferable to the dense 3x3x3 configuration BA offers out of PHL (no stranger sitting next to us). Also, the seat pitch is better then BA's new claustrophobic arrangement, and the seats themselves were much more comfortable. In addition, the A330 offered individual air vents, which BA do not on their aircraft out of PHL, allowing me to better control the temperature. The food on AA was better than BA as well, and complimentary wine was offered with meals, with refills freely provided. The AVOD system worked well and a USB power port was provided at each seat. Flight attendants on both flights were very courteous, and the ATH-PHL segment featured a warm meal, followed later by ice cream, followed by a snack, and then followed with a warm sandwich and a muffin prior to landing - very impressed. After this experience I will be choosing AA for all my future transatlantic travel out of PHL."
2306,"  I have traveled a great deal during my 46 years, and I've experienced plenty of delays, cancellations, and typical air travel mishaps. However, on a recent flight with American Airlines back from New York we landed at Chicago O'Hare Airport on a bright, sunny Sunday afternoon only to learn that our 11.20 am flight back into Cedar Rapids had been cancelled. When we went to rebooking, we quickly learned there were no available seats to CID until the next day at 10.00 am. Now this is where the frustration kicks in. Rebooking told us to find a gate agent, they would be able to help. We found a gate agent and asked for help. She educated us that rebooking should have sent us to the main ticket desk. So, we went back out through security to the main ticket counter. There we were told we would not receive any compensation for rental car, or hotel. Clearly this was not a weather related issue. I just think when the airlines causes you pain, and it's their fault, they should pay."
2307,"  Having heard a lot of unsettling stories about American Airlines, I was very anxious flying with them having booked the ticket through my agency. So leaving San Francisco we were informed about a delay due to a storm in Dallas Fort Worth that made more uncomfortable, but DFW cleared us for take off. What a pleasant flight, the captain was full of courtesy informing us of flying time and we made it. On the flight from DFW to JFK we couldn't check in online, and we were late and almost missed our flight. It reflected full but we had empty seats on take off. Worth noting though is the nice lady who allowed us to board and checked in our four bags, when the other lady was wasting our time and refusing to even check us in. Inflight the crew were excellent, however the plane looked out of shape and the toilet had a nasty smell. Thanks for changing my mind American Airlines."
2308,"  Seattle to Fort Lauderdale via Dallas with American Airlines. This criticism is less about the flight rather the complete lack of service by AA at Seattle Airport. We arrived for our flight home to Florida to find a long, long line of waiting passengers. Eventually a man from American Airlines walked along the line and told us ""All flights out are cancelled due to bad weather in Dallas, wait in line to see what options are available "" After a 3 hour wait (I am 68 years old and with a bad back) where American had 1 staff member working for economy passengers and 5 others that I counted standing around doing nothing we gave up and went to try to find a hotel. Where is the concept or understanding of ""Customer Service""? Is is completely beyond the ability of American Airlines to get their staff to actually serve their customers or is it that they just don't care about anyone anymore? I despair at how service has deteriorated so badly and I certainly won't fly American again."
2309,"  American Airlines overbooked for the leg of my trip from Philadelphia to Chicago, then decided to use a different type of airplane, which apparently required calling in a different crew. As a result I was delayed in Philadelphia for two hours, then held on the runway at Chicago for an hour, which caused me to just miss my connecting flight from Chicago to Oklahoma City. When we finally did arrive at the gate in Chicago, there was no one there to assist me in getting another flight, despite the fact that the delay was due to their decisions and also despite the fact that I was supposed to have wheelchair service at all stops. I also did not have wheelchair service at Philadelphia like I was supposed to. I am disabled and I ended up having to walk the Chicago O'Hare concourse to a different gate I was directed to, only to be told at that gate that they could not help me and I would need to use the rebooking phone to book the remainder of my flight home myself. To top it off, the rebooking phone agent was not able to assist me with hotel or food vouchers, or with information about my bags. For that, I had to stand in the domestic ticketing line for two hours, then I was issued a hotel voucher that ended up being worthless because too many vouchers were issued for that hotel, and they were full. By the time I discovered this, the AA domestic ticket counter was closed for the night, so my only option was to book a hotel last minute on my own. I have emailed AA customer service, but have so far received no reply, despite the fact that it has been four days since I emailed. There is no way to reach customer service by phone, you are always directed back to their email on the website."
2310,"Flight AA56 from Miami to London Heathrow with American Airlines. I flew in Main Cabin Extra on a Boeing 777-300ER. The groud service in Miami checked our bags even though you were supposed to do it on your own at a digital kiosk. When I boarded I didn't find a toothbrush set on my seat which is very disappointing on an overnight flight. The legroom was amazing, and that's what you expect when flying Main Cabin Extra. The seats were a bit wider than in normal Economy but didn't recline enough. They weren't as comfortable as the soft and comfy BA B747 ones and I wasn't able to sleep at all. The IFE was good with a huge range of music, many TV shows, and a adequate music on- demand radio choice. The power outlets were universal and it charged fast unlike the USB plug of the IFE. The service was good and kind, provided 3 drinks but you can ask them anytime to give you another one. The meal (I chose pasta) was pretty good, and came with a salad with dressing, a bun, crackers, cheddar, butter and a brownie. The breakfast was a fat free strawberry yougurt, a little bag of cereal for the yogurt, a cranberry snack and a flat over-processed muffin. The landing in London was the most comfortable landing i've ever had and I enjoyed the flight but it's very unfortunate I wasn't able to sleep."
2311,"The trip started in Orlando for our 7.45pm Aug 13th flight to Santa Cruz Bolivia (AA313). After 5 gate changes and an hour-ish delay we finally boarded. We then sat on the tarmac for another hour while ground crew loaded baggage. We finally take off and arrive in Miami expecting to have to have someone at American Airlines find us another flight to Santa Cruz. But, the flight to La Paz/Santa Cruz had been delayed also. We ran and made that plane only to sit on the Tarmac in Miami for another hour plus (the other passengers had been waiting much longer than that). Finally we took off for La Paz where we were to remain on the plane for our continuing flight to Santa Cruz. We waited, and waited and after around 2 hours the captain informed us that the crew had passed it's legal time and was deplaning. So we deplaned and went through customs. Finally we arrived at the AA counter where we stood another 2 hours in line only to be given an 80.00 bolivian voucher for breakfast which didn't come close to paying for anything to eat but we appreciated the effort. AA apparently was not able to complete its obligation to get us to our destination so they put us on a BOA plane and got us to Santa Cruz after another nearly 6 hour wait. The last part may not come as a surprise but for good measure the luggage was still sitting in Miami when we arrived in Santa Cruz. AA made me pay for a taxi the next day to go back to the airport to pick up my luggage and be subjected to searches and immigration all over again. I have never had this kind of experience and the lack of customer service was abysmal."
2312,"I had not flown American since their merger with US Airways. I flew first class Tuscon to Charlotte via Dallas and was not impressed. The best way to discuss the flight attendant on the flight to DFW was ""robotic"". She literally went ""through the motions"" of providing service and nothing else. The breakfast meal, yogurt, a granola bar and orange juice, was uninspiring. Transferring in DFW was easy. There were 2 attendants in first class on the flight to Charlotte. Both were much better than the one I had going to DFW. The meal, itself, left a lot to be desired. The ""hot"" towels that were passed out were room-temperature; so were the ""warm"" nuts. I had ravioli that was served with a ""salad"" which consisted of lettuce, one grape tomato that was sliced in half, and a cucumber slice. The salad dressing was straight of a packet. The ravioli were OK. Actually, the best part of the meal was the pretzel roll that was served with the meal. It was quite good. Sadly, there was no dessert. It seems that American Airlines is flying with the old US Airways mantra of ""do the least you can do to get by"". What a shame."
2313," Denver to Cozumel via Dallas with American Airlines. The outbound flight was canceled via text message at midnight, 9 hours before the scheduled departure with the excuse given that AA had no staffing for that flight and rescheduled us for the following day (36 hours later). After a heated discussion with their customer service I was told there were no other flights available. My 15 year old daughter found another flight within 2 minutes using her cell phone. I checked the flight online and discovered that there were 8 available seats. Another phone call back to AA. I presented our case and managed to get us on a new flight that left 4 hours earlier than our original. We grabbed our bags (1:15am) and rushed to the airport. The remainder of that day was uneventful. Fast forward 8 days later after an incredible stay in Cozumel, we land in Dallas for our connection to Denver. We waited 2.5 hours at the gate. AA informs us of a 15 min delay, then a 30 min delay, then a 45 min delay. Finally a gate attendant announces that the plane is on the ground and that they need to deplane, clean up a bit and then we will be on our way. 5 minutes later we see the gate monitor change from an 11pm departure time to a 6am (the following day). This was followed by an announcement the the crew had ""timed out"" and the flight had been canceled. No apologies, no attempt to rebook flights. The gate closed and we were left sitting there. My family and I spent 7 hours trying to sleep on the airport floor waiting for the next flight. We boarded the following morning and finally made it back to Denver. I will never fly AA again. No accountability, no customer service, they honestly do not care at all."
2314,"Wilmington, NC to Lubbock, TX. I'd rather drive cross country than use American Airlines again. Due to a death in the family, I was trying to fly my wife in to attend the funeral. The day of her flight, we got 5 departure time updates in 30 minutes, the last of which pushing up the departure time an hour and thirty minutes from the original posted time. Because we were traveling over that just to get to the airport, although I sped, ran red lights, etc, they would not allow her on the plane even though it was still connected to the airbridge and she missed that flight. Although they were ""willing to work with us"" (if that's what you want to call it), their make up flight for her wasn't supposed to leave until the next day, it was taking her to an airport 2.5 hours north of where she needed to be, and it wasn't even going to arrive until after the funeral. After some back and forth between myself and the ticket counter, I worked out a deal where she would fly from Wilmington, NC to Charlotte, NC, stay the night, and then depart on a United Airlines flight from Charlotte, NC to Dallas and stay on United Airlines from Dallas to her final destination. Well, at 0645 this morning, my wife calls to inform me that although American Airlines printed her a boarding pass with a seat number and everything, they failed to fund the flight change from American to United, so she will now not be allowed on that flight either. Their final fix to the problem is to now send her from Charlotte to Atlanta to Dallas to her final destination all on American Airlines. Her flight won't get in until 2 hours after the funeral, but I guess I should just be happy she's going to get to go home at this point (assuming they don't screw this up too, of which I'm not confident). I dread to see how bad they're going to screw us on the return trip. Their coordination, communication, and customer support is hands down the worst I've ever encountered. Everyone we've dealt with so far (around 7 individuals) have all given us attitude and been unwilling to put in a little leg work to fix the problem that their airline created in the first place. American Airlines is an absolute joke of an airline and an organization. If there were more steps that I knew of to take this matter further up the chain of command, I would, but because subordinate actions are a reflection of leadership, I wouldn't expect anything to come of it. If I could give advice to any new traveler, avoid American Airlines at all costs. I'm not here to advocate other airlines, but I can tell you that if you go with American and are depending on them to get you where you need to go when you need to get there, you'll be greatly disappointed and just as frustrated as I am right now with them."
2315,"Dallas to Joplin with American Airlines. Worst travel experience. I had a flight from Doha to Dallas Fort Worth and I arrived at 3pm. I had a connecting flight from there to Joplin at 8:40 pm, but the flight was cancelled due to weather conditions according to the airline, and they gave me a ticket to Joplin for the next day at 12:30 pm. I was hoping to get a voucher for a hotel to get some rest but I was shocked when they offered me a blanket instead of booking me a hotel room. This wasn't the worst part. My flight for the next day was cancelled and they offered me a flight to Springfield-Brandon airport instead of Joplin. "
2316,"  Vancouver to Dallas. As a Oneworld Emerald member you're supposed to be able to expect great service for all the money spent with these airlines. However from checking in where they gave my wife and I seats apart from each other to the delays, to the one beverage and a biscuit in a 4 hour flight, having to ask for a glass of water, grumpy hostesses who said if you don't like the service let AA know about which I am. And so I will avoid this airline whenever possible."
2317,"  Am swimming against the current of opinion here but yesterday's Miami to Los Angeles flight wasn't bad at all. Wasn't stellar but it was fine. From checking in via the app to bag drop, all ok. Counter and gate staff pleasant, and welcomed aboard by smiling chatty crew. Newish Boeing 773 inbound from London so had comprehensive IFE. Seat pitch not great but adequate. A couple of drink runs during the 5 hrs. The usual buy onboard industrial food. Crew present in cabin throughout flight. Only weird aspect was after landing, had to wait to be towed to gate 43 at terminal 4 - due to large aircraft docking at terminal designed years ago for much smaller aircraft. Based on experience, happy to fly AA again."
2318,"Our flight leaving Hartford was delayed 20 minutes, and I had a connecting flight in Philadelphia to get to my final destination of Miami. The delayed flight resulted in my mother and I running through the airport, and finally we arrived right as the doors were closing. The American Airlines supervisor refused to let us in, even though we were all (5 of us) late due to American Airlines problems. The plane was still there, but the gate attendants completely ignored us after we ran though the airport and tried to make our flight. There was no compassion, empathy, or even mere caring. I will never fly American Airlines again."
2319," Dallas to Orlando with American Airlines. This airline is despicable. In the last 2 weeks I've been on 10 flights in total - all but one has been either delayed or cancelled. When I say delayed I don't mean an hour. These flights are being delayed 3 hours, 7 hours, 24 hours. Flights are being cancelled and rebooked entirely. The customer service is giving me false reasons for the delays in order to protect them from being liable. I run a business and I am potentially losing multiple customers for my inability to be available to them, directly because of this airlines inability to put a flight together to take off at the time I paid for. If you plan to go somewhere at the time you pay to go there at, do not even consider using this airline. You will not get there. I will never book another flight with this establishment. Hideous service and I urge you to fly Southwest or Frontier, they are cheaper and will actually get you where you are paying to go."
2320,"  Baltimore to Las Vegas via Charlotte. What a disappointment! When I checked in 2 hours early I was told my flight was on time, by the time I ate a meal and went to my gate the flight had been delayed about 15 minutes. I had a scheduled layover in Charlotte for 90 mins so at this time I wasn't to worried. As the time passed the delay got longer and longer. My flight was scheduled to leave at 5:15pm. Needless to say we did not depart until 6:45pm. The flight that I was to be connecting to was going up in the air when we were descending. When we got off that flight went straight to customer service to find another flight to get me to Las Vegas that night as I already had reservations at the hotel. No flight was available until the following morning at 8am. So I lost out on 1 night of my hotel reservation plus another 1/2 day worth of travel. The airport did put me in a hotel for the night instead of having to sleep in the airport but that did not get me my time back. I then had to book another night in Las Vegas so that I could enjoy what time I was supposed to be there. On the return flights, the attendant at the desk in Las Vegas at the gate was very rude to customers. For being a 6:45 am flight I hate to see what she was like by the end of her shift. 3 of the 4 planes were old, no in flight entertainment was provided on 3 flights. The food and drinks are very expensive! Definitely will not be flying American Airlines again."
2321,"I am writing to review how rude and unprofessional the reservation specialists are when you call to make a phone reservation on American Airlines. I could see if it was one specialist who was pehaps having a bad day, but it happens consistently. I will not ever fly American because of this. I am in the customer service industry and I was honestly completely shocked at how rude, short and unprofessional 3 different phone reps were in the last few days as I made different reservations. It is unbelievable to me how badly I was talked to when making simple reservations with no questions or issues. The representatives sounded angry, annoyed and incredibly arrogant. I heard heavy sighs (when I asked one to repeat herself because she talked so fast I missed the record locator number), voices raised in anger (when I asked if I could receive a seat assignment). I am not joking when I say I was a very easy customer. I can't imagine what would happen if they were presented with an actual challenging itinerary or challenging customer. I think American Airlines needs to invest in some quality training for their phone reps. It is appalling and you are losing customers left and right because of this."
2322,  Phoenix to Ontario. I will try not to fly American Airlines in the future. My flight was delayed - that happens. However the customer service was not knowledgeable and were annoyed with my questions. I suppose I was bothering them? Most unprofessional. So now the delaying my flight is not unforgivable.
2323,"  I have never experience such a frustrating flight ever before. This is the first time I fly with American Airlines and will be the last time. My husband and I flew from Charlotte, NC to Santa Ana, CA and there was just delay after delay. I really didn't mind the delay at all because I knew that there was nothing that they could have done, what is done is done. But were there not any protocol to check the plane before letting passenger board the airplane? We sat there for a hour before they told us that everyone have to leave the airplane because they couldn't fix it and they need to give us a new airplane. So our flight was supposed to depart at 6:30 a.m. but we did not depart until 8:30 a.m. We got back on the plane and sit there for another hour because there was some ""computer glitches."" Obviously, we missed our connecting flight. Once we landed in Dallas to try to catch our connecting flight that we already missed, the staff handed us some new boarding pass to our new connecting flight which was a thumb up. But wait, that wasn't it. They gave us the wrong boarding pass, because while my husband and I waited for our plane to get boarded, we heard over the intercom, ""Last call for (our names) to Santa Ana."" My husband and I look at each other and was confuse on why do another flight have our names instead of the flight we were supposed to get on by the boarding pass the staff hand out to us. Well, we couldn't complain because it was an earlier flight or we will have to wait for another hour, but we were really concern about our baggages. When we arrived to Santa Ana, we did got our baggages, so that was maybe one thing that AA did right. On our flight back home, everything was going well. The flight were on time, no delays, we didn't have any problem. But once we arrive to Phoenix for our connecting flight, there were some problems. When I handed that staff my boarding pass, I couldn't board, because I ""did not check in."" If I did not check in, how did I arrived to Phoenix from California? And how did I have my boarding pass in my hand? My mother in law and husband is checked in and able to board, but I wasn't able to when we obviously all checked in together. Obviously AA is horrible with delay, so they obviously bump me off the flight and give my seat to someone else that flight was delay. My husband was not having it, after throwing a little scene, they offered to give me a $500 voucher and a hotel room. Of course, I was not having it, time could not be bought. But thankfully another passenger volunteer to stay so I could take their seat. But it's ridiculous how my seat was given to someone else and they overbooked the flight. AA really need to work on their flight, not always being delay and screwing people over. Do not recommend this airline to anyone. The customer service line is always long, because they're always screwing up!"
2324,"London Heathrow to Fresno via Dallas with American Airlines. The layover in Dallas was supposed to be about 5 hours, which is already quite long. However we ended up being there for 9 hours. The airline needed a pilot and 2 staff to fly in from Tulsa. The continuous delays on already overstressed passengers were ridiculous. We were not offered vouchers or anything else for food as we waited for 4 hours as the airline tried to pull themselves together to get the pilot and staff there. This is completely unacceptable. At the very least, some sort of voucher should have been given to cover our food and drink. I am really disappointed in American Airlines, where basic courtesy was not provided."
2325,Seattle to New York JFK with American Airlines. Check-in personnel were very rude and not helpful at all. I arrived more than 4 hours early after getting off a cruise to Alaska. You would think I committed crime of the century. There was no place to sit while I waited for the 4 hour mark to approach. Whatever seats were available were filthy dirty. What a disgrace. When I used the kiosk to print my boarding pass and luggage tags I got an error message and was scolded by an employee whose job appeared to be keeping you off the line if you were more than 4 hours early checking in. My trip was very expensive and I do not appreciate being treated in such a poor manner.
2326,"  I normally do not review, however beyond disappointed in the service received!!! Flying out of Cleveland, OH to Corpus Christi, TX, my connecting flight had an hour and 20 minute layover in Dallas, TX. Not only was my flight delayed 3 times, which would have left me missing my connecting flight by 30 minutes, my connection was delayed and I missed that by 10 minutes thanks to waiting for my plain to taxi. American Airlines was nice enough to put me up in a hotel for the evening (even if I had no clothes, toiletries, etc since everything was checked, I at least had a bed) my connecting flight showed a printed time of 0820, American showed the flight on their screens as 0850 on time (would have been nice to know since I could have afforded the extra sleep). On the shuttle over to the airport finding out from flight attendants that American Airlines is up for contract reviews so all of their flights have been ""coincidently"" late/delayed for malfunctions. Low and behold my flight home has been delayed twice now, first to the AC once again not being to the pilots liking, and now because he'd like to check the brakes again (I'm all about safety so by no means am I upset over the last issue). However what spurred the outrage was when I decided to speak with Customer Service.  I politely and softly asked if we would possibly be leaving in the late morning/early afternoon so I could make arrangements for both meetings and travel back home, only to be rudely yelled at the attendant at the gate quite loudly stating that the brakes were an important part of the plane. Now I can understand if there had been multiple guest that asked rude questions how her ""customer service"" skills could have been strained, however no one had spoken with her and her immediate answer was defensive, hostile and rude to a simple, polite question, American Airlines maybe while you are ""negotiating contracts"" you take your guest who faithfully fly with you into consideration and retrain your staff in customer service skills to be slightly more understanding and just polite to the innocent bystanders that just want to get home to their families. Not only will this be my last flight with American Airlines, but I will not be referring then to family and friends. To those considering American Airlines. Make sure their not going through negotiations when you book!"
2327,"Chicago to Dallas with American Airlines. When you try to check-in online you find that all the seats cost extra unless you want a middle seat by the bathroom or galley. I purchased the Main Cabin Extra upgrade based on what they claimed the benefits are, but they withheld important information that would have made the exorbitant price they charged not worth it. One of their claims is that you get priority boarding - that is after all the AAdvantage and many other categories have boarded. By the time we boarded (Group 1) the plane was already full and there was no room for a backpack under the seat in front of me. The passenger in front of me had a huge bag overhead, another under the seat in front of him, and another under his seat. The passengers that did not fall for this upgrade trap saved themselves $180 and got exactly the same privilege and inconvenience as me. So a piece of advice - never upgrade online, you will get the same seats and inconvenience for free. Their preferred seat and Main Cabin Extra are not worth a fraction of what they charge"
2328,"All for business. 4 days 4 flights from New York to Chicago via San Francisco. Checked in online. Their web and App work perfectly. All fligths on time, boarding by groups. All planes with individual IFE, lots of movies. Seat pitch ok. FA's great in general. Really noticed all the changes, new aircrafts, great improvement. No meals on board, but free soft drinks on every flight. Always arrived ahead of time. Good job American Airlines."
2329,  Montreal to Reno via Chicago O'Hare on American Airlines. Worst experience ever. On the first trip there was a six hour delay on top of a six hour layover then they had no food on the flight. They messed up the date on my return flight and wanted to charge me $200 plus an additional $900 for a new ticket. The costumer service agent was useless and the supervisor I spoke with was incredibly rude.
2330,"The flight from Orlando to Philadelphia, AA1666 was delayed for over 1 hour, the pilot announced that he would try to catch up as he knew that there were people on board who had a connection to catch and would the passengers allow these people to leave the plane first. He made up about half an hour and the passengers ignored his request, taking us over 15 miutes to exit from row 30, giving us about 10 minutes to run from 16B to 269A. As an 83 year old man with an 81 year old lady, it is a wonder that we did not have a heart attack as the temp was 95 degrees. We reached A24 in time to meet a family of 4 who were walking back and informed us that they had shut the gate and would not wait. This was for flight AA734. They said they had been told to go to ""customer service"", a very long walk back. Here we were dealt with by the worlds worst and slowest typist. She proceeded to produce boarding passes for 2 of us and the 4 other passengers. She printed out 8 boarding passes, stared at each one and then threw them in the trash. She then produced 2 more, 1 at each side of the plane, I gave them back and she eventually gave me 2 for row 30. The other party asked for 4 seats together, not near a toilet, so they were eventually given 4 seats next to the toilets for the next day. This operation took her well over an hour, she then told us to go outside where a mini bus would take us to a ""hotel"". The 11 seater mini bus arrived with 7 passengers already on board and asked us to climb in, I sat on the edge of a seat with my foot in the door well and my lady companion sat on the spare wheel. We were then taken 25 miles to the ""Hotel"" which turned out to be a motel. By this time we were all very hungry as we had not eaten for about 10 hours only to be told that there would be no food until breakfast the next day. At this point I asked if I could make a phone call as there would be a taxi waiting for me in Manchester. Surprise, surprise the young man in reception informed me that they did not have a phone, I said they must be the only ""hotel"" in the world without a phone. He said they did not have an outside line. and there was no mobile network. As the taxi arrived in Manchester and waited 2 hours and returned home empty I have had to pay £125 instead of the £55 which I should have paid on the correct day. The next morning we were told that the only trip back to the airport was at 10.30 am so the 13 passengers again crammed into the 11 seater mini bus and we were taken back to the airport to catch our flight at 8.55 pm, after a half hour trip back we then had to wait in the airport we had to wait for aprox. 10 hours. I have travelled the world since I was 18 years old, have been delayed for 24 hours on three accasions but have never felt the need to complain before, but this experience was the most chaotic of my life so far. I am £70 out of pocket, this was my first flight with American Airlines and definitely my last. "
2331,Our flight was delayed from Los Angeles to New York where we had a connecting flight to Birmingham. The staff on the plane were aware of this and were fantastic and arranged for us to go to the front of the plane once we had landed in New York so that we could get off it first and the staff had also advised all the other passengers via an announcement to let us go to the front. We made the next flight with minutes to spare and although our luggage never made it with us it was delivered to our house the next day and we therefore had a very efficient experience with American Airlines.
2332,"  Philadelphia to Norfolk. Really bad experience with this airline in multiple occasions, but today is the last time. For 4 years every time I traveled with American Airlines it will always delay and I'm not talking about a couple minutes, because that would be fine. I'm talking about hours. I'm actually waiting for my plane right now as I type this and I've been waiting for 4 hours from its original boarding time. Also no one updates us on our flight, for example boarding time was 06:50 pm and it was 06:45 and the plane was still not there. No updates on what's going on, everyone was confuse. This happened 3 times. Finally fed up, a couple of us went to customer service to ask question, in which she didn't really give us any answers and gets frustrated with us and walks away saying we are getting to rowdy and starts cussing at herself. American Airlines has given me nothing but trouble in the last 4 years I've traveled with them and I'm never using this airline again. "
2333,"Two of us flying from LAS to LAX. Paid extra for bulkhead seats and Group 1 boarding priority. When we arrived at our seats, the overhead bins were crammed full half way down the aircraft. In fact, the bin over our seats was occupied by an out of uniform LAX based flight attendant seated in the back of the aircraft! I placed my bag in the first available space, and struggled to get back up the aisle to my seat. My partner had a small, soft-sided bag, and we placed it under the last row of first class seats, in front of the bulkhead, a very secure location. The flight attendants completed their pre take off checks, and never mentioned a problem with the location of the carry on bag. Prior to landing, a crew member walked through the cabin, spotted the bag under the first class seat, and went ballistic at us. She shouted that it was against FAA policy to have a bag in that location. We said, ""fine, no problem, we're happy for you to move it."" She snatched the bag, put it in a first class bin, came back, and proceeded to scold us like naughty children, shouting, again, that it was against FAA policy to have a bag in that location, and told us that ""we had better put it in am overhead bin next time!"" She stormed off, and I was shaking with anger. Since I had to wait after landing to retrieve my bag from the back, I decided I would wait until all of the customers were off the aircraft so I could get her name. I approached her and asked for her name, which she refused to provide. When we both attempted to discuss why we were so disgusted with her behaviour, she threw up her hands in the air, stepped back, and said ""OK, now I feel like your ganging up on me!"" and she walked away. We were totally calm and rational, she was freaking out. She came back and again told us twice about FAA regulations, and walked away, This is how American deals with customer complaints, they claim that they are feeling ""threatened"" so they don't have to address the issue. Concerned that she would be calling the police, we walked off of the aircraft, and decided to pursue the issue via other means."
2334,  Flew American Airlines from Philadelphia to Charlotte. Staff extremely condescending and rude. Made several back handed comments about passengers. Also no notice given about newer model aircraft luggage storage being a few inches shorter in depth causing bags not to fit easily. I would not choose this particular airline if possible.
2335,Flew New York to Edinburgh. I had a very enjoyable flight despite flying on an old aircraft with an old entertainment system. The legroom was good and the cabin crew were very pleasant too. We even arrived 40 minutes early. I will definitely fly direct from Edinburgh on American Airlines next time.
2336,"Lexington to Milwaukee via Chicago with American. I wish I had seen these reviews before I booked my flight. I got to the airport more than 2 hours early and was told my flight would be very late and would miss my connection due to crew issues. They said that there were flights to Chicago and I would wait on stand by. When I got to Chicago, they actually had seats available, but wouldn't give me one without paying an additional $75.00. Then they said I could pay an additional $75.00 and go stand by. When I said I had already paid to get to Milwaukee I was told that it was a take it or leave it option. When I mentioned that they told me in Lexington that they would put me up in a hotel, I was informed that unless I got a hotel voucher for them in Lexington, they couldn't honor it. Ended up taking a shuttle bus from Chicago to Milwaukee."
2337,"Sacramento to Flagstaff. Once again a completely disastrous experience with this airline. Years ago flying from Orlando to Sacramento they left us stranded in Phoenix and offered no assistance whatsoever. We literally watched them put our luggage on the plane as they slammed the door in our face and said sorry it's to late and left us stranded in Phoenix with 2 young kids without our luggage. Thank god for Southwest, we were able to buy tickets to get home the same day. All they offered after we contacted their customer service was a voucher for future flights, no refund for the flight they failed to let us board. So this experience was just as horrific! Except worse! Our departure from Sacramento was scheduled for early morning so we decided to stay at a hotel to be closer and allow us extra time. When we arrived they informed us the plane had hit a bird while landing which I completely understand is out of their control. The way they handled things were where the disaster began. There was clearly no sense of urgency from the ground crew to inspect or repair anything, no repairs were needed. None the less delayed for 2 hours made our connection to Flagstaff impossible. When we asked to get on the next flight we were informed by another non-caring American Airlines employee that the rest of the flights for the day were full so they could only get us there the next morning. For a 30 minute flight we opted to rent a car and drive so we wouldn't loose any more of our already shortened weekend time with our daughter. When we asked for our luggage they rudely informed us that we would have to wait until it showed up in Flagstaff later that night - and you'll never guess but that flight was delayed too!  When we arrived at the Flagstaff airport Sunday after our shortened weekend visit with our daughter, they checked us through security, took our bags and then informed everyone they had an issue with one of the plane doors and we would be delayed. After about an hour they informed everyone that they were sending a bus to pick us up and drive us to Phoenix since they were unable to resolve the door issue. Once again missing our connection flight back home. We again opted to rent a car and head on our own way so we would be assured of getting to Phoenix as quickly as possible. What a total nightmare thanks to American Airlines once again! It might not have been so bad if they had just one person that actually acted like they cared and maybe attempted to be simpathetic. I wish someone else flew into Flagstaff."
2338,"First time flying with American Airlines, and I will never fly with them again! It was a disaster and torture. They kept delaying our flight, when you had other people flying out at the same gate, but we kept getting delayed. We had 4 children with us under the age of 5, 2 were infants. We were stuck at the airport from 6:30pm to 3am because the flight kept getting delayed so finally they say it's time to board, so we wait some more. Than they decide to switch the gate number on us, so we arrive at the gate and wait another 30 minutes. Than they tell us the flight has been cancelled for an unacceptable reason! It was late and the kids were extremely tired. They took forever to reroute us to another day. They give us a hotel voucher, so we finally get to the hotel after 3am to find out all the rooms were booked. What a nightmare of a day we had. It kept getting worse by the hour! I hate what you made us and our children go through! Never again will I travel with an unprofessional uncaring airline like yours! You made our traveling experience miserable!"
2339,"  
Flew from Chicago to Atlanta. Every time I fly American, US Air or one of their partners something happens. They are rude, inconsiderate, unprofessional, I could go on and on. I haven't met a friendly staff member yet. They change the rules and what they let on, bag size, seating, etc on the fly to suit themselves and themselves only. Let's just say with this airline, you get what you pay for. If you pay half or less than one of the better airlines - Delta - then expect to get less than half the quality of service. It's getting nearly as bad as southwest with their cattle call boarding process. They nickel and dime you to the point you would have been better off paying for the more expensive flight in the first place. TERRIBLE airline and I swear if I can avoid it from today forward I will. Oh and PS, they are RARELY on time, taking off, landing, boarding, etc."
2340,"In an attempt to reach a memorial service in Austin, TX, I booked an American Airlines trip on 7/28/16 from Dayton, OH to Austin. It would take me through ORD, where everything would go wrong. We had no issues flying into ORD, arriving at 1200 CT. The connecting flight to AUS was scheduled for 1400 CT, but was delayed for an hour and a half (AA1474). The delays continued as the ticket counter informed us repeatedly that we had an aircraft but we had no crew to fly it. After delaying multiple times and moving gates three times (anyone who's flown through ORD knows how awful that is), we were finally informed that our crew had landed and were preparing to run their security checks in the aircraft. At this point, we were lined up and ready to board at 1900 CT - over 7 hours delayed because of crew issues. Out of nowhere, the counter announced the flight was cancelled but would give us no information whatsoever. The agents were rude and dismissive, only giving us re-booking numbers. Because of their ridiculous delays (how the largest US carrier doesn't have pilots on standby in one of the world's busiest airports is beyond me), there were no flights out of ORD that would get me into Austin in time for the memorial the following day. Because there was no point to travel to Austin, I requested to return home and have my money refunded to me (a fair request considering I would miss my event and I spent an entire day in ORD because their incompetence.). The agent informed me that they could only offer a voucher because the trip was marked cancelled due to weather. This was an outright lie as they repeatedly noted that it was crew related. I work in private aviation with access to FAA databases, and everything noted about the flight involves crew issues. There were even other aircraft flying at that same time from ORD to other Texas locations (DFW was a flight I attempted to fly on but was full). AA changed the cancellation reason because they aren't financially responsible to refund airfare and/or offer hotel vouchers. I even requested a food voucher at 2100 CT, and they refused that because my original flight was cancelled for weather. I have sent them multiple requests for a refund, but they refuse. They haven't even offered a phone number to contact their customer relations dept, as they only contact customers through an un-returnable email. It's absurd for them to think that I would want their voucher; I will never fly with this airline again. I would avoid them as well because when things go poorly, they will treat you like dirt and lie about it to your face."
2341,"  A miserable experience with American Airlines from Miami to Quito. Flight was delayed 2 hours and then it started raining heavily so it was delayed 4 further hours. At the airport counter nobody seemed to care about giving out any information. When we finally got on the plane, to our business class seats, everything was dirty and smelt horrible. We had to wait an extra 45 minutes inside the plane because they had forgotten to bring some of the luggage onboard the plane. Business class cabin crew served dinner and nuts and that was that. Never even tried to make the flight a good experience after more than 8 hours of delay. So much turbulence during the flight and a horrible landing. Our experience was terrible. Business class was not worth it and we even had to wait a long time for our bags."
2342,"  New York JFK to Palma de Mallorca via Madrid. My family and I just got back from vacation in Mallorca. We booked our flights with American Airlines and the flight was operated by Iberia. The experience was terrible with both companies was terrible. On the flight over our flight was delayed and we missed our connection in Madrid, we were put on an extra flight that took us to Santiago and then to Palma, Mallorca. We arrived to Mallorca 12 hours delayed - that was out of the airlines control.  When we went to check in for our flight back home we were told that none of us (5 passengers) were on the flight list! We stood at the check in counter for an hour and a half while the costumer service agent tried to fix the problem and give us a new booking. Apparently while our flight over was altered due to the delay and missed connection someone deleted us from the flight list on our return flights, so that we appeared on the flight list but could not have boarding passes printed. The agent was able to fix all of our flights but one, she could not figure out how to reissue the ticket for my cousin from Madrid to New York so we had to leave him behind at the airport in Madrid. Iberia staff members including supervisors told us that their ability to fix this issue was limited because it was technically an American Airlines booking, however they could not get a representative from American Airlines to be of assistance (and neither could I on my 3 international phone calls for over an hour to America Airlines) Technically my cousins ticket was canceled so all that he could do was go and buy a ticket for the following day; all that was left was a business class seat which he had to pay $5,000 for! Not to mention pay for a hotel room in Madrid for the night! We are appalled and lost a lot of money because of this, his flight, his hotel, his international call bill, the toll back from the airport, the extra gas money spent picking him up separately. I have had no help from either companies costumer service, both companies would tell us we needed to speak with the other company. This was by far the worst travel experience we have had!"
2343,"  Chicago to Dusseldorf on an American Airlines Boeing 767-300. This flight is always prone to delays - so I tracked it for a week and it has been on-time, 30 min delays, 2 hours delays and diversions en-route. So I was worried about it as I had a separate ticket from DUS to Sofia later the next day. Luckily all worked out. Boarded and welcomed on-board with a smile and directed to my seat 8J. Welcome water/juice/champaign offered along with amenity kits, blanket, pillow already at the seat. Business cabin about 2/3 full - excellent flight attendant served my aisle and she was accommodating, full of smiles and happy to chat. Departed 5 minutes early and 7 hours 35 min to Dusseldorf. Excellent halibut dinner and nice breakfast served. The one thing American can never get right is inflight entertainment. The Samsung tablets are nice but always have issues with the plugs and keeping them charged. And the movie and TV selection is prehistoric - one episode of a show? Emirates has entire seasons! Come on AA - get with the 21st century! And even worse in coach with no PTV's! Landed 15 minutes ahead of schedule and off the plane and thru immigration in minutes. Overall a great flight and outside of ground issues, inflight AA does a good job."
2344,"Salt Lake City to Miami. We booked our direct flight a month before our trip and four hours before our flight we got a call saying our flight was cancel and that we were transfer to another flight on the following day with a stop in Texas and we were going to be flying all day. When my husband called to ask for help because we needed to be that day in Miami ,the girl that he talked to just said: ""I'm sorry but I can't help you"" really? My husband had to look for other tickets and do the lady's job so we could be in Miami on time. On our way back our plane got delayed (which happens a lot with all flights and I understand) but I felt like they weren't nice about it, after we finally boarded the plane we had to wait 30 min before taking off and they never said what was happening or why were we waiting. Never flying American Airlines anymore."
2345,  My son has Down syndrome and will be flying cross country home. I asked if I could prepay for his bags (he has more than expected) and was told only with a $100 surcharge. The staff also said - How can he fly if he doesn't have the ability to pay - I was furious! Most kids don't have credit cards or $100 in their pocket. Such prejudice against his disability. 
2346,"  This New York to Manchester flight was taken on 25 February. The check-in counters at JFK Terminal 8 can be confusing for the uninitiated. Checkin was done at one station, while weighing of checked in luggages and the drop off for the luggages were at some other stations. While the queues at each station was short, it nevertheless required some effort, patience and time to figure out which was the station to get to first, and then negotiate the crowds to get to the next stations. There were a fair amount of confused travelers wondering where they were supposed to get to. I would rather stand in line for the usual check-in counters which handle everything from check-in to luggage drop-offs. The cabin crew were busy getting everyone settled at the start of the flight. They were friendly and there was lots of interaction with the passengers. I had pre-selected a seat at the back of the aircraft but was asked by the crew if I was willing to take an exit row seat somewhere in the middle of the aircraft. The food serving was quite generous."
2347," Flew American Airline's seasonal route between Los Angeles and Anchorage. Ground crew during check-in at LAX lacked sense of urgency to quickly process heavy-volume of passengers on a busy Friday evening. Customer service skills were below average. American Airlines' ground crew at LAX didn't even say elementary things like, ""Hi, How are you?"" or ""Have a nice flight."" On-board the A319, the leather seats in economy class were nice. There is no seat-back TV for a long 5 hour flight. The on-board wi-fi worked well. During return flight, the cabin was very uncomfortably warm and that made it harder to sleep. No pillows are provided during overnight flight between Anchorage and Los Angeles."
2348,"  I would like to say how disappointed I was with my experience with American Airlines. I recently traveled overseas from Philadelphia to Athens with my family. Firstly, I expected anyone with children to be among the first to be boarded. I was, I believe the only one with a 9 month old baby in addition to my 3 1/2 year old toddler. To my surprise, and I'm sure the other parents, we never heard a ""anyone with young children, please feel free to board"" call. Secondly, I was extremely aggravated and angered that I couldn't get the bassinet and seat that goes with it for my baby and I. I called American Airlines weeks before and even 24 hours before my flight, not to mention my Travel Agent who requested that seat for me when they booked my tickets, and was told that ""we don't reserve the bassinet; it's first come, first served"". I can appreciate that and even understand that. What I can't understand is when I arrive at the gate to get it I am told that ""a bassinet is available however the seats have been taken by some people who requested the extra leg room"".  I guess American Airlines is fine with giving a seat to someone for extra leg room over a baby who needs a bassinet to sleep in? I had to hold my baby for a 9 hour flight and keep handing her over to my husband to hold while I took my toddler to the bathroom or so I could eat my meal that the flight attendant kindly put aside for me. The flight attendants were the best part of the flight. Thirdly, I didn't appreciate the fact that the assigned seats for my family had my 3 1/2 year seated between two complete strangers while my husband and I were directly behind her with the baby. Obviously, my husband switched so that my child would be with me but who is in charge of seating arrangements that can't understand the concept of keeping a child together with their parents? You would think they'd keep a family of 3 with a lap baby all together but I guess I'm the only one who thinks like that. Suffice it to say, in all likeliness I will not be using American Airlines to travel in the future. I have my return tickets already booked and would probably be charged to change them or else I would switch them with another airline to return home. "
2349,"American Airlines sucks. On the flight from Charlotte to Orlando they totally missed our aisle and we got no drink service. When I mentioned it to the stewardess she answered in a surly tone ""So sorry"". She was rude. I thought that was bad enough but on our return visit our luggage was not on the plane when we reached Greensboro (PTI). We understood because due to weather we had to catch another 2nd leg flight. They delivered our luggage in the middle of the night and when we opened it in the morning, everything was drenched and much of our clothes were ruined. White clothes had blue stains on them. My husband had a $400 custom made jacket that had blue stains all over it and we were told without a receipt there is no reimbursement. He bought the jacket several years ago and who saves receipts from years back? I will never fly American again!"
2350,"Ronald Reagan Washington to Manchester–Boston, NH. I had the displeasure of flying with American Airlines on Thursday. We sat on the runway for two hours before having to return to gate. I came off the plane with other travelers that were given no direction or customer service. The pilot came out and told us to stay for potential flight after the agents just walked away with a line of people still at the counter. I eventually reboarded and sat again now waiting to get gas. The gas took so long we missed our opportunity to fly out. From their they cancelled our flight. I tried to rebook and was told it would take two days, their was no openings on any flights. I was treated by rude, incompetent staff that showed no care for the fact that many of us were stranded. I received many different answers, the staff did not know what was going on so their was no information from them possible. They were rude, and heartless. I will never ever fly with this airline again. I am a very easy going traveler and understand things come up but the staff were rude and had no clue what was going on. I will never give them a penny of my money ever again."
2351," Sao Paulo to New York JFK with American. I love the American 777-300. I have never flown in real Economy (I have been in Main Cabin Extra may times). I have to say Economy looks very grim, very tight but the business class product is really very good indeed. Menu is repetitive if you fly a lot but the food on this flight was very tasty and the service good. Inflight entertainment is as good as it gets and the WiFi on board can be invaluable. Staff are good. I love the first two rows of business class row 3 and row 4. Always grab them if you can."
2352,"  My wife and I were boarding our last connecting flight home (Dallas Ft Worth to Kansas) with our carry-on luggage that we had used for all previous AA flights that day but when scanning our ticket for this particular flight, the gate agents said that my wife would have to check her bag due to the size. Granted, it would be no cost to us however the frustrating part about this is they said nothing about my bag that was the exact same size, not to mention the numerous other passengers we saw pass us to board the plane with same size bags or larger. Ours both fit perfectly fine in all the overhead bins we had used in previous AA flights. I tried to ask the agent if this was necessary considering I was not asked to check mine even when it's the same size but she insisted it was. I feel as if American Airlines targeted us (my wife) for no apparent reason. We did not want to check our bags for a reason, they met the size requirements and we wanted to be able to get off the plane and not wait for our luggage. In addition to all this, they had us board the plane and sit at the gate while they fixed 3 machanical issues before pushing off. Perhaps fix the issues before loading 100s of people onto a plane with not a lot of air circulation? Needless to say we will book with any other airlines before resorting to American Airlines for our flights."
2353,"New Orleans to JFK via Washington. American Airlines is without doubt the worst airline. Delayed for almost 4 hours with only one update. Eventually get on the plane. Told we would have to wait 30mins to take off. 2 people decided they wanted to get off and so the whole flight got cancelled. Customer services were very rude with no apologies. Said they could fly me to Le Guardia but my luggage would go to JFK. Said I would get the train and I wanted my luggage back. I waited over 2 and a half hours for my luggage and missed my train. All the staff I spoke with were rude, weren't willing to help and in one case walked off whilst myself and several other passengers were talking to him. 8.5 hours in the airport. I only had 2 days in NY before flying back to the UK. I now only have one. It has ruined what has been a great month of traveling. I will not book with them in the future and I would strongly advise people using them. American Airlines you have given yourself a terrible reputation with your overseas travelers!"
2354,"London Heathrow to Cancun via Dallas Forth Worth. Worst airline I have ever travelled with. Rang me two months before my outbound flight to tell me it was overbooked so would I be prepared to change to another flight, and in compensation they would provide an upgrade to premium economy and a travel voucher. I agreed. The customer service agent told me I would need to pick the voucher up at check in. Got to the airport, checked in and asked for the voucher, to which I got the reply of 'no, that has to be sent to you, you'll have to chase it up'. Flight was delayed by over an hour due to 'paperwork issues'. This meant I missed my connection in Dallas to Cancun. No information at all was forthcoming at Dallas airport about what happened next and as it was a Sunday evening there were no other flights they could rebook me on to. They provided a voucher for a hotel, and basic food voucher but could not give me my luggage back until I arrived in Cancun, so I was left stranded on my own in Dallas without luggage, and arrived in Cancun a day late having missed the first day of my pre-organised tour. Flight attendants were useless, and didn't seem to even recognise that there were passengers on the plane - they were constantly knocking into people sat in the aisle seats. Barely any communication from the pilots. On the way back, I flew Cancun to Miami to Raleigh-Durham to Heathrow. The pilots on the Raleigh-Durham flight were much better and communicated everything. As a nervous flyer this helps a lot. Took 12 months to be able to receive compensation for the outbound flight delay and missing tour and 12 months to receive the original voucher promised to me when I was asked to change flights! Overall, poor customer service, poor organisation, and poor in-flight service. how they're still operating is beyond me."
2355,"Denver to Chicago. I saw another review with the same complaint I have to a tee. They lie. They use weather as an excuse for delays and cancellations so they don't have to compensate you. I watched several planes depart for my destination as my plane Sat grounded for weather. And as people scrambled for connection options. They didn't send any extra reps. Over 100 people with one rep - and don't bother calling their 1-800 reps, the wait there was 2 hours."
2356,"Manchester to Chicago. First my flight from Manchester to Chicago was delayed by 2 hours, the staff onboard were unprofessional and amateur. I'm currently sat in Chicago airport waiting for my return flight which has also been delayed by 1 hour after the gate number changing for some reason or another. 50% of the flights are delayed as I'm sat here, it's seems like an absolute shambles and rat race! I can only hope that the plane leaves at the new scheduled time. One thing is certain, I won't be flying with American Airlines in the future, I'll pay the higher cost of Virgin Atlantic and receive the level of service you expect when paying £1,400 for a 7.5 hour flight!"
2357,"Horrible experience with American Airline. Our flight was from Cedar Rapids was delayed due to the weather, and I want to highlight the fact that AA is not giving you food & accommodation vouchers if flight was delayed due to weather. It is still a mystery how to determine a weather conditions. The sky was bright, the sun was shining, everyone else was departing and arriving on time. The weather was selective to AA exclusively. AA arranged the alternative flight for us two hours late and it was canceled due to weather again, I hate to repeat myself, but: The sky was bright, the sun was shining, everyone else was departing and arriving on time. The weather was selective to AA exclusively. After spending several extra (thanks to AA and weather) hours in Dallas airport we decided to drive to Houston. The weather was beautiful! Next day I called AA twice trying get to the bottom of the delayed, cancellation and refunds situation. It is not easy and AA was not clear on the process, or found many excuses and no apologies at all. "
2358,"  NYC to Curacao via Miami. I was set to leave on 7/26. I get a notice that my flight is canceled just a few hours before. They tell me it is weather related. I am in NYC. I notice that the 6:59 AM flight (exact same time as mine) is leaving from LGA and no weather related issues. This is the same with the 5:50 am, 6:00 am and 6:30 am flight to Miami. How is it that the 6:59am from JFK is canceled due to weather? No compensation offered. I ask to speak to supervisor and she tells me it isn't weather related, but cannot offer me any help. I have to get on the flight at 6:59 on 7/27, losing a vacation day of my own and a hotel day that I paid for. I call again and demand a voucher for this. Then, I get on the flight on 7/27, the line was an absolute nightmare. I get to the kiosk and it tells me I need assistance when I fill in the information. Because I am not flying back with American (the smartest choice anyone can make), I need to see an agent. I get on yet another line to do so and now I have to pay $25 for my bag to Curacao. I'm upset but I eat it up. Then, the flight is delayed and guess what? I make the flight, but my luggage does not! About 20 other people are in this situation too. Now, I am in Curacao waiting for my luggage, another vacation day lost, without basic toiletries and they tell me it will arrive at my hotel in the evening. Well it is the next morning and I have no suitcase, nothing. I am still waiting on it. Why did I pay $25? I have wasted 2 vacation days for nothing.  Do not book with this airline. They will ruin your time and your vacation and you will spend money to not get there and not have your belongings. And the outlets don't work on the plane!"
2359,"Austin to Kansas City via Dallas. I wanted to change a flight out to later today or tomorrow. When I called, I was notified that would cost me 200 dollars just to want to change the flight and additional 150 dollars to buy the other flight. $350 to change a flight on my end. American Airlines cancels the first flight out for the day. I am now, not booked on the next flight but the third flight out. This is a 4 hour layover. They gave me a 12 dollar voucher. $12 to change a flight on American Airlines end. Why is this ok? I am an easy and care free traveler, but American Airlines takes advantage of their customers' time and money! "
2360,"West Coast to Hawaii in Economy on Americans new A321. A very pleasant flight, nice looking and clean aircraft, comfortable seats, great IFE and friendly ""Aloha spirit"" crew wearing leis (Hawaiin flower necklaces). They seemed to enjoy working this route. American should consider offering snack packs on flights to Hawaii as these flights come in around 5.5 to 6 hrs. Overall a very pleasant experience."
2361,"Honolulu to Dallas Ft Worth. This is by far one of the worst AA flights I have ever been on. As a frequent flyer I knew not to expect too much of their Boeing 767-300 product. The domestic 767's are ancient, nothing has been done to the Y cabin since early 1990's. The seats are worn, uncomfortable and lacks IFE. Cabin panels are so old that they're turning yellow and everything on this plane was dirty. The safety video wouldn't play because the old aisle CRT-screens in Y wouldn't even turn on. Tray table was dirty and covered in food residue. Reading light did not work, so I was left with nothing to do for 8+ hours as again, there is no in seat IFE. American also has the nerve to charge you for headphones. Good thing I brought my own, but no, since the headphone jack wasn't working either. The only good thing about this flight was the very friendly and personal captain, who came out into the boarding area of the airport to great us with a warm welcome and some information regarding the tropical storm Darby as it would delay our flight. This captain also kept us well informed throughout the flight. Rest of flight crew was disinterested at best, which is understandable given the poor hard product they have to make do with. On this flight AA did however serve both a snack pack, free drinks and a self service bar stacked with wraps and other snacks, which was appreciated. Will fly AA again but will avoid their 767's."
2362,"  Tokyo Narita to Los Angeles with America Airlines. Customer service is horrible. My flight was 11 hours long and I came to discover that my TV / IFE wasn't working. And all the staff did was say I'm sorry there is nothing we can do, and walked away. So I had to sit there and stare at the wall my whole flight! That was my first and last time I'm ever using American Airlines."
2363,"  Los Angeles to Tokyo Haneda return. I had the chance to fly American's international product on the new Boeing 787. I especially liked the shade less windows that lighten or darken as desired. Seat pitch for Main Cabin Extra was 34"" with comfortable seats. Food was decent with good beverage service, and snacks available through the flight at the self service galley area. Two totally different crew teams though, on the trip to HND the crew was outstanding, it looked like they were making an effort to break the stereotype that prevails about American carrier labor, not the same on the return when I experienced the stiffness attitude and ""can't do that"" persona. I was left with a very positive opinion about the Boeing 787 and the Main Cabin Extra leg space. One last observation, there was some confusion upon boarding at HND for the return trip to LAX."
2364,Omaha to Key West via Chicago and Miami. American Airlines didn't fulfill their contract to get me to Key West and then offered me one third of the price from Miami to Key West as a refund instead of the two hundred plus that they charge. Love their math. They wouldn't even pay for the rental car from Miami to Key West. I actually saved them money by driving instead of waiting for a flight the next day. What a way to start a family vacation. I had to drive from midnight until around three thirty. They didn't even have to pay for a motel in Miami since I didn't stay. Not a well run company. Delays and multiple gate changes were involved in this one trip. I will only use AA as a last resort.
2365,"Chicago to Lima via Miami. I can safely say I will never fly with American Airlines again! Our original scheduled flights were from Chicago to Miami and from Miami to Lima. The second leg of our flight was supposed to be with LATAM airlines but of course this wasn't to be as American Airlines messed up from the start. Our first flight (from Chicago to Miami) was cancelled. We were not told why and told to call a call centre to arrange re-booking. We presumed when an airline cancel a flight the least you receive is an apology and helpful assistance with re-booking. We received no apology or assistance. We managed to book a new flight for ourselves (Chicago to Dallas and Dallas to Lima) We got on the new flight (Chicago to Dallas) and it was delayed by about 2 hours (again no apology, no explanation). We arrived in Dallas too late to catch our flight to Lima. We went to customer service in Dallas. We were given a new set of flights (Dallas to Miami and then Miami to Lima) for the following morning. Our original departure time from Chicago was 6.45pm on 21/07/16, we were now further away from our destination and leaving approx. 13 hours later, at 9.05am on 22/07/16. Next thing, we were given a hotel voucher to get a few hours sleep (it was almost midnight at this stage). Customer service told us to go and wait on hotel shuttle and ring the number on the voucher to call them if no sign after 30 minutes or so. Of course, no shuttle came! So we rang the number printed on the hotel voucher! 3 phone calls and 2 hours later, we realised that the number was wrong. We had been calling a different shuttle (it was 2am at this stage). We googled the correct number and finally got in touch with the correct hotel. Next morning, we wen to check-in staff and staff at the gate and asked them to make sure our bags were on the flight. They assured us they were! We got our flight from Dallas to Miami and Miami to Lima. Might I add, both of these flights were delayed. We arrived in Lima 1 hour and 15 minutes late and of course my bag was lost. Turns out, the bag never left Miami! We asked for the bag to be put on the next flight. We finally got out of the airport after midnight. We had a taxi waiting to collect us for 2 hours.  I rang this morning to ask about my bag. It was still in Miami! I rang 10 hours later today to ask where my bag is, still in Miami! We had 2 days to spend in Lima. We missed one day because of a cancelled flight, a delayed flight, a missed connection etc. We missed the second day as I have no clothes to wear and also trying to track my bag and make a complaint about American Airlines. "
2366,"Buffalo to Boston. I am disappointed in American because I don't feel like they put customers first. In just the last 3 days, I had an issue with a rebooking, a flight that was cancelled and moved to the next day, and then a delay on my way back to Boston. I'm surprised there were so many issues. I also heard several complaints from other American customers who had to pay for a hotel because their flight was cancelled, and word of mouth travels fast. I hope American starts to realize the importance of customer service. "
2367,  American Airlines texted me the night before I was supposed to leave that they had cancelled my Lexington to Chicago flight. They gave no explanation for the cancellation. They rebooked me on a flight that would get me in 10 hours late. They would not make any effort or go to any expense to find a flight that would get me to my destination even close to the time I needed. They offered no apology or compensation even though the flight that I purchased originally was significantly more expensive than the one they put me on. I will avoid American Airlines in the future whenever possible.
2368,"I left last Monday from Oakland Airport with a stopover in Phoenix and then onto Omaha. Well, due to poor weather we circled Phoenix airport until we ran low on fuel. We were then informed we would be going to Tuscon to get more fuel, we landed in Tuscon and were assured repeatedly it wouldn't take much time and we'd back in Phoenix very soon. Long and short of it, there was a line of planes ahead of us. They would not allow anyone off and we sat there for about 2 hours before getting refueled while being told we were headed back to Phoenix shortly. No food, people missed connecting flights, I was forced to say overnight in Phoenix and missed a very important day of work in Omaha. American insisted they would not offer any compensation in terms of food, hotel, etc., since it was weather related. On top of I found out from another flyer the hotel rooms offered at a ""discount"" at the Red Lion Inn were actually more expensive than their regular prices. Waiting in American Airlines customer service line was horrible, took a long time (over an hour) with lots of angry people. By the time I got another flight the next day and a room I got 2 hours of sleep. I understand things happen with weather, but the way American Airlines handled this during and after was the worst flying experience I've had to date and I'm 57 years of age. I will avoid flying American Airlines from this point forward and avoid them aggressively."
2369,"  Boston to New York JFK in August 2015. After a rather fast check-in and boarding process the plane took off in time. It was a short haul flight and the expectations for the meals were low - just a small packet of chips or cookies instead of e.g. a breakfast are definitlely a taboo for a first class service. Furthermore, the variety of beverages was very limitated and coffee was out of stock soon. The cabin facilities have seen better days as well due to the fact that they were certainly in use for decades. The cabin staff was not unfriendly but just executed their duties. Summing up, this flight experience was somewhat below the average."
2370,"  
Miami to Milan and return with American Airlines. I traveled with AA for the first time and all the stories I had heard about it were verified. To start with the planes were old. The crew though friendly were not interested in the customer. The minute they served the meal they asked the passengers to close the shutters and they disappeared not to be seen until the next meal. The crew on the way from Miami to Milan were the untidiest crew I have ever seen. This crew did not even bother to greet the passengers as we got on and off the plane. It was such a relief to get on Vueling where the crew were the exact opposite. I would never recommend AA and I will defininetly avoid it in future.

"
2371,"Chicago to Venice. American Airlines has put my friends and I through complete hell. I was supposed to arrive in Venice over 24 hours ago. After delays they switched our flight, on our connecting flight through London the plane had to land in JFK because of computer glitches and they did not feel safe flying over the ocean. After 2 hours of waiting to receive new boarding passes everyone finally boarded a new air craft that would take us instead. Once everyone was seated they immediately told us that there were glitches and we had to exit the plane and that there would be no new flights until the morning. At this point we had now missed an entire day in Venice, lost all of our money spent on hotels and tours in Venice. We have a friend that is there alone waiting for us now for days. After they made us exit the plane at 2am we spent over 3 hours talking with managers and attendants to find a new plane to Venice because at this point if we boarded the morning connecting plane through London we would miss the plane to Venice and the following plane to Venice would make us miss another day, which at that point we were supposed to be going to Florence. During the duration of time we spent after being exited from the plane, they put us on a completely different flight out of LaGuardia and promised that our bags would be moved from JFK to LaGuardia. As we just showed up to pick up our bags we have been told that in fact the bags were never taken off of the plane and are now in London. We spent hours trying to call American Airlines and spent hours talking with different people who have all basically lied to us. The amount of money and time I have wasted is inexcusable.  I couldn't imagine a worst start to what is supposed to be the most amazing trip. Thanks, American Airlines."
2372," London Heatrow to Chicago with American Airlines. I take lots of flights every year. By far, and I mean by far, the worst of these has been with American Airlines over recent years. Not just one flight, several flights. Flew from Heathrow to Chicago. Problems include: Late flights (4 hour plus delays), uncomfortable seats, no in seat entertainment system (yet to find one on an AA flight). Broken headphone socket (realise this could happen on other airlines). Terrible food, despite being on transatlantic flights. No customer service follow up (almost 3 weeks and still awaiting anything more than an acknowledgement). Will not be flying AA again."
2373,"I flew on July 2 from White Plains to Tucson--multiple problems, i.e. no gate available when we landed in Chicago, missed connecting flight and maintenance issues. They did put me up in a hotel for the night in Tempe, but because of all the delays and the time I needed to be back at the airport, I only spent 6 hours at the hotel. Trip home from Tucson to White Plains on July 9 was similar. Delayed flight from Tucson to Chicago due to weather problems and maintenance issues. Cancelled flight from Chicago to White Plains. Spent the night in Chicago (only 4 hours at the hotel), flew to Charlotte and then to White Plains. Due to delayed flights, services were not available, i.e. restaurants were closed, limited personnel to assist, etc. I have not flown American in sometime and their service has diminished immensely. Many of the employees are rude and seem disinterested in their jobs. Back to Delta."
2374,"  
Tyler to Savannah via Dallas with American Airlines. Originating flight delayed half hour due to plane leaving DFW late. Not allowed to take any carry on bags into cabin resulting in 15 minute delay collecting bags. Waited on tarmac 10 minutes because a plane was still in our gate. Raced from gate 34 to 9 hailing cart to actually arrive before door closed. Hour and a half layover completely evaporated. Many fellow passengers missed connections. There was no attempt to provide assistance other than providing passengers with connecting gate numbers. Unable to download boarding passes on phone. They appear to be totally disorganized. I will avoid American in the future Delta is much more efficient."
2375,"Phoenix to Cancun and completely disappointed in American Airlines. My husband and I booked a flight to Cancun. Three weeks before our departure we logged in to check seat status, only to find out we have to pay an additional $75 per passenger in order to sit together - as if the tickets weren't expensive enough. We called customer service and we pretty much got a ""take it or leave it attitude"" from the supervisor. This is the last time I use this airline."
2376,"  The flight from Dallas/Fort Worth to London (Heathrow) was delayed more than 3 hours, during this time no explanation or apology was given. When we eventually boarded the staff were extremely rude and condescending. The inflight entertainment was poor, the quality of the screens was something you would expect in the 1980's, and the selection of movies was awful. The in-flight food was inedible. The seats were uncomfortable and dirty. Overall this was the worst airline I have travelled with and will not fly with them again."
2377,"American has lost a customer. Flight was cancelled which I can deal with as stuff happens but when a flight is cancelled you should have a process in place. Rude agents, long lines, pieces of paper with an 800# on it with an automated system going ""Hi, would you like to purchase a ticket?"". Rerouted us with a nice 6 hour delay then put us on United which we got to the gate and said nope, no ticket, no plane and sent us back to American who sent us back to ticketing past security in Atlanta. Got back to the United Flight and guess what, delayed an hour so now will miss connecting flight in Newark. Zero ability to handle a simple cancelled flight. "
2378,"  Flew American Airlines from Miami to Chicago ORD. Flown this route many times on the Monday morning timeslot. Generally excellent service, better than other American Airlines flights (for different city pairs) on average. Plenty of leg room in first (better than Delta but not as spiffy looking), pre-ordered omelette was good enough, and service was frequent without being over done. And of course, one person had to leave their window shade open during what is typically a sleeping flight for us all. There's not really anything I'd suggest to improve this particular flight experience,

"
2379," Flew American Airlines from Shannon, Ireland to Bristol TN. Our first (and probably last) trip overseas. We are seniors and novices. Wish someone had told us to avoid American at all costs. Ground staff and flight attendants acted tired and bored. We needed to use one of those carts that carry you from one gate to another (walk would be about 3/4 mile). Finally got one. The driver suddenly stopped and started talking to a friend. When we asked, she said ""you have to get off, go down the escalator and get another one."" Then she returned to her conversation. Needless to say the $5 tip went back into my husband's pocket. Not complaining about flight delays as weather was horrendous, but we were appalled at the unprofessional attitude of support staff."
2380,"  Toronto to Phoenix via Chicago (outbound) and Charlotte (inbound). A bit of a mixed bag to be honest. For $430 CAD extra, I was able to upgrade from Economy to Business for the shorter legs and First Class to/from Phoenix. Unfortunately, a month before departure the Toronto to Chicago leg was changed to a smaller aircraft with no business class. No apology or compensation and not even a free alcoholic drink on the plane. Easy check-in, slow security (as always - Pearson being possibly the worst airport for security lines in N America) and an ok lounge with one free drink. Late boarding and departing on a small canadian regional jet with possibly the most disinterested crew member ever. He was just not interested, barely raised a smile, clearly bored and did the minimum required. On time arrival into O'Hare and on time boarding and departure on an A321 to Phoenix. Seat was ok, IFE on my ipad was average but no free wifi (hardly first class service). Slow service on boarding with a long wait for a drink. After departure, hot towel, menu, drink and meal service with wine. Poor quality dinner of steak (overcooked) and gloopy polenta) There was no bread available due to it not being loaded (on a sunday). Surely operating an airline is a 7 day a week business. The saving grace was the Purser who served the cabin well but by herself (and therefore slow). A second drink was offered and service was generally good. The A321 return trip to Charlotte was similar, an ok lounge at Phoenix with some good snacks and a free drink, on time departure, but again slow service on boarding. The meal bizarrely was a salad to start following by a prawn salad with plenty of booze. Again, the purser provided singular but excellent service to the cabin and was omni present and friendly. Charlotte to Toronto was with Eagle on an E175 which on time. Surly crew who offered snacks and one drink. (A second was given on request). Interestingly for me, other experiences with another major US carrier had excellent crew on the farmed out flights to sub contractors, and awful mainline service. With American it was the reverse - much better service with the mainline crew on the A321 and poor and miserable service on the feeder carriers. Was it worth the $430 return for the upgrade (at the time of booking) - just about. American were underwhelming - nothing particualy bad, but definately not first class service."
2381,"  Flight from Dallas to Seoul Incheon was atrocious. After arriving from Amarillo I found out that my flight to Seoul would be delayed 2 hours, meaning that I would miss my last connection flight to Jakarta. When asking the ground service about why the delay, they just rudely told me, ""Maintenance. That's all I know."" They also gave off a tone that seemed as if they hated their job. On top of this, during the actual flight that the delay was only for getting another plane ready. The old cabin sure added to the experience. The IFE was messed up, so Economy class was stuck watching Disney channel shows on repeat for the 13 hour flight. I also recall a cockroach crawling into my seat, but I wasn't surprised, so I didn't do anything about it. Wouldn't say I would never fly AA again, but they really need to start working harder and actually care for their customers."
2382," American Airlines is using a great hard product, on par or above standard. I get upgraded most of the time, so I feel slightly guilty writing this review. However flying London Heathrow - Los Angeles every month, the service seems to be of a higher standard. Los Angeles - Sydney was the same aircraft, but no bar food. Flight attendants were tired on both legs of the trip. They were unpleasant and when asking for something, it was evidently a hassle. Bar - which 777-300ER on AA is now known for has no food option except a few apples and wine. Really? This is their selling point. I often appreciate not having to bother the crew and getting snacks myself. No mid-flight snacks are offered, no water run or anything. Crew just sit in the rest area playing on their ipads or reading books. When asked if I could get a wine or something I was met with ""You seem to be up the whole time."" As if to say - don't bother us and go to bed. Overall really disappointed with the service. I should fly QF again I guess after this. Their seat is nowhere as comfortable, but food is amazing and soft product/service is excellent. AA needs to keep an eye on these ""prestigeous"" routes."
2383,"  Flew American Airlines from Brussels to Philadelphia. The international business class product on this flight was poor and reminiscent of what you would expect in 2001. Old seats with only a partial recline (nowhere near flat!). Similar to what you see in an economy plus cabin. No in-seat entertainment system. Instead each business class passenger provided with Samsung tablet and headphones. Image quality OK. Selection of movies poor. Also entertainment system requires the only outlet in the seat. Seat tray table is too small for meal and tablet and requiring you to stow tablet during meal service on balance it on your knee. No wi-Fi in cabin. Food quality was poor. The filet steak I was served was over cooked to the point that I could not eat it. Appetizer was a tomato salad followed by a Caesar salad and a steak or fish entree and small slice of cake. Two salads. Obviously not much thought given to the menu. Cabin staff were friendly but not overly helpful. Glasses not refilled. Water bottles left on armrests without being cleared. Amenity kit was also very poor. Toothbrush, eye mask, ear plugs and some free samples from Bigelowe. Again it reminded me of an economy class product. The flight departed and arrived on time."
2384,"  I would never fly American Airlines again. I planned a short weekend trip to visit my husband working in South Carolina. My flight was scheduled to leave Hartford at 1.00 pm on July 1st. We boarded on time and immediately started backing away from the gate. We then stopped and sat in place for 15 minutes and eventually returned to gate before sitting another 20 minutes. we were then told there were computer related issues and maintenance needed to be called. Apparently maintenance isn't stationed at the airport and was 30 minutes out. We were asked to deboard and wait and see. I had a 4.20 connector flight in Charlotte that was missed. The AA employees would not reschedule connections until they knew the status of the current flight. At 2.30 I received a call from AA with a new 6.20 connection time. Still no word on the current flight. At 3.00 we were told plane was fixed and reboarded. 30 minutes later we were still sitting at the gate. We were then told Charlotte airspace was closed and we needed to wait for reroute. We finally backed from gate at 3.40 and given permission to fly. At 3.50 we were then ""grounded"" for supposed weather. We sat on runway for another 30 minutes, and finally took off at 4.20. While on plane I asked the stewardess about making the 6.20 connection flight and was told she had no idea and couldn't find anything out. We landed in Charlotte at exactly 6.04. We landed at B gate. My connection was in E concourse. I sprinted the 1/2 mile to the gate and arrived at 6.15 for 6:20 flight. Plane was still there, doors still open. I was told I couldn't get on plane. I explained my flight was delayed 3 hours. I was rudely told I couldn't get on the plane and told to ""go around corner to reschedule"". I arrived at desk at 6.24 to rebook my connection. The attendant looked at his watch and asked why I didn't get on this plane. The next flight out was 5 hours later. I ended up requesting to fly to another airport having my husband drive 2 hours to pick me up. Flight home July 4: No problem from Myrtle Beach to Charlotte. Flight out of Charlotte scheduled for 8.20 pm to Hartford. Walked to gate to confirm location. Went to eat and came back to get to find gate was moved back to D concourse. Time also delayed 30 minutes. Time kept getting pushed back. A plane arrived and deboarded and were told we had to wait for service. At 9.00 we were told the plane was not cleared to fly. After 15 minutes we were sent back to B concourse. Boareded a plane there and again sat on plane for 30 minutes at gate awaiting who knows what. Ultimately took off 1.5 hours late. Overall poor customer service, significant delays, and no consideration for passengers who spent a lot of money to fly there airline. I will go back to JetBlue or Southwest for half the price and never experienced a problem with them. You lost this customer for good AA.
"
2385,"  Flew LaGuardia to Charlotte. Simply, American Airlines are the worst of at least 40 carriers I have flown. Every flight is late but they cook the books so it looks like they leave on time as they have an hour window at least. The staff are cranky and rude and most look well worn. The planes are falling apart and don't expect anything if you complain. AA like to make you angry by reading a script about how sorry they are. Any day that is spent on an AA plane or within a 2 metre radius of an AA staff member is bound to be a bad day for the customer. Don't fly with AA unless you have to for business like I do."
2386,"  Flew from Dallas Fort Worth to Chicago. I guess there's something called ""shabby chic"" in air travel, since the aircraft was in ramshackle condition. The partitions had foam insulation surrounding the edges. The window frames were literally falling off. The bottoms of the luggage containers had smears, showing they hadn't been cleaned in ages. Talk about deferred maintenance, and this was the first class cabin. The flight crew matched the apathy of the maintenance guys, as people boarded they holed up in the galley to chat, and never went through the cabin. American Airlines you can do better."
2387,"  I had an awful experience with American Airlines today flying from Orlando to Dallas Fort Worth. After they made all the passengers board earlier than scheduled because bad weather was approaching, we sat at the gate for 45 minutes because they had some catering issues. Apparently there weren't enough refreshments for all of us. The A/C of the cabin was broken (I assumed) since it was only blowing hot air. The only time that airplane was cool was when we took altitude. The flight crew couldn't care less about the passengers. They took as long as they could to replenish the freezers with the refreshments and to serve the drinks during the flight. They didn't even pick up the trash. After landing, we encountered yet another surprise: we didn't have a gate. I recommend choosing a cheaper airline. "
2388," New York City to Miami with American Airlines and I will never fly with them again. First they cancelled my 2nd July flight ""due to weather"" - it was sunny. Then they reschedule me to fly the following day when I needed to be in Miami on the 2nd. I look up prices for later in the day July 2nd and they are all $1000-$2000 a piece. Great strategy to make money. I flew on the 3rd. Complete chaos and disorganization. They wouldn't give me a seat assignment until the very end and had to board the plane once all the overhead compartments were full. The American Airlines employees were extremely rude. I have flown with them before and it was never a good experience."
2389,Los Angeles to Miami with American Airlines. Has to be the worst airline that I've travelled with - every flight was delayed. Every little thing was expensive even the headphones. Just all around uncomfortable. Service is slow and never worth choosing them over another airline. They do not give you food anymore or have TVs on the plane. Almost $10 for a mini bar bottle - it lacks professionalism.
2390,"  Philadelphia to Orlando. Worst airline I have ever flown with. Very unaccommodating and rude.  Was not able to check my bag online, had to sit in the line for 30 mins for that. Apparently I can't order more than 2 drinks because the staff has the right to decide if 1 or 2 drinks is or isn't too much for me. "
2391,"  American Airlines should be nothing short of embarrassed with their 767 service out of O'Hare International. I have flown Flight 1377 Chicago - Miami three times in the last two months and have had delays of 5 and 4 hours on these flights. Each time, there was no plane waiting at the gate and we were told they 'were doing maintenance at the hangar' and it would be ferried over shortly. Hours later, when they actually presented a 767 at the gate, we had further delays for 'new' onboard maintenance issues. In my last flight in late June, they boarded everyone, then said they had another 'minor' maintenance issue, then 45 minutes later, they deboarded everyone and sent us to a new gate. We had to wait there for yet another 767 to arrive and then once it did and we boarded - guess what - it too had maintenance issues and were further delayed. Final tally - 2 planes and five hours late to Miami, a full day of travel to cover what is a scheduled 2 1/2 hour flight, 8.20am departure arrived 6.00pm. Anyone who was unlucky enough to have connections out of MIA, which many people do, lost a full day of their vacation or business plans. I generally like flying jumbo jets, but if AA cannot properly maintain their 767s, then they clearly should not schedule them. I will no longer book any AA 767 service as I have completely lost confidence in what I had previously regarded as a top airline, to be able to provide anything close to reliable, ""on time"" service."
2392,"This was the most annoying and frustrating travel experience I have had. First, my flight from Sydney was delayed 2 hours after passengers were on board because of a faulty valve. This made a 14 hour flight turn into/feel like a 16 hour flight. This then made me miss my connecting flight out of LA. Instead of going straight to Columbus, I was sent to Philly. The flight attendants were rude and complained to the passengers. My final flight to Columbus was then delayed 3 hours. Instead of getting home at 5.20 pm like originally planned, I didn't get home until 1.01 am. To top it off, I had paid for a window seat on two of the planes, and was denied both this seat option and a reimbursement for it. When talking to customer service about it, the lady was texting while talking to me and refused to help me. I will never fly American again. This further proves that Delta Airlines is the only reliable company to fly with."
2393," Grenada to Charlotte via Miami with American Airlines. We sat for 3.5 hours on the plane in Miami awaiting take-off. The oil was low, so we waited 2.5 hours for maintenance to come, then we needed more fuel and then we had to wait on the ground crew. Finally they required all passengers to get off and find other flights. This entire ordeal caused many people to miss connecting flights, all of which could've been avoided from the start. AA did not offer any extra perks for this inconvenience - not even a drink service while sitting on the plane for 3.5 hours. Highly disappointed. They also could've had us get off earlier so we could possibly find earlier flights. One member of staff was set to reschedule 100+ flights for everyone on the plane. Surely, a courteous announcement to call a reschedule number would've worked for those not wanting to wait in line? Ridiculous - many things could have been handled differently."
2394,I fly this route almost every month and this direct flight from Pittsburgh to Raleigh is either delayed several times or cancelled altogether. This is such an unreliable flight and no one at the airport can ever tell you why it is delayed or cancelled. Ever since American Airlines took over USAir this flight is unreliable. I am spending 12 hours in the airport today rerouting once again due to this airline.
2395,"  Had to completely reroute my trip from Chicago, JFK, Milan to Dallas, Miami, Milan because of maintenance issues. Made me late to Milan for starters. Boarded what seemed the oldest plane I've flown on in the last several years. International flight with old wall mounted TV screens, didn't realize they were still around. The seats still had places where the old ash trays used to be. American Airlines - update your fleet.

"
2396,"  Short haul flight from Boston to Washington D.C.-Reagan on an A319. This was my first time flying any American airline and I had no expectations whatsoever. However, this flight was one of the best short-haul flights I've ever been on. Push back in Boston was on-time. Service was on par with a lot of other airlines, or even better. Seat width was more than the rumoured sardine can and seat pitch was generous for a narrow body plane. Slimline seats didn't bother me much; it was pretty comfortable. Pretzel and beverages were served, which is awesome as some other airlines charge these. Cabin crew generous and enthusiastic as they made sure everyone got the beverages they wanted and offered a second one when asked. Flight circled over Atlantic City for 40 minutes as a result of severe weather hitting Reagan Airport. 2 rounds of trash-collecting service offered during the circling. There were connexting passengers onboard and flight attendants offered to check flight status for them. Landed an hour late and got held on the ground for another 30 minutes because of gate issues. Delays weren't really of airline's fault. Overall, a pleasant journey. As I haven't tried the long haul service yet, I don't really have much to say. However, I will definitely use American again for short haul flights."
2397,  Flew Las Vegas to Philadelphia. 3 out of my 4 flights were delayed which resulted in missing both of the important events that my entire trip was based around. They have not done anything to try to help at my request. I've oveheard from the passengers around me that American Airline has been very disappointing lately so this is not an unusual accurance. I do not recommend anyone fly this airline.
2398,Los Angeles to Toronto with American Airlines. I'm normally not a person who would use my time writing reviews online; however this has been my worst flight experience which prompted me to write this review. My flight was delayed two hours and on top of that the employees barely explained the situation as the terminal computer information has been misplaced causing everyone to ask each other admist the chaos. The previous flight has been delayed as well and droves of people ended up waiting for their flights to Philadelphia and Toronto at the same time. The gates ended up getting switched and even then we didn't get to board. After the employees shepherded all of us to the gate we still didn't get to board and they didn't even give us an ETD. The only time they gave us one was when we they said we would be able to board in ten and we then proceeded to wait another thirty plus minutes. Worst flight experience ever and I didn't even board yet.
2399,"  We just took American first class on a 777 from Dallas Fort Worth to Tokyo Narita. Got a good deal on the flight using miles, but if a deal is too good to be true, it usually is. This class of service should be called enhanced business class, at best. The seats are a bit narrow given the armrests, and hard as bricks. No duvet or other cover to make them into a real bed. They just lie flat. There's also one small pillow. No small light by your seat: if you want a reading light there's only intrusive spotlights in the ceiling panel. 2-together middle seats don't seem to have a partition that rises, which would give you sleeping privacy from a stranger. The bathroom showed a lot of use, with lots of tape and old tape remnants holding in place the toilet. Zero amenities in there, too. There were several lotions in a Cole Hann travel kit by your seat, but not one disposable razor nor shave cream nor comb. Dining was similar. Large portions, but bean counters were again counting. A salad with breakfast had lettuce and two halves of one (yes, one) cherry tomato. Nothing else, not a sliver of a olive nor a shred of onion. And for breakfast forget getting salt and pepper shakers and just rip open a paper packet. There's also no drink cart (a nice way to discourage consumption) and the wines were mostly the sort you find in upscale grocery stores. Stag's Leap is the Chardonnay and one of the reds is Montepulciano d'Abruzzo (not to be confused with the fine reds from Montepulciano in Tuscany). Service was spotty. My wife and I were together but I seemed to get dinner service about 10 minutes before her. And collecting headsets an hour before landing only accommodates the crew. There's nothing wrong with all this, since it is serviceable, just like economy motels. But if you're paying for something special, is it too much to expect something special? And if airlines are competing for higher-priced international travel, could American just loosen its purse-strings by, say, $99 a passenger in first class? It might make a real difference.
"
2400,"American uses dubious business practices when booking tickets. I booked tickets for a family of 4 weeks before the flight date. There were no available seats at the time except for the upgraded seats at premium prices. I checked daily for a month and no seats opened. I hoped to get seats when we got to the airport. When I checked in online 24 hours pre-flight, I checked seats again. Surprisingly there were 42 empty aisles and window seats now available. American wanted to sell out the middle seats first, then make you pay extra for an upgraded seat rather than make all the empty seats available. We got 2 aisle seats and 2 window seats in the same row. The plane was extremely small and the seats were closer together with less legroom than any of the other 7 carriers I've flown domestically this year - by a lot. When the seat in front of me reclined I had no room to read my iPad without propping it on the top of the seatback in front of me. This made for a very unpleasant flight. Further - all the cabin overhead lights were turned off for the entire flight. It was a red eye but there was no option to turn a light on if you wanted to. Whenever a passenger opened a window blind they were told by the flight crew to close it. This was supposedly to allow people to sleep (because nobody sleeps on day flights obviously) but in effect it minimized the work the cabin crew had to do since everyone was relegated to darkness and had little reason to ask for anything from them. The worst airline and the worst flight I've ever taken is an impressive one-two punch. Avoid American at all costs. I'll never fly them again."
2401,"  Extremely rude and unprofessional customer service at boarding desk. My wife, 13 year old daughter, 10 year old son and I were traveling from Barcelona to Philadelphia then from there to Los Angeles. In Barcelona we had a delay for 2 hours (sat in the airplane after boarding for 2 hours) therefore we missed our flight to LAX. In Philadelphia we were given new boarding passes for our flight to LAX. We got 4 seats in four different locations. When we asked the customer service agent at the boarding desk to change our seats to sit us together, she was so rude and unprofessional indicating the flight was full and she was not able to do so. This was incorrect because while we were waiting we noticed she was selling tickets to other people for the same flight as ours. I had to fight for them to rearrange our seats so that one parent sit with one child. It looks like they did not care about our concerns for our children sitting between two strangers in 6 hours night flight from coast to coast."
2402,"I travelled from El Paso to Syracuse with American Airlines for a business trip and this airline does not seem well organized. My flight was delayed 2 hours from El Paso and I missed my connecting flight. With an hour and a half layover in Chicago, I did not make it to Syracuse until midnight. On the return flight home, yet another delay in North Carolina caused me to miss my connection. Another delay in Phoenix occurred and both were due to the fact the aircraft departing had not arrived. The only nice thing is that they automatically accommodate booking issues. The flight snack is not very good and the service is mediocre. Not a good experience overall."
2403," Denver to Baton Rouge via Dallas with American Airlines. My flight was delayed an hour because of ""maintenance"" and during that hour they kept telling us 10 more minutes every 10 minutes. I missed my connecting flight because of the first delay. They gave me a hotel voucher, breakfast voucher, and a taxi voucher. What they don't tell you is that taxis can deny the voucher and that the hotel is 50 minutes away from the airport and won't accept the breakfast voucher. I will never fly AA again I would rather pay an extra to never experience this again."
2404,"New York JFK to Dublin with American Airlines. Checked in online the night before but shouldn't have bothered. At the airport we had to check in our bags and were issued with boarding cards again. The bag check has been automated and the system wouldn't record 2 of our 4 bags, support was poor and the lady who directed us to customer services to resolve the issue said there was no queue. We actually queued for 1.5 hours to resolve the issue. In total 2.5 hours to check 4 bags was ridiculous and the staff who were obvioulsy under pressure and disgruntled were very unhelpful. A lack of information all round meant that people were missing flights through no fault of their own. If this is new technolgy you expect problems but you resource it properly and American Airlines don't. The staff told me this happens every day - an abdication of responsibility by management then. By the time I got through security it was nailed on I will never fly with American Airlines again. Not to mention the standard of plane used across the Atlantic or my previous flight the week before from San Francisco to Philadelphia where I encountered the rudest crew I ever had the misfortune to be served by. If these staff feel and act like they do then AA have massive issues and custromers will be voting with their feet."
2405,"  First Class on American Airlines from Dallas Fort Worth to Seoul Incheon: cabin not bad, but service is terrible. The seat is comfy enough and makes a nice bed. Also interesting is how it moves around. But the video selection is truly poor and lacking in selection. The worse for me was the service. Truly pathetic. I had the only lady flight attendant in First Class. She was rude and nasty from the beginning. At one point I was having trouble opening the tray table. She uttered in anger ""it takes more strength"". She put the tray with food on my lap, angrily opened the table and left, leaving the food on my lap. Passengers traveling in this class pay a lot of money and the least they deserve is a little respect from those whose job it is to make them feel comfortable. It got so bad that I avoided her the rest of the flight. I have never been treated so rudely, not even on budget carriers. AA needs to train its staff better."
2406,"  Flew United Airlines from Los Angeles to Kahului. From the moment I stepped out of the car every employee was so rude. I selected seats when I made the reservation. They disappeared. I had to go to the customer service counter. At Los Angeles there were 2, yes only 2 employees at the counter. I was surrounded by self-service kiosks that would not address my issue. The line was incredibly long. An employee told me to go outside to the curb and use the curbside service to check in. I approached the employee and asked if he could check us in. He could not give me a direct answer. He had a terrible attitude and was condescending and rude. When he finally looked up the reservation he said he could not check us in because there was a problem. We went back to the line and started over again. Finally at the counter we got checked in. On the plane things didn't get any better. The service was so bad. The passenger next to me was traveling with a young child seated across the aisle. We moved around so the child could be sitting with one of his parents. The passenger asked if he could have 2 tiny snacks. The flight attendant adamantly refused stating only 1 was allowed. The passenger on my right asked the attendant if she could take her cup of water away. The attendant said - ""I can't do that right now"" and never returned. Granted these are minor issues but the attitude of every single employee was so rude. This is a service industry. There are so many choices. This was by far the worst choice I have made. I booked 5 tickets and selected seats. My seat assignment disappeared and we were randomly seated. This was the beginning of a very unpleasant flight. We have a reasonable expectation that as paying customers we will treated pleasantly. Never again."
2407,"I was pleasantly surprised to find myself in a 777-200 plane on this two hour domestic route from New York JFK to Chicago. The flight was fine in every respect - departures and arrivals on time, a hot breakfast served - had two options to choose from, a hot towel to refresh was provided at take-off, and a blanket was available. Cabin attendants were very attentive. The business class seats are angled and lie down fully flat through I did not take advantage of this feature on such a short flight - the touch controls were easy to use. The selection of movies and TV fare was good enough - ""disposable"" headsets were provided on request. My seat faced the plane's rear and with the seats being angled the passenger across the aisle (whose seat faced the front of the plane) was directly in my sight line. This was a bit intrusive and disconcerting as each of us could see what we were doing throughout the flight. This was my first experience with this sort of seating arrangement and I felt a distinct loss of privacy."
2408,Flew Philadelphia to Ottawa. If you love getting places late this American Airlines is for you. Mechanical difficulties with all flights I've been on. They are the least reliable airline I've flown with. Seems like everything they do puts you one step behind on your trip. My flight home to Ottawa they had us wait 2 hours well they tried to fix the door of the plane. After that amount of time they game up and got us to another plane. This new plane had a faulty cockpit seat so now we're blessed with another 2 hour wait. Could have been home 2 hours ago now. Great service!
2409,"  We booked a vacation via Travelocity in early March for this June. About three weeks later, we get an email saying that our flight has been changed to leave three hours and a half hours earlier, creating a 4 hour layover in Dallas before heading to our real destination of Cozumel. They also changed our return flight to arrive at a completely different airport on the opposite side of the city (about an hour away). This flight also included more layover time. I tried to check in online the night before our flight and checked my bags. I wanted to make sure that we could get in and on the plane quickly and easily. This is the best way to travel through any other airlines I've been on. Not so with American Airlines. It was upon checking in and checking my bags and feeling this great relief that a few minutes later I get the dreaded email - they changed our flight again, just hours before our flight. This time they added another 2 hours layover in Dallas making it a 6 hour layover and it's leaving two hours earlier. We were already booked on a dawn flight. Please keep in mind that flying directly to Cozumel from Houston is only 2 hours total. Since we are flying this airline, we are flying first to a more northern location to wait more than half a day and then back south to our final destination. We arrive at the airport without any sleep because they didn't tell us until 9 pm that they were changing our flight to 5:10 AM. The airport is an hour from our house and this is an international flight, so we had to leave our house by 2 am to get there on time for customs. We actually decided to leave even earlier since we couldn't sleep anyway and got to the airport by 2:30 AM. This is two hours and forty minutes before our flight and there is no one at the ticketing booth. In fact, they had a long line and all the passengers were worried about missing their flights. No one came to the booth until just past 3 am and still took on average 25 minutes for each group of travelers. We didn't get to security until about 50 minutes before our flight and they almost didn't let us on. In fact, one of the security ladies chewed me out because I was feeling antsy and worried about making my flight. She barked that I should have gotten to to the airport well before my flight. I was. It was American Airlines fault for not being at their ticketing booth on time, nor having enough agents to check in their passengers. They are the ones who moved our flight to the middle of the night without our permission, and without any options to change this. It's not our fault they don't have staff to deal with these changes they inflict on their clients.  I am actually on the plane and I am going to try to move past how upsetting this whole experience is and that I will waste a full day of my vacation without any sleep and stuck in an airport north of my destination and departing city. The only thing that gives me peace of mind in all of this is that there are other options/airlines in the future because I will never fly with them again after my return flight, which I pray they don't screw up too. We leave tomorrow afternoon for home on this airline. All of this and they charged us baggage fees when I originally checked in online and then charged again when we checked in at the airport because American Airlines had to modify our return flight. They have yet to reimburse for the duplicate charges."
2410,"Chicago to San Diego with American Airlines (AA2204) in First Class. Friendly bag-check at the counter - typical overload at TSA precheck. Boarding was on-time and a friendly welcome by the gate agent. Smiles from the flight attendants when getting on the plane - and I watched and they were that way with all the passengers. On-time take off and 3:40 min flying time. Served drinks and nuts, a nice lunch with chicken-breast and salad, dessert and veggies. Pretty tasty. The inflight entertainment was overhead screens with some generic movie and NBC shows - not the best but most people were using wifi or their own devices. Pilots were very communicative and kept us abreast of the journey. Hard landing in San Diego but arrived 15 minutes early and bags out in average time. Good job AA - it's the smiles and friendly service that made this trip memorable."
2411,"Seattle to Madison via Dallas with American Airlines. Another horrible experience plagued by last minute flight cancelation, rebooking mistakes by the airline, and incompetent customer service. Luckily after hours on the phone and a trip to the airport American finally followed through on rebooking me to a United flight. Unfortunately I was not so lucky on my return. For that leg I had to fly American. It began with delay after delay, enough to make me miss my connection and be told I would be stranded in Dallas until the following day, no explanation given and staff showed no interest. Finally landed in Dallas after an hour delay to find there is no plane for my connecting flight anyway. Constant gate changes and finally after a 3 hour wait we departed on a dirty plane with damaged seats. We finally landed at 1am and were forced to walk across the tarmac (no jet bridge) in the dark to find our own luggage. I have had many bad experiences with this airline but this is it, I'm done. I doubt that they care but I will not fly American again."
2412,"Flew Dallas to Denver, no more American Airlines for my family. So tired of delayed flights and then standing at the baggage claim for thirty minutes and still no luggage. I say no more every time and then end up giving ""one more chance"" but not this time. Finally arrived two and a half hours late and are still waiting on our luggage."
2413,"I had a very bad experience with American Airlines. I bought the ticket and paid extra fee for preferred seat. At the end, the flight cancelled. I was given for a different flight with different departure time, this flight was delayed and my trip end up cancelled again because there was no connection flight for me. Finally, they booked me for the next day flight at noon time. I had to call in to talk to customer service to because I had to be there earlier for my meeting. They did book me for 7:00am fight with a seat 9c. When I got to the airport with my boarding pass on hand and the seat printed on there, they told me no seat available for me. So I had to wait until everyone finished boarding and then they assigned me a seat (from 9c now move to 28a. This is very ver bad experience. I paid for the date that I wanted to flight and paid extra money for preferred seat. At the end my trip was moved to next day (3 times) and from seated preferred to non-seated. "
2414,"  I have flown American Airlines about 5 times now and only one flight has gone right. None of my flights are ever on time. I'm currently dealing with my third delay today flying from Dallas Fort Worth to Los Angeles because they can't find the captain. I can completely understand if it were a weather related issue however this is simply an organization issue. Not to mention how I called for assistance multiple times on the plane only to be ignored. This will be the last time I fly with AA, avoid them at all costs."
2415,"  The American Airlines flight from Boston to Charlotte was pleasant with the seating very nice - large blue leather seats - adequate leg room but not overly generous - and even though the flight left at 6.05am no food except a snack of cakes provided, which on a flight of about an hour and a half seems a little on the skimpy side. Since the flight left from the old US Airways terminal in Boston the Admirals lounge was an old US Airways lounge, pleasant, but not overly comfortable. On board staff very pleasant and attentive. A brief stay at the Admirals Club (again, old US Airways) lounge in Charlotte with only oatmeal and breads provided. The flight to St Louis was on a new A319. I will admit that after reading other reviews of that plane I was a bit dubious but in fact found the small (8 seat) first class cabin quite comfortable. Again, no catering except cookies and treats, the the wonderful flight attendant was very attentive and liberal with the drinks. In all, a very pleasant experience with all flight departing and arriving on time."
2416,"  Current flight has been delayed by 1 hr and 45 minutes. Airline did not post delay until boarding time, which made it impossible to change flights. Now I will not make my connecting flight in Miami. They have rebooked me onto a route that is so inconvenient that it will get me there at 1am. I have been at JFK since 6am. That means I'll have been traveling 19 hours by the time I land at my destination. "
2417,"I flew from Washington - Hartford with American Airlines, one way on a very nice ex-US Air A319. This was right after the AA-US merger, so I expected worse-than-normal service. However, the flight and experience went surprisingly well. Ticket was only 89 dollars, cheap compared to JetBlue, the only other airline providing Bradley service. There was no delay, and the service was quick at the airport. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the A319 was wearing the Pacific Southern ""smile"" heritage livery. While on the plane, I was surprised to find that the interior was not yet retrofitted, meaning the seats were not as comfortable as advertised, as well as temporarily nonfunctional power plugs. I had a decent amount of legroom, even being 6'2"", and although the journey was barely over one and a half hours, free soft drinks and pretzels. Getting off the plane was quick and easy, with nice cabin crew. AA had great service; I will definitely fly again on this route again when the merger and retrofitting will have been completed."
2418,"We used to fly to Cancun and Mazatlan on US Airways and got great flights at reasonable prices. Ever since American took over the prices are insane and the flights are horrible. I used to pay under $500 for October (it is still hurricane season) and now I have to pay $700. I purposely booked a red eye that would get me in at 10 am and just got a notice saying it was changes to a 6am flight getting in late in the afternoon. Now my friend and I have paid and there's nothing we can do about it. You used to be able to go through Phoenix and have a short layover on the way down, now most flights are through LA or Dallas and have two stops instead of one. We just booked two trips and pretty much used up our air miles so from now on we'll use our capital one card so we can choose a different airline. "
2419,"  Flying American Airlines is one of the worst experiences I've had in a while. Not only was I given a 1 hour notice that my flight from Dallas Fort Worth to Washington Reagan had been cancelled, and rebooked for the following day, causing me to miss work, but then my bag was checked when there was plenty room on the plane. I said I didn't want to check it, but they did it any way because it 'didn't fit the size requirements'. However it fit in my departure flight. I argued that if it was the same plane then it should fit on the flight returning to DC. They refused, yet allowed larger bags to go after mine. I thought flying Spirit Airlines was bad, but now I have two airlines that I will avoid in the future.
"
2420,"  American Airlines forced me to check a bag I brought on the plane on my outbound flight and approved in at the security line, I would have been in group 2 sot here would have been plenty of space for it. However, now I've been sitting on the plane for over an hour and haven't moved from gate for my flight from Phoenix to New York JFK. Ten mins more they keep saying. Never again will I fly AA, seats too small for anyone over 5 ft. Crew just sitting around while we all are sitting here thirsty, you would think they would at least offer water - horrible experience."
2421," Charlotte to Detroit with American Airlines. Packed mainline A319. No service whatsoever on a nearly 2-hour flight - not even water. Flight attendants ignored the call button. There was no turbulence, therefore the reason for this total lack of service remained unknown. I wonder whether this is the ""new normal."" Seat 9D (""main cabin extra"") had adequate legroom but was extremely narrow, so the overweight passenger in 9E constantly ""spilled over"" into my seat. Cannot recommend American in domestic coach over the discount carriers. Even Spirit and Southwest do better. (Spirit makes it clear that everything costs money and is happy to sell water and Southwest provides free drinks on flights of similar duration)."
2422,"  Both American Airlines flights from St Louis to Boston via Chicago were a few minutes late departing but were early arriving. The attendants were wonderful and very attentive. I don't really care much for the seating on the new B737 - they are too low to support my back properly. One this I don't understand is why passengers will be loaded before maintenance is performed and that we have to wait. The food served on the ORD/BOS segment of the trip was very good. Overall a good, pleasant trip."
2423,"Flew Dallas to Mexico. When you think the seats cannot get any smaller, well, yes they can. American Airlines started providing these premium economy seats with extra space for your legs, however, instead of eliminating a row they just made every single other seat smaller - it's ridiculously small. Extremelly disappointed and I plan on switching my preferred airline for now."
2424, Birmingham to New York via Charlotte with American Airlines. This was a round trip. In both directions one of my flights was cancelled. Both cancellations were due to unavailability of the pilots. Weather was not a factor. Before my outbound trip the airline failed to inform me my original flight was cancelled and that my new flight would leave from a different airport. Overall an approximately 4 hour route ended up taking me 10 hours outbound and 8 hours for the return. Customer service seemed ambivalent to the massive inconvenience the airline was causing. In the future I will make every effort to avoid American Airlines.
2425," Washington Dulles to Toronto via Charlotte with American Airlines. The first flight was delayed so we would miss the connecting flight. No apologies - told to go and find staff in Charlotte to find out what options we have. Once in Charlotte, we were informed the next flight to Toronto was cancelled and offered a flight to JFK and then to Toronto the next day. The lady at the counter asked me to sleep in the airport for the night, I declined the offer and elected to stay in a hotel - no apologies once again and no help with hotels. Next day I reached JFK, only to find the next flight is delayed 4 hours. I left Dulles for a 1 hour flight trusting American Airlines and now for the second day it is late evening I am still stuck with no hope of reaching Toronto. Worst experience, I should have walked."
2426,"Back in January, I booked a direct flight from JAX (Jacksonville, FL) to ORD (O'Hare-Chicago, IL) through Expedia. My family and I were returning home from my niece's graduation and my son had school the following day. The flight number was 4266 and it was scheduled to leave JAX at 5.20pm and arrive at ORD at 7.09pm. About a month later Expedia called and stated that American had dropped that flight and we would need to reschedule. The only available flights that would get us home at a decent hour was to go from JAX to CLT (Charlotte, NC) at 4.54pm-6.15pm and then CLT to ORD at 7.05-9.14pm. Certainly not what I wanted, but better than nothing. This was all for a flight on May 23rd, 2016. We arrived at the airport about 2.30pm and proceeded to our gate. So much for the long security line. Sometime after that, we received an alert from Expedia that our flight was delayed by 30 minutes. About 5 minutes later, Expedia alerted us that our flight was now an hour late. Still nothing from American even though they had my email, phone number and I had the American Airline app on my phone all setup for alerts. About 5 minutes after the second Expedia alert American finally sent an alert via phone call that our flight was 30 minutes late. That was the only notice we received from American outside of the announcements at the gate that did not start until later. I knew we would miss our connecting flight so I went to the gate to inquire about a later flight from CLT to ORD. I was informed that they automatically pushed us back to the 10.35 flight from CLT to ORD. Nice to have a seat but where was the notification? Not to mention that the flight was not schedule to land at ORD until 11.44pm. A little late for my son to be out on a school night. I was also told by the person working the gate that my original direct flight was being put back on the schedule in June. Very nice of her to point that out, especially when it didn't help me at the time. Or maybe I could have just stayed at the airport another few weeks. Our flight out of JAX ended up 2 1/2 hours late giving us enough time to get to the gate in CLT with about 15 minutes to spare. Thank goodness we had carry-ons only. Our flight to ORD was slightly delayed but not too bad. The flight attendant forgot to offer my wife and I our complimentary beverage during service. I had to ask her for a drink and she seemed put off that I did so. I called customer service to complain as I had paid a premium originally for a direct flight, was bumped to a cheaper flight and was now bumped again to an even cheaper flight. They said they could not help me and I needed to send an email to customer relations. So I did explaining exactly what happened and how I was now also going to need to spend money on a meal at the airport that I did not plan to do. And we all know those are not cheap. American Airlines response to me was that services were provided. I will never fly American again and will never recommend them."
2427,"Flew Manchester to JFK with American Airlines. Horrible airline to fly with - they're on a par with Ryanair in terms of space in the seat, not ideal for flying beyond 2 or 3 hours. I had to lean sideways to the next seat (luckily, my husband's) so I could store my bag under the seat in front. They didn't have enough of both meals to cover everyone so by the time they got to me the only option I had was pasta, which I can't eat. On the whole, the JFK staff were not nice but the American Airlines staff were very rude to everyone, rolling their eyes and moaning to each other loudly about passengers. It was disgraceful behaviour. Our flight was fully boarded on time when we got an announcement saying the essential engine checks had started late so we'd be leaving 'in about half an hour'. Forty minutes later we were still sat on the runway. Two hours later we were still on the runway, queuing behind 17 other planes waiting to take off. We weren't even offered water during this time. Never again."
2428," New York JFK to London Heathrow with American Airlines - never had such a bad experience travelling with children. Not given the chance to sit together - only at check in was I offered the choice to take the last row near the galley and restroom. I was in the last group to board and when I finally boarded the plane I was told that there is no space for our hand luggage. Staff didn't help me and no apology - it took me a long time and I finally found space about 20 rows before my seat. My kids had all there food and games in there but I wasn't able to access it. I later found out the luggage space above our seats was saved for the flight attendants. The smell from the galley was terrible and the flight attendants were laughing and talking loud, so unhelpful - I will never travel with AA again."
2429,"  Another customer stated this, and I could not agree more: ""I know American can't control the weather, but they can teach their agents to not add insult to injury in a difficult situation."" I'm currently sitting at Charlotte Airport, having faced a flight that was delayed yesterday afternoon due to poor weather in the area. Though things looked clear down below, we circled for an hour and a half before being diverted to Greensboro to wait out the storm. From there, however, we were delayed another two hours waiting on fuel and gate accessibility and just general disorder in an airport clearly ill equipped to deal with the diversion. By the time we made it back to Charlotte, there were too many planes there to get anyone who was even close to making their connection into the airport - at this point what was meant to be a 2 hour flight had taken 5.5 hours. Stood in a never-ending line waiting for rude customer service and spent the night sleeping on Reagan-era chairs. The next morning we were treated like second class citizens, shuttled from gate to gate waiting on standby flights like we were looking for a handout and hadn't paid a hefty price to book in the first place. It's one thing to have weather impact the flight experience; that's no one's fault. But to treat paying customers like they're an inconvenience to the airline and previously ticketed passengers the following morning is unacceptable. I'm going to board this flight back to San Francisco, simmer, de-plane and never fly American Airlines again. "
2430, Punta Cana to Chicago via Philadelphia with American Airlines. Our plane left Punta Cana late because AA couldn't fit all their commercial cargo on correctly and it had to be removed. We were 10 minutes late for our connection and although AA knew of the delay for 4 hours they made no provision to provide transport to the gate or delay the connecting flight 8 minutes. We had to stay the night in Philadelphia. We got the 5am flight out the next day but sat on the tarmac for 2 hours and then told the plane couldn't fly. We were delayed another 4 hours. American Airlines is incompetent and we have to endure their inability to provide basic service.
2431,"Heathrow to New York JFK with American Airlines. For the price, AA is the best I've experienced so far in Economy. Definitely the best value for the money. Seats are nothing to cheer for, but they are definitely okay. I could sit in the middle seat without much discomfort. It's not like I could stretch out my legs or anything but it's called Economy for a reason. Food was good. Choices were a vegetarian pasta dish, or chicken with rice. I had the chicken. and it was good as far as airline food goes. The bread, cheese, salad and brownie that went along with it were also good. A nicely varied meal. Drinks, including beer and wine were complimentary. Unfortunately all they had for beer was Budweiser but what else can you expect from AA? This was a good crew. No fake smiles - they were just regular people treating me like a regular person. Efficient, and I felt completely safe with them. Entertainment was great. Screens were big enough, and the picture quality was good. Good selection of movies, from new blockbusters to old classics. The complimentary earbuds were actually good, considering they were free. The flight did have WiFi on board, but I couldn't get it to connect. Don't know if it was because of the connection or my device. I would fly with AA again, and I am fairly certain that I will soon. I am giving this review a 10, based on my own experience. Out of all long haul flights I have made personally, I enjoyed AA the most."
2432,"  Flew American Airlines from Los Angeles to Miami. Boarding started at 9.15pm, at 9.30pm there was no more room for carry-on luggage and they asked everyone to check their carry-on luggage in. I was carrying my camera and very fragile items in my bag, however I couldn't take this onboard with me while they let some people board with more than 1 carry-on. They were talking to people like a flock of sheep. One was shouting at a lady ""Hey, pink T-shirt, boarding pass!"" No apologies for the inconvenience they were putting us through. The worst thing was that they had nothing to eat for a 5 hour flight, no sandwiches or salads, only cheese. The entertainment on board - I have no words to describe it. The free movies were from the 90's, if you want to watch the latest releases you have to pay $7.99 per movie. "
2433,"  I fly very regularly within the US for business and almost always use Alaska. This time I had to opt out with flying American Airlines on the way back to Seattle from Philadelphia and it was the worst travel experience I have had in years. In Philadelphia: the flight was overbooked. The plane was old, but my seats were okay because I paid extra for preferred seats and sat in the front area. Once onboard, it turned out that there was an issue with their A/C. At first we were told it would take a ""few minutes"", 15-20 min later, this was extended to ""30 min, at best"". After over an hour we were told this may take up to 2 hours and another 10 mins later finally asked to deplane. I had a connecting flight in Chicago following a layover of just over 2 hours - which meant that the connection was no more. After talking to the gate agent I was put on a new connection, from Philly to Charlotte and then to Seattle. Of course, my careful seat selection that I did during booking was gone. The plane I then got onto was old, seats old and cramped so tightly together I couldn't even sit straight. I could not reach anywhere once the table was unfolded. I sat in the very back, center seat, all of which was the opposite of what I had paid money for so that I would not have to endure it. Suffice to say: this flight again was delayed, over half an hour. Finally in Charlotte, off to the next flight: pretty much the same thing, except that this one at least had wifi. However, since American Airlines does like to overbook their flights they now collected my carry on because all overheads were full, although I told them I was already late and needed to run once we arrived in Seattle. To no avail, customers needs don't matter. And of course it left delayed. We landed at 8.42 and the baggage claim carousel started running at 9.21 - nearly 40 minutes. I finally had my carry-on back and it was past 9.30. "
2434,"Flew American Airlines from San Francisco to New York. Food was okay, flight time was okay, arrived early and seats were normal/expected level of comfort. Service was for the most fairly quick but the flight attendants have the worst attitude I've encountered on any airline. Rude looks when you press the bell to ask for something, as though it isn't their job and you're inconveniencing them. Honestly wouldn't choose to fly them again. Lagging well behind other airlines, the company should do some mystery shopping to see how their attendants behave when they think no one is there to see."
2435,"  My flight was cancelled the evening before ""due to weather"" in Dallas. Even though most of it didn't materialize. I was to leave at 7am. I was told the only other available flight on any airline would be at 11.30am. I was told I couldn't be put on a wait list but I could standby for an earlier flight. So I arrived early only to discover that I could have been put on a standby list. I did not get on the earlier flights because so many others were already on the standby list and the 11.30 was nearly an hour late. I had to check my bag at the gate (not for gate pickup though) because, even though I am a relatively frequent flyer, had been delayed 5 hours, I was given last boarding priority. I am a patient person, but the complete lack of empathy about a situation that was causing a hardship really needs attention. I know American can't control the weather, but they can teach their agents to not add insult to injury in a difficult situation."
2436,"American Airlines from Detroit to Manchester, UK via Philadelphia. They rescheduled my flight for no reason. I only received robot calls. I need to be in UK for a conference on 5/26. I planned to leave on 5/25, which is today. But when I was about to leave home, their robot called me and said my flight was delayed and they will have to reschedule me to tomorrow's flight. I called back to their toll free number, they just transferred me from one person to another person, and no one could really help. The most ridiculous thing is that I checked my flight status online, it was only 10 min late. I would not affect my connection at all. I called back again, they said they don't know if it will be more delayed and I will not be able to make it to the flight to UK. So I said, I want to canceled the tickets. They said, this number can only rebook your ticket. If you needed to cancel the ticket, you need to talk to ticket department. The ticket department transferred me to vacation department. No one can solve my problem. They just want the money from my pocket. I said I want to file a complaint, they said they don't have a number for complaints, I can only email! I said I want to talk to someone for refund, again, I can only email!  And I just checked my flight status. It was on time. So they just rebooked me for no reason.  They just oversell the tickets and rebook people with lies."
2437,"Philadelphia to Athens on American Airlines A330-300. We had almost an hour's delay at Philadelphia because the video screens were not functioning.  Finally we took off and all went well until halfway when the video screens went black - and they announced they are trying to solve the problem. This they did after more than two hours without any videos or announcements. Surprisingly the food was very good and so was inflight service, although no reading material of any kind was available. There was practically no inflight announcement on this 10 hour flight until we approached Athens with an hour's delay. "
2438,"  Chicago to Las Vegas. I fly quite often, and I had yet to have an experience like this one. American Airlines staff were very low energy in some instances, even rude. When the food cart came around, I asked them what they had and the guy pushing the cart gave me a strange look and said ""didn't you look at the menu?"". When I said I didn't see one in the seat pocket, he said ""look again and get back to me"" and then left - I didn't see him again for the rest of the flight. The woman serving drinks was noticeably annoyed that I asked for coffee and orange juice. The seats were uncomfortable, the whole thing was pretty awful. I'd have to say that out of all of the airlines I've been on, and there have been quite a few, American Airlines is the WORST. I won't be using them again. You shouldn't either."
2439,"Saint Martin to Philadelphia with American Airlines. I am 27 years old and my mother is 62. In all our years of travel neither of us had ever experienced anything like our flight out of Saint Martin yesterday. We booked a direct flight that left at 2:40PM and was to land in Philadelphia at 7:13PM. When we boarded the plane we were told we would arrive in Philadelphia early and were very pleased by this news. However, after a short time the pilot told us that there was something wrong with the plane. ""Something"" with no further detail as to what was wrong or how long it would take to repair. After 2 hours of waiting in the plane, we were told that the plane was repaired and would be able to fly. The pilot informed us however that due to ""legal issues"" we would not be able to fly to Philadelphia as planned, which was an estimated 4 hours and 35 minutes, instead we would be flying to Miami a 3 hour and 15 minute flight. We were not told anything other than that. We were then given the option to leave the plane but were told we would not be provided a room. About 40 minutes later we took off for Miami. We landed in Miami and waited on the tarmac for over an hour. Were told that we would be greeted by individuals who would tell us where to go and would take us step by step through customs and our return to the 10:30 flight from Miami to PHL. There was no one there to greet us when we arrived and no one to direct us through customs and security. We went through customs and were required to go through TSA security, despite not leaving the airport or having time to purchase anything. Once we arrived at our flight we were delayed in boarding and did not take off until after 11:30. We arrived in Philadelphia at around 2:00 and there was no one from AA to greet us or speak to. We waited, as a group, for our luggage for over 45 minutes before it began to come out. I am extremely disappointed with how disorganized and unapologetic this airline was. If I can avoid using AA in the future I intend to."
2440,Flew American Airlines from Sioux City Iowa to Dallas Texas. I was supposed to have a two hour layover and then fly to Houston. After they canceled the first plane I ended up waiting four hours for the next one. Which got canceled. Then the third one had mechanical problems and was going to be delayed for another three hours. I ended up getting a Hertz rent car which cost me an additional $100 because it was an airport Hertz to drive the rest of the way. I was almost late to my daughters first birthday because of this stupid airline. I am so displeased with this flight that I just spent $500 for Southwest to take me back home. Total I have spent $1200. I will never use this airline again. This is the third time I have been messed over by them.
2441,"Paris CDG to Chicago. Hard to believe American Airlines international Boeing 767's have no in seat entertainment. The video monitors that loop poor movies and TV shows are completely inadequate and 20+ years behind the times. Absolutely inconceivable and they've had plenty of time to retrofit. Extremely long queues at CDG for check in as well. On the positive side, flight departed 20 minutes early and arrived an hour early due to lack of headwinds."
2442,"  Chicago to San Juan. American Airlines website is poorly designed, unreliable - failed numerous times to record a change. Booked my flight over a month in advance and the only aisle seats shown were $35 - $90 ""upgrade"". Tried within 24 hrs of flight time to change to ""available"" aisle seat showing on website, failed 3 times to record it. Couldn't check in at San Juan till 4 hours before flight and no aisle seats left except the upgrade ones."
2443,"Chicago to London with American Airlines. I have flown AA domestic a couple of times and it wasn't anything to write home about but not awful. I just flew my first international flight with AA and it was pretty horrible. I have a small carry on luggage that I have had for 10 years and have only had to check it once because of weight not for size. Today I had my liquids bag in the front pocket which was making it bulge a bit and when getting ready to board was told it would not fit in the overhead bin I would have to check it. I tried to ask the agent if I could put my liquids bag in the main compartment and they said that it still wouldn't meet the size requirements, that I would have to check it. I showed them that it would fit but they still forced me to check my bag. The flight itself was average, they don't have individual seat TV screens so you were forced to watch poor movies and re-runs of NBC shows such as Chicago Fire, The Tonight Show etc with a ton of commercials which was very bad for a 7 hour flight. The seats were very uncomfortable and we were packed in, any other international economy flight I have taken this was not the case. I have flown Delta internationally many times before and will be choosing them over AA anytime in the future."
2444,"Edinburgh to New York with American Airlines. Having just flown almost around the world, and changing to AA to fly return to New York I was most disappointed. Bearing in mind this is a 7 hour flight, the inflight entertainment was extremely poor. In this day and age all decent airlines provide a generous choice of movies / music to fill the time. Not only did AA have ceiling screens, their choice of movies was abysmal. The food going was ok however coming home the food was terrible and in fact inedible. My travelling companion was charged on the outgoing flight for a gin and tonic but this was complimentary on the return trip? All in all I will not book American again unless they are prepared to move forward with their competition and provide up to date amenities and friendly staff."
2445," Miami to New York JFK with American Airlines. We flew in the new first class cabin, we were initially turned away at boarding by the desk staff as we were row 11 and row 12 who said ""you are not first class"" and we had to explain ourselves so not the warmest welcome. Once on the plane my daughter was freezing cold so we asked for a blanket and we were told in an annoyed manner that we should have bought a jacket and there were no blankets. I've never been spoken to in such a nasty manner on an airplane in my life, I thought I must have caught a hostess having a bad day so I walked to the galley and asked another staff member and she said the same thing. When we disembarked we passed a few seats with cushions and blankets. I really don't know why the staff were being so unpleasant, we are not demanding passengers at all, infact we only had a glass of water on the whole flight as we planned to eat at JFK before our flight back to London on BA and my goodness what a difference in attitude from the BA staff, they were absolutely lovely."
2446,"  My wife and 8 month old daughter had a flight from Chicago to Atlanta on 7th May. I was little worried as to how my wife would manage everything during flight. The flight staff made the experience smooth. The staff were helpful and courteous, they even assigned a seat for my daughter so this meant my wife could sit comfortably. The staff took care of her luggage, took the bags at the gates and put them in the overhead bins near her seat. When my wife needed some toys for my daughter, they took the bag out and helped her take out what she needed and put the bags back. Because of the support from staff the journey was very comfortable and enjoyable.
"
2447,"  American Airlines forced me to check in my carry one luggage only because it was 0.5 inches too big in one direction. In addition, I had to pay for it! The suitcase was fine when I was flying to Philadelphia but on my way back, all of a sudden, it was too big. Also, the flight was half empty with at least 20 empty seats so I do not understand why I was forced to check in my small suitcase. I noticed that a couple with two little children had the same suitcase but in black and they did not have to check it in. A stupid way to try to make extra money. I am not flying American again!"
2448,"  Des Moine to San juan via Dallas. Today, Mothers day, my dad wanted to bring me home as a surprise for my mom. Mrs. The American Airlines counter attendant wanted to charge me $265.00 for my two checked bags because supposedly they were oversize. They were not. I did not have the complete amount with me and she did not want to accept any other form of payment. We tried everything from instant transfers to my accounts but because the amout it would take three days to show in my account. A prepaid American card for the bag fees takes two hours so I would not make that flight and not make it home for Mothers day. My dad instructed me to check in without bags and throw them away. The counter staff did not mind doing that, so with my boarding pass in hand I asked her fellow co-worker to show me a garbage disposal for my bags. He was completly shocked and did not allow me to leave without my bags. He charged me $25.00 and I am on my way home! People like the first counter attendant are the ones that caused American Airlines bankcrutcy, it is sad people like her co-worker pay jointly for her attitude toward clients. "
2449,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Columbus via Charlotte with American Airlines. First leg of my flight was good, but second leg of flight was delayed numerous times - as always the gate attendants are slow if at all sharing information. Per the gate attendant, the flight is being delayed because one of the flight attendants hasn't shown up, not a pilot or co pilot but a flight attendant. If American cannot even schedule the personnel why should I think they can get me to my destination on time. Shame on you AA your customer service really sucks."
2450,"I flew American Airlines from Washington to Seoul via Dallas Ft Worth. The check in was smooth and lounge was acceptable. Friendly crew for the first sector. The problem was on the plane from Dallas to Seoul. I flew Business Class and the seats were angled lie flat. Very uncomfortable for a 14+hr flight. The food was average. However, the crew was so rude. When I asked for a shoehorn, they said that AA did not offer shoehorns, even in Business Class. When I asked why the airline didn't have a shoehorn, they told me not to fly with them. I called the purser and no apology given. Terrible service."
2451,"  Dallas Ft Worth to Las Vegas. We arrived to the gate minutes before takeoff time and were told our seats were given to standby passengers. We were offered to try standby on full flights or to be confirmed for $150 for an evening flight. In none of the confirmation emails we received were we told that our tickets could be given away. It was mentioned that doors close 10 minutes prior to departure and we made that timeline. Everybody we dealt with was rude, with zero effort for customer service."
2452,"New York JFK to Milan with American Airlines. The flight was fine, and food and drinks were acceptable. The crew was friendly and efficient. We left on time and arrived early, and who could wish for more? I could! There was no personal entertainment, only a few drop down screens. For an 8 hour flight we could have had a plane with decent IFE."
2453,"  Amsterdam to Toronto via Philadelphia. It was my first time and my last time flying with American Airlines. Right from departing from Amsterdam, the not so comfortable journey back home began. The crew was not friendly, in a rush to pick up things right after they served and a smelly blanket. Then came the painful part after landing in Philadelphia. My flight was supposed to take off at 3:30 pm. The ground staff informed us that there is an issue with the plane and the waiting process began. Three hours after the wait we're notified that the plane will not be taking off and we will be put on another flight coming in at 7pm. The flight came in at 7pm as scheduled, people got off and then the screen flashed with no prior warning ""flight cancelled"" and we were all left to fend for ourselves. I was responsible to find my own flight since AA incompetent ground staff cannot do anything except for give me a number to call. I finally got put on a American Eagle flight departing at 8:30pm, but that flight got delayed as well and did not take off till 10pm. There was not a single apology from AA for the fiasco. I learnt a good lesson to never fly with AA again since they don't really care for the people other giving them false and incorrect information time after again."
2454,"  Los Angeles to London Heathrow with American Airlines. The food was poor, but worse was the assistance I had booked because of mobility problems. In Los Angeles this was fine, but in London it was appalling. Too few people providing assistance, no wheelchairs waiting for people who needed them (4 or 5 on my flight), long waits for wheelchairs, long queues for seemingly non-existent buggies. I don't understand why Heathrow cannot get this right, where we received appalling treatment. "
2455,"  Tampa to Chicago with my wife and baby, this first flight with American airlines was fantastic. Checkin was smooth, kind and helpful ground staff. Fast track security was fast. Lounge was quiet and nice with a view of one runway. Alcoholic beverages were not included in the lounge. Boarding was smooth and friendly cabin crew offered us champagne once seated. During the flight lunch we ordered when booking was served. We really enjoyed this flight."
2456,"  Washington to Columbus with American Airlines. Typical story - delayed 8 minutes, then 30 minutes, then 45 minutes, etc until it reached 4 hours. The reason given was ""We have no crew."" I wish I could use that excuse at my job.  What a terrible company this is. I fly frequently and American is just bad."
2457,"  This was the first time in a long time (15 plus years) that I flew on an American Airlines flight. Flew from San Diego to Miami. It was the worst flight I have flown in the last 15 years. The seats felt like sitting on a concrete slab. As a red-eye flight the service was terrible. The entire crew felt like they were being put out of their way in all their duties. It was a 5 hour plus flight and there was not even a small bag of chips provided. The inservice video was not working from my seat with nothing that could be done. On the return flight a week later, another lazy crew was on board. At one point I went to use the lavatory at the rear of the plane and both crew members were sitting in their seats in the last row of the plane talking. In front of the galley was a mother and young daughter who were being shouted at by one of the crew because they had helped themselves to something in the galley. I just hope I never get into another situation where I have no choice but to fly on an American Airlines flight. They are by far the worst to use in my belief.
"
2458,"  Oakland to JFK,New York via Phoenix with American Airlines. Last minute tickets due to a sudden tragic family death. Huge price paid since discount for traveling under circumstances caused by a death refused/eliminated. Made to sit trapped in a plane for an hour delay due to a ""tire issue."" No temperature control and no crowd control within the plane. I watched the three mechanics below remove the tire, lay it on the tarmac and then appear to be standing around. With a hot, full plane of passengers watching them out the window--you would think they'd work like a racing pit crew, but not them. Took off 1 hour late. Caused missed plane-change connecting flight. No even basic customer service given from gate agents nor the flight attendants about getting us out of Phoenix and home that night though we desperately asked for assistance. Some planes were held so people could make the connection, ours was not with no reason given. We we got on the last American flight out that night only because a nice guy working for the Phoenix airport had a motorized cart and he knew of the last American flight out of there that night and raced us over to it. American gate agent yelled at us as if it were our fault to be arriving late. We incurred a $100 taxi fare because the last plane was to San Francisco instead of Oakland. On JFK to Phoenix leg, multiple passengers and children were allowed to ignore the captain's message about returning to seats and strapping in. As a result aisle remained clogged, children climbing over seats unattended. The chaotic scene was a safety hazard. Flight attendants spent much time in their jump seats curtained off while they talked and laughed. Ran out of food and drinks except warm water and orange juice. No power at seats, no seat screens and extremely limited entertainment options-sound on the music was scratchy and not tolerable. I rarely use American due to their poor ratings - I will not use them even if they were the last plane on earth !"
2459,"  Seattle to Buenos Aires via Dallas Ft Worth. I fly regularly to Argentina from the US. I purchase First Class tickets, typically in the region of $5-6000 USD for a return trip. I have to say that AA First Class is not a patch on other international carriers. My most recent trip, the hard product was okay, the seat was comfortable and that was about it. The AVOD system is old, slow, low resolution with a tiny screen. The choice of movies is very limited. Even bearing that in mind, this can be made up for in service. I found the flight crew to be indifferent, the service below average and the attitude seemed to be we were a constant inconvenience preventing them from being able to get back to the socializing at the front of the cabin. I am a very, very low maintenance flyer, but I found even the basics were missed. On the outbound leg, I wasn't even offered a drink at boarding! This is in International First Class. Food choices weren't available from the menu (I was in 2J) and I get the distinct impression that most people on the flight were on FF upgrades as opposed to paying pax. On the return flight, an AA employee (non flight crew) was sitting across from me - he was attentively taken care of, chatted to, given menus/drinks/turn down etc. The Airline is in trouble when it takes care of employees over premium passengers paying thousands of dollars for a seat. Aircraft is getting really old, this was a B777-200, and the interior was probably late 90's or early 2000's. Other than the large seats, everything was to a lower fit, finish and equipment level than an Alaska B737 in economy! There is not excuse for this, in fact, the AA A320 on the connecting flight to Seattle was way better with USB ports, power and a really nice big hi res AVOD system. Delta flies old airplanes too, but their interiors are bang up to date. There was not even a standard 110V power outlet - in First Class! It's hard to be a repeat customer, AA has been good in the past, but they are now firmly in the United Airlines category for me, they don't seem to be too bothered about earning my dollars. Take a leaf out of the Delta book or for that matter, BA or Air NZ."
2460,"Ronald Reagan to Sarasota–Bradenton with American Airlines. My checked bag was lost on a nonstop flight. After several days of hourly hassles on the phone I finally received my bag five days into my vacation. I was told to buy items I needed and submit original receipts, no problem! I spent considerable beach time shopping for necessities and tried to keep costs to a minimum. I submitted original receipts and then the fun began. I was told to fill out a form and resubmit receipts. I complied a second time. I wrote AA my third letter. Almost four months into this I received an email saying they couldn't go forward because they didn't have original receipts. No I don't have original receipts because I sent them to AA four months ago. They just want you to give up in frustration. I don't have any more patience to deal with this so I indeed give up. I will never fly AA again."
2461,"  Business trip from Albuquerque to Heathrow followed by a personal trip from Heathrow to Budapest with American Airlines. Coming back the same way. Flight from Albuquerque was delayed, missed my connection. Two-stop flight to Heathrow became three stops with an overall delay of about six hours. On the way back AA lost my booking from Dallas to ABQ. It took about one hour to re-book at Budapest, supposedly due to the incompatible systems AA and BA use. This is not my first bad experience with AA. I would have flown KLM or BA to Europe but due to some crazy government rule I had to book an a US carrier. So far no WI-FI on any of the flights (sitting at Heathrow hoping to catch my connection at Dallas). This is the 21st century. I will never fly AA if I can help it.
"
2462,"Barcelona to San Francisco via Madrid. Transatlantic sector was ok. Again, the food service, which was the main interaction with the crew, was poorly presented and unattractively arranged. I wish US flight crews would travel on foreign carriers from time to time just to see what style means when providing service. The Boeing 77=37-800 domestic leg was delayed and the FA was completely indifferent - rarely speaking and even fewer smiles. If the job is that much of a drudge, why not try something else. And again, the tray arrangement and meal presentation was of ""diner quality"". All of it was just so uninspired."
2463,San Francisco to Madrid via Miami with American Airlines. The seat on the Boeing 737-800 in First class was poorly suited to my body and the lack of a foot rest made it far less appealing. The meal was ok but the FA was absent except for the serving - no personal interaction outside of the basics. The flight from Miami to Madrid was okay but there was no panache or style in the service and the FAs again were careful to only do what was minimally expected. Made almost any foreign carrier exotic by comparison. I did like the Boeing 772 seat as it had multiple settings.
2464,"  Miami to Edinburgh via New York JFK. I will spare you all of the details of our first and last flight with American Airlines but will instead surmise. Arrive at Miami Intl after a fantastic vacation on a cruise and then at Four Seasons in Miami having travelled to Miami with BA. Check in at Miami. We had 3 bag to check one of which was 2kg overweight but the other 2 bags were significantly under. With any other airline no problem. With American Airlines a major problem which ended up with my wife and I having to open our bags in front of a line and carry a bag of dirty laundry for 14 hours Miami to NewYork on a very very old 767 with the smallest seats ever. Service on board dreadful. Interesting arrival at JFK with a ""go around"" on final? Now the worst - a transatlantic 7 hour flight on a 26 year old Boeing 757-200. Configured with 12 business class and the rest the lowest form of economy class we have ever experienced. Drinks service finally offered after 2.5 hours of the flight. The cabin team just were not interested. One of them during drinks service walked down the aisle with a large plastic bag of pretzel packets and literally threw them at us. They had a total of 6 cans of beer on the trolley? Food after 3.5 hours completely inedible and cold. The announcement of breakfast had everybody in fear. I have had far more legroom on numerous budget airlines on shorthaul. We were so pleased to leave this dreadful, dreadful airline. "
2465,"  I had the absolute worst experience out of the other 3 carriers I have flown before. American Airlines customer service is almost non existent and they just rip you off and not care. I had a connecting flight in Miami, FL that they scheduled for me, which boarding time was at 8:59 pm and departing time was 9:29 pm. My first flight to Miami landed on time at 9 pm, by the time I was actually off the plane (I pack very light and had one small backpack) it was about 9:07. I ran to my connecting flights gate to make sure I got there in time to check in and board to return home. When I approached the gate (at 9:15), the gate worker asked aloud if anyone was next and after I said that I was on the flight he responded very rudely ""too late, go rebook at the rebooking station"" and as he said that he printed out a boarding pass and handed it to a girl who was on stand by with her boy friend, also on stand by. So he basically did not want to undo what he had just done, which was give my seat away when I got there when I was supposed to be. The lady at the rebooking station then tried to charge me to rebook for something that was not my fault! I was stuck in Miami for over 12 hours, missed my shift at work and my classes. After contacting customer relations about the situation, they told me that it was my fault because I did not get to the gate to check in 30 minutes prior (which would have to have been 8:59 pm, when my first flight was landing).  Not only that, but not once did I hear them paging me over head to ""recheck"" or for their last call. After not getting a response back for weeks I decided to call again, the customer service rep then told me that the connecting flight that they had scheduled was in reality not a legal connection because it was set to depart less than 30 minutes after I arrived, that they cannot be less than 45 minutes. Which if that were the case, I would have gotten there in their ""30 minutes policy"" time frame.  After sending yet another email asking to be contacted by a superior by phone, I received another email saying that there is nothing they can do. They say they try their best to resolve any issues the best they can, but when they are at fault for something, cannot even admit it nor actually resolve the issue. "
2466,"  I am baffled at how unprofessional the entire American Airlines staff was at LAX. I was dropping off my parents at LAX We arrived at the airport around 10:30. We went in and used the check-in kiosk (but the kiosk said our confirmation number was incorrect) We decided to wait in line. Once we noticed that the kiosk assistance was free, my father asked for help but was surprised to receive a rude response from the staff member who rolled their eyes and proceeded to walk away. At that time we decided to continue to wait in line to speak with the check-in staff. My father even helped a single mother who was next in line who was clearly having difficulties with putting her luggage on the scale. We noticed that no one from the staff was helping her and seeing that she an infant strapped to the front he decided to step in. At this this point it was 10:50pm and we were getting anxious about missing our flight and going through security. So I took the initiative to walk up patiently to the desk. and was told final boarding was completed and that no other passengers were able to board. However after calling corporate head quarters, once we got home, we learn that final boarding time was actually 15 min prior to the flight time. The desk person told me to rush to ticketing to see if there was a connecting flight to get to our airport in Orlando. When we got to ticketing, we noticed that there were barely anyone in line, but the staff had no urgency or professionalism toward the waiting passengers/customers that needed help. There were only two customers in front of me. This is ridiculous in terms of manpower to customers, as there were 6 American Airlines staff members. I waited 15 minutes in line patiently. During this time, I saw an AA staff member who was easily identifiable. She just finished up with a customer. I waited a few minutes to wait for her to flag the next customer. She didn’t flag the next person (me), but instead was talking casually to the other staff members. So I walked up and waited to be addressed since she was talking. I did not say a single word or interrupt. She looked up at me and said in the most rude condescending disrespectful tone, that they weren’t ready. So I said back, “excuse me I didn’t even say anything to you”. Four other staff members who were free proceeded to talk and chat amongst each other. At this time, there were 7 parties behind us who needed assistance. I was finally helped around 11:10. "
2467,"  When we checked in, we only recieved our boarding passes from Honolulu to Dallas. Seat on the Boeing 767 was poor, I am a skinny person, and the seat and legroom was horrible for a 7 hour flight. The food was ok, I had a salad for 12 bucks. When we landed in Dallas, we tried to go to a kiosk in the airside, where you can print a boarding pass you didn't recieve at check-in, or so it said. We weren't able to print the boarding pass because American and US Airways were still in the process of merging, but both planes were painted in the American Airlines livery. When we went to the gate, luckily DFW Airport has the sky train, that's a plus, the gate agent refused to give us our boarding pass, so I had to show him the confirmation e-mail. We were the last passengers onboard, there was no overhead baggage space, so we had to go back to the gate agent to have our bags gate checked to Philly. Luckily, I slept throughout this entire flight. Landed in Philly, everything was ok, got our checked bags, and left. Never again will fly on American."
2468,"Salt Lake City to Knoxville via Chicago with American Airlines. Half way through boarding the first flight everyone was removed from the plane. It took the agent 25 minutes to tell the passengers any information as to what was going on. Mechanical problems. We sat for at least an hour before anything else was said. We were told to come to the counter and schedule another flight if we wanted. After standing in line for 45 min we were then handed a 1 800 number to call to reschedule. When I was near completed doing this they said the flight was canceled, we would have to go collect our luggage at the baggage claim, and go through the ticket counter to then get our new boarding passes. The 1800 agent had me scheduled, but it automatically canceled that one and scheduled me on another flight - 1 hour from then. I rushed to collect my bags and at the ticket counter the agent was not concerned about my troubles. The new schedule delayed my arrival by a day and I would have to stay in Chicago over night after arriving at 11 pm. When I asked she told me she didn't see where 'they' were giving any vouchers for food or overnight stay. Also, despite the long security line she wouldn't get me a 'prescreen' pass to get through security quicker. She said 'you have plenty of time.' Well, I did make it, with 3 minutes to spare. She was so right. I was routed through Dallas where I asked the agent there if I would be given a food and/or overnight voucher. She said I would have to check in Chicago, she couldn't help me. Upon arrival in Chicago the airport was almost empty except for a gate where they were about to load a plane. There were 4 agents standing at the counter talking (ie. doing nothing), so I asked one what I needed to do about staying in Chicago and is American Airlines going to give me a voucher. She said 'she was busy having to get ready to load a plane' and gave me another 1800 number to call or I could go down to the service center, which is a collection of phones, but no agents. I decided to consider it a complete loss. It was now almost midnight so I walked to the Airport Hilton, paid for a room, and left the next morning with yet another delay. Since then I have heard similar stories about American. I don't think I will be flying with them again. Customer service couldn't have been worse."
2469,"  My flight out was delayed 2 hours due to aircraft problems. They re-routed me which meant not having the 3 hour layover in Phoenix in which I planned to see my brother and his sons. I was not compensated in anyway. When I booked the flight I had to change it and pay $108 but when they mess up my flights there is no compensation. My business in LA concluded earlier than planned and I wanted to get back earlier, they refused to waive a change flight fee for me saying they cannot do it and they told me they do not permit standby either. I took pictures of the disgusting condition of the plane I flew back on - the seat back flaps were peeling away from the seats, it was desheviled and gross. None of the entertainment options or free snacks they boasted about in their in-flight magazine ever occurred. Their employees were the most unprofessional I have ever experienced they never addressed me professionally (ma'am) they were unapologetic and they were irritated at me for expecting to be serviced professionally. I'll never fly American again."
2470,"  Albuquerque to Tampa via Phoenix. I fly frequently and my experience with AA has been consistently awful. Most recently, an AA flight canceled due to a crew member not showing up. I was placed on another flight the following day that had additional layovers because that was ""all that was available."" I was not in my home city so the AA agents gave me a voucher for $150 for cab fair/hotel but when I tried to use it, I was told I needed to pay out of pocket and contact AA Customer relations to get reimbursed. There is no phone number for AA Customer Relations (apparently they do not have phones), only email. I never got an email response and was never reimbursed. And, as if that is not frustrating enough, because I was added late to the alternate flight, I was the last to board, we somehow ran out of overhead space (on two separate flights) and they had to check my small (18"" round) carry-on. I pleaded with the flight attendant to let me keep it because it had valuable/fragile gifts in it but she insisted and it broke. I will never fly AA again. Not just because their customer service is terrible, it is literally non-existent."
2471,"  Flew from Tucson to Phoenix with American Airlines. Anyone else feel like we are just dollar signs to these big companies. They cram us in these small seats to fit more of us in there. My flight was delayed, a connection that was supposed to be from Phoenix to Seattle. The reason for delay was ""maintenance"". The purpose of this trip was for me to make it to a meeting. No point now I suppose. Customer service could have made it better with an apology but instead he told me there is nothing that could be done. "
2472,"  I booked Economy Class but was actually given a Premium Economy seat without any issues by American Airlines, for this alone I say bravo to AA. This is real member benefit (I am One World Sapphire) and will bring me back to AA if there is a flight. This was not an upgrade due to a full flight, add to the fact that the flight was not full, it was a rather comfortable flight having paid an economy fare. The flight time is some 8 hrs and I arrived feeling refreshed. Completing the four segments CDG-NYC-EZE completely changed my misconception on AA and I shall be their customer if I fly EY."
2473,"  The return American Airlines flight from Buenos Aires to New York JFK was more comfortable than the outbound journey as it is a day flight rather than the time-saving overnight. Again I had a Premium Economy seat paying EY fare and it was quite comfortable, again I say thanks to AA for such member benefits. I think other One World partners should learn to do the same rather than pricing themselves out of the so-called Premium Economy class. Service was normal and efficient. Airport check-in and facilities and Club lounge at EZE are not as good as at NYC though."
2474,"The second segment of my extra longhaul flight with American Airlines from Paris CDG - New York JFK - Buenos Aires. Check in at JFK was a delight, as AA has a special area for elite member to check in. The check-in service was excellent and I was treated like a VIP. Good that they print benefits such as Priority Boarding on the boarding pass, rather than the passenger having to show a card at the gate. As with the last segment I was able to get a seat that some 'partner airlines' called Premium Economy at no cost. The flight is long and a bit tiring, but what more can I ask with a PE seat that offers good space at my price?"
2475,"  I had an extra long haul return flight between Paris and Buenos Aires and I booked on American Airlines via New York for fare advantage and a stopover in the Big Apple. When booking I had reservations as to the standard of service etc but all doubts proved to be misconceptions with regard to American service. From check in, as a One World Sapphire member, I was allowed to change seats to what other airlines called Premium Economy seats without further charge (AA do not operate a Premium E service but charge extra for these seats), great that as a One World Premium member I had this benefit. This is more than enough that in future I will opt to fly AA above my 'home airline' CX or BA that I fly with often. "
2476,"  Terrible round trip flight from Seattle to Atlanta with American Airlines. The seats do not recline back at all despite having a button that is supposed to allow you to do so and all the flight attendants tell you to put your seats in the upright position. The arm rests are so hard, if you are a taller than average person be prepared to have a very uncomfortable flight. You can't stretch your feet out, your knees touch the other person's seat, you will be sitting up straight for the whole flight. Make sure to dress warmly as they like to keep you frozen during the flight as popsicles are less likely to walk around the cabin. They nickel and dime you to the point that it would have been cheaper to go with the more expensive airlines. I have a global entry card which is usually good enough for TSA pre check in most airlines, but you have to pay for that ""convenience"". Want to check your bag? That will be $25. Two bags; $60. Want to pick your seat? $45+ depending on the seat. Want Internet? $6 for 30 minutes. Please note, I chose N/A for food and beverages and inflight entertainment since I didn't use these. They were available but I chose not to buy them. The 1 star for wifi connectivity is because the pricing was ridiculous. I will never fly this airlines again."
2477,"  First longhaul flight with American Airlines which I booked with BA under codeshare. I was disappointed to find that this particular Boeing 767 didn't have any seat back flight entertainment. Just an old and worn out cabin with original interior and seat, possibly that has not changed since it was put into service 20 years ago. The only entertainment was CRT screens in the middle aisles and a choice of music played in a loop from the arm rest, maybe this was acceptable 10 years ago but in 2016 you would expect the airline to provide a modern cabin. In fact the whole cabin was so old and tatty even those in first had to use tablets for entertainment, this is unacceptable when paying passengers expect some modernisation. For such a popular route from Chicago to London you would expect American Airlines to consider using a more modern aircraft, but no they obviously don't care what their customers might think of the airline. They can afford to buy dremaliners and 777's but don't bother updating their current fleet. The food was also pretty poor quality compared wo what I have been offered on BA in the past, but I don't expect fine dining on an economy ticket. The only positive were the nice cabin crew and flight crew, very friendly, nice to talk to and captain offered very useful information throughout the flight. In future I'll avoid this airline, certainly not worthy code sharing with BA."
2478,"  London Heathrow to Miami return with American Airlines on a B773 both ways, family of 4. Flights left pretty much on time and arrived on time. Check-in at LHR was a bit of a nightmare but not sure who was at fault for the huge queue. Flight experience was overall good, seats are fairly comfortable being economy class. Inflight entertainment is on demand and plenty of films, games, music to chose from. Food was fine and more than abundant. Also plenty of drinks offered and before we arrived in Miami an ice-cream and a snack. However when I fly I care most about the safety of an airline rather than fancy food. Crew was fairly friendly, especially on the LHR-MIA leg and mature. Check in staff in Miami was helpful and friendly as for whatever reason I was unable to complete my online check in (think because it was ticketed by Iberia). Overall a very good experience."
2479,"  New York to Edinburgh with American Airlines. Got to airport (JFK) about 4.5 hours before departure. Decided to use electronic login terminals as we only had cabin baggage. Process was relatively straightforward and two documents were printed, however they did not have seat numbers on them but had instructions to proceed to gate where seat numbers would be allocated. Went through security and straight to gate, needless to say, there was no-one there becasue it was so early. Eventually about 10 minutes before boarding was due to start, one member of staff turned up so I got straight to the desk before anyone else to ensure that my wife and I could sit together on the long flight. I was then told that the flight was overbooked and that I would have to wait. Eventually another member of ground staff came up to the desk about five minutes before boarding was due to start (very harassed). Thankfully my name was called and we were able to get seats, but they were offering people 800 dollars to take another flight. There were many disgruntled people complaining about lack of information. Once boarded, we then had to wait for about an hour as they couldn't get one of the engines started! Actual flight was OK, but seat was very uncomfortable (I thought airline seats were all the same). Cabin crew did all that was required of them, but very disappointed in the ground staff, but maybe that's just the AA way of doing things! USA is a great country and the people are lovely, but you are so let down by your airlines and airports. Think we'll stay in Europe next year"
2480,"  Chicago to Tokyo Narita with American Airlines. Surprisingly very pleasant experience with American, especially how many horrible stories you hear about US-based airlines. The aircraft was a relatively new Boeing 787, and the J class cabin was a spacious 1-2-1 layout in reverse herringbone. Went onboard and was greeted with warm nuts and welcome drink. There was an amenity kit by Cole Haan, but everything was made in China, even the lotions, which made the product simply feel very cheap and of poor quality. The seat is fully lie flat. It's somewhat comfortable, the only complaint is that when the person next to you moves, for some reason, you can feel it (and I suspect the other person can also feel when I move) The inflight entertainment system was very impressive. Not only was the screen very big, there was an flatscreen display to control the programme from the comfort of your seat. There is also an iPhone-sized control for manipulating your seat and adjusting it to any way you wish, very impressive technology! The meal service was good, and came very eloquently presented. The crew was friendly and welcoming. There was wifi service, but I did not try it as it was for a fee. Overall a good flight experience on American's new plane, would recommend it."
2481,"  My flight was a five-ish hour flight from Kona, Hawaii to Los Angeles. It was my first time flying with American Airlines. Throughout the flight, the service they offered was a round of drinks. No complimentary food nor even snacks was served for the five-hour flight. The plane was equipped with inflight entertainment system but they charge you for every single movie or TV programme, at a price similar as if you're watching a film in the cinema. I'll try to avoid taking AA in the future except for really short flights."
2482,"  Painful to fly with American Airlines. The first flight had maintenance problems and was delayed which made our connection tight. We arrived, ran to our connection, arrived 8 minutes before departure and they wouldn't board us. Their rule is to be 'sitting' in your seat 10 minutes before take off and the staff said we knew you were on a connecting flight that had arrived. We are now delayed 2 hours missing a business meeting. Small seats, cold employees, AA is the worst."
2483,"  I will never fly with American Airlines again after the fiasco I experienced 30 Mar. Due to leave Ontario, CA at 1005 am arriving PHX at 1114 am. When I checked in at 0800 flight was “on time.” Cleared security and proceeded to the departure gate. Around 0935 announcement made that flight was delayed and passengers with connecting flight prior to 1230 were to return to ticketing counter. My Atlanta connection was scheduled for 1236 so I stayed at the gate. A second announcement was made some time later and I realized there was no way I could make my connecting flight. There is no customer service available at the gate areas and I had to return to the ticketing counter which meant a second time through security. This certainly did not please me but I went back to the ticketing counter and stood in the line that provided ticket sales/customer service. During my 30 minute wait in line the clerk kept telling the customers they would be much quicker going to the other end of the counter. Finally, when the “other end of the counter” was free I moved over to it. The clerk told me she couldn’t help me and directed me back to the counter I had just moved from. I told her it was time American Airlines got their act together as “he” had just directed me to her counter for service. By then I was incensed but, moved back to the other line yet again. At no time did I hear any explanation for the two delays. By the time I got to the clerk I was not too receptive to her “resolutions.” She could reschedule me for the following day (I had already cleared my hotel and turned in my car); she could route me to Dallas/Ft Worth, Charlotte, Atlanta; she could route me to Dallas/Ft Worth, Atlanta. Both flights would get me to Atlanta around 1148 pm. I did ask about transferring to either Southwest or Delta but was told I could only transfer to “partner” airlines. If I wanted to go with another airline I would have to pay to do so. At that time I had no idea there was a bad storm impacting Dallas but I’m sure your staff were well aware of that fact. While not happy, I opted for the Dallas/Ft Worth, Atlanta flight. Went back through security for a second time and headed for the departure gate. Another announcement stated due to a bad storm in the Dallas area the flight was delayed. This delay meant I would miss the last shuttle from Atlanta. The coup de gras was my boarding passes were stamped for Group 4-----my seat numbers were 23A and 15C. I came to the conclusion that your clerk purposely placed me in the Group 4 boarding sequence to add a little more aggravation----retribution perhaps? I’m 78 years old and have traveled many, many times in the past 58 years both in the States and to other countries. The airlines have merged to the point that they now have a monopoly. Subsequently, they no longer have to be concerned about retaining their customers. They are making billions in profits with the fuel price as low as they are but you continue to gouge the customers at every point - $25 for early boarding, really? Who wants to sit on a plane any longer than they need to?  This is my second bad experience with American Airlines and it will be my last. I will certainly share my bad experiences with everyone I know that flies."
2484,"Economy class flights with American Airlines, Kansas City to New York JFK via Charlotte. Both legs had a clean aircraft (particularly impressed with the A319) with good cabin crew. Both flights on time. The seats were comfortable enough for the 2hr hops, and the Boeing 737 had wifi to pass the time. I don't fly AA very often but I would be happy to continue with them if this level of competence is consistent."
2485,"  Flew Miami to San Francisco. Service is well below normal standard, even in what they call First Class. On approachong American Airlines flagship check in at Miami I was told by female employee to go 'over there' where the economy check-in was. I continued and asked her why did she assume I was not entitled to check in there. She said she had to make sure not everyone try to check in there as it was for First class passengers only. Well, I was travelling First and I am a BA Gold Card holder (Emerald in Oneworld) so I was doubly entitled to check in there. Very off-putting for an employee to do this. Worse was to come. The so-called First class is anything but First class, apart from the seat which was comfortable. No welcome. Pre-departure drinks were not cleared. Moody flight attendants. No hand cream in toilets. No breakfast worth having (only two quiches, the one I had was very bland and soggy). No bread was offered, just sweet cookies. I deliberately did not eat anything in the lounge hoping for a good First class breakfast. If I had brought a McDonald's meal I would have been more satisfied. Entertainment was a table. In 21st century America? Why do we pay so much money to travel with them if they offer so little? American is a rip off. They claim they are changing. I dread to think what it was like before they allegedly changed and improved services. They charge a lot but deliver little. "
2486,"  A red-eye flight from Las Vegas to Philadelphia with American Airlines. Flight was fully booked. All overhead storage was full, well before half the plane boarded. Our boarding group wasn't even called yet before they announced storage was full. This did cause boarding to take a lot longer than normal, as many people had to back track to check their bag with the front desk. The front desk continuously announced you could check your bag for free at the desk, due to the storage shortage, but it appeared most who were boarding ignored this. We gladly took them up on it, and dropped off our bags at the desk, well before everyone else finally realized they had no choice. This at least let us board quicker as everyone was now crowding the front desk. Desk crew was friendly enough, I think they were getting a bit annoyed despite multiple announcements that there would be no storage, that people were generally ignoring their calls. We flew economy, so seats were as expected. I'm quite tall, as is my wife, so it can be a bit uncomfortable with the small leg room after an hour or two. Knees not in the seat, but, not enough room to move them at all. So, if you are in the plus 6 foot range, and with a bad knee, can be a bit annoying, but, we realize you get what you pay for. Crew were friendly and pleasant enough, flight was mostly quite as it was leaving Vegas at 11pm and landing in Philly at 6. Napped most of the way, when I could, so nothing really to report. Flight was generally smooth and we arrived earlier than scheduled, so that's always nice. I only had a glass of water during the flight, so can't really comment on food/drink service, too much. I believe the Wifi on this flight however did not work. Disembarking was only troubled by other passengers. A middle-aged man near the back of the plane decided, rather than wait for the rows to ahead to disembark, he would just start pushing his way out, which caused people to get chippy. Not really the airlines fault, though they did not intervene."
2487,"Kona to Portland via Phoenix, and as usual, American Airlines doesn't disappoint. Horrible customer service on the ground and in the air. Employees are rude, take their time and are very slow. The airline does not communicate with its customers at all if flights are changed, and in my opinion, are extremely incompetent. Flew from Kona to Phoenix expecting an hour layover to Portland and when we land, we find out it's been changed to 4 hours. Mind you, a 6 hour flight with a screaming 1 year old plus being dragged through a 45 min process just to check bags because computers froze and then employees almost tagged our bags with the wrong tags. Then to have a 4 hour layover that was not expected, just to fly another 3 hours - worst travel experience of my life. "
2488,"Miami to Boston with American Airlines. Just wanted to say that  flight attendants not to be so rude when asking passengers about the emergency exits/whether they are comfortable or not. I was extremely uncomfortable sitting by emergency exit because I rarely fly and I didn't know what it entails. I was about to ask if I could switch but the woman spoke to me as though I was a complete idiot. I only chose this seat because it was one of 2 seats available. It was pretty awful to be publicly embarrassed because I was unfamiliar with the procedure. When I nervously stuttered that I didn't know what it meant she said, ""You know it's a responsibility to sit here, right? Maybe you should have a look at the pamphlet and familiarize yourself."" She didn't offer me another seat, she disdainfully informed me that I would ""have to be moved if I couldn't assist."" The gentleman next to me took pity on me and explained. Why would they go around asking if we're ok with sitting here/if we have any questions if they don't care if we're ok with it and are unwilling to explain? I'm pretty angry and embarrassed and it was a pretty awful experience."
2489,"Dallas to Seattle. American Airlines don't provide any priority boarding with babies (we had twin babies). During the flight I was rather rudely sent back to my seat by two crew members. I just asked for some water for my two crying babies. The lights for seatbelts were off and this was not during landing or take-off. There were also no command from crew to remain seated. To the credit of another flight attendant, she kindly brought us the water two times. Big thanks to her! No display about travel info whatsoever; no info where we are currently and how long till the final destination. There was no general IFE display screen at all. On all four flights (all at different times of the day), there was no food. Only the drinks and light snacks were free."
2490,"  I experienced a lengthy delay going down to Quito via Miami, but this was nothing compared to the problems on the return leg of my trip. Coming back home, I arrived at the airport very early and noticed that no staff were there to give me a boarding pass. I decided to use a machine to check-in and I was concerned when my reservation was not found. Once the staff arrived, I was informed that my flight to Dallas was cancelled due to weather. I researched the weather conditions in Dallas and found out that there were indeed thunderstorms, but they were brief and many other flights were delayed (not cancelled). Since the delay was ""weather"" related, the airline did nothing to help (no food and no hotel) and they repeatedly lied to customers. They had me re-booked on flights that were two days later, but I fought hard (and spent hours) to get onto a LAN flight that got me home just one day late. The cancellation cost me a lot of time and money (for hotels, taxis, and food) and the staff and service on American was atrocious. I truly believe that airlines use weather as a loophole to cancel flights that have light loads (saving them money) without having to take responsibility! The only good thing about the cancellation was that I ended up getting to fly LAN Airlines to Miami. LAN provides more leg room, comfortable seats, delicious meals with wine, and their staff really seem to care about the passengers. American Airlines is a nasty behemoth of an airline and I recommend avoiding them (even if it means paying more for a competitor)."
2491,"My recent experience flying out of Oakland to Indianapolis via Phoenix has shown that American will stoop to incredible lows when trying to avoid FAA regulations regarding oversold flights. Our flight was oversold, and when they could not find enough people to take their vouchers, they announced a last minute delay. They didn’t follow any procedures for said delay. Their gate agents knew nothing and the flight information wasn’t updated until sometime after I had boarded. Once onboard, we were told the delay was due to a leaky coffee pot. I’m still at a loss as to what safety issues were at stake for this issue. The flight attendant wasn’t much better simply stating, ‘you wouldn’t water on the floor would you?’ Clearly there is a disconnect here, because missing a connecting flight over a little or even potentially a lot of water on the floor isn’t worth it, especially on a holiday weekend where my plans for the following day ended up completely ruined.  Myself and probably a dozen other people missed our connecting flights. In my case, I arrived at my gate just as my plane was pushing off. My destination wasn’t a hub, and the people managing this flight couldn’t wait five more minutes to allow myself and the other two passengers who arrived at the same time I did, the courtesy to board. The next flight was four hours later (on a red-eye), and for my inconvenience, I got a meal voucher that would only be able to pay for a fast food dinner. Running through Phoenix, my laptop bag managed to open up causing my laptop to fall out. My experience with AA customer service wasn’t much better. They don’t get back right away, and they refused to escalate this. To this day, I’m still trying to figure out how a leaky coffee pot presents any real safety issue worthy of grounding a flight, and customer service didn’t have a good reason for it either. I was offered a measly 10,000 bonus miles, worth nowhere near what the travel voucher I should have received for essentially being involuntarily bumped. That will get you (if you’re lucky) one third of a domestic ticket, and not at all worth the inconvenience that was forced on me and fellow passengers. At best, this was someone’s incompetence. At worst, this was an unethical way for an airline to save a few thousand dollars. If it has really come to something like this to make a few extra dollars, then perhaps it’s time for their customers to find an airline that respects them a bit more."
2492,"  Mexico City to Miami with American Airlines. Check in at the airport was chaotic, very inefficient. When the plane arrived after it was delayed I saw that it had new livery, I assumed it was a new plane - but to my surprise it was an old plane on the inside. Legroom was horrible you could barely move your legs. The only thing they offer is some complementary beverages, if you want anything to eat you have to pay for it. Entertainment system is horrible, the wifi only works on continental America as soon as you leave Florida you are left only with the TV shows of the general entertainment system."
2493,"Kauai to Salt Lake City with American Airlines was the worst flying experience I have had. The day before the flight they moved my wife and I to different seats on the plane, that weren't even close to each other. We had make our reservations 8 months ahead of time, I figured that flights can change last minute, and they must have overlooked this detail. I called them to make them aware of the problem. I sat on hold with them for over an hour, till the representative came back and said they couldn't do anything about it over the phone and I would have to go directly to the airport to fix the problem. But also assured me that there were plenty of seats left and not to worry. I didn't want to take a chance, so I went online to check in and paid an extra fee to upgrade our seat so that I could move them together. When we got to the airport, they had moved our seat again, and they were no longer together again. They told me the plane was full and they couldn't do anything about it. Nor would they refund the fee I paid earlier. I would of made more of a big deal about it, but there was a family of 5 with small children in front of me that they did this same thing to, with seats not near each other. Bottom line, if you don't mind getting separated from your travel group, and treated like your are just someone to fill a seat, then by all means book with American Airlines. I never will again!"
2494,"  New York JFK to Buenos Aires with American Airlines. New business class layout, significantly improved from the old angle flat seats. Rather unusual arrangement, with every other row facing backward, similar to BA except that the seats are at an angle, with full separation between middle row seats. Not much storage space, though. The crew however were unengaged bordering on rude, no interest shown to the passengers, mechanical, no smiles, one felt that they'd rather be anywhere else but on the plane. Food was quite a disappointment, as well, edible, but resembling canteen fare. IEE were a bright spot, screens large, sharp, HD, with tons of movies and variety of shows. Overall, a vast improvement from the old business class, but what makes a journey pleasant and enjoyable is the cabin crew, and once again America Airlines disappoints. Not sure if I'd choose AA if this weren't an award fare, paid with miles."
2495,"  Montego Bay to Barbados via Miami. Seat pitch of both flights was good for economy, however on the MIA-BGI flight, we were seated in the main cabin extra seats at the overwing exits - perfect! Great legroom and seats comfortable. Crew friendly and efficient and nothing too much bother. Food and snack available were a little disappointing as not much choice available, but beverages were available. They offered one beverage service on both sectors however drinks were served from the galley when asked for. I haven't flown American for some years, however would not hesitate in the future. Ground staff at all airports were very helpful.
"
2496,"First flight of the morning (6am) from Reno to New Orleans via Dallas. Plane was in the ternimal since the night before. When we arrived to check in the status was still on time. Just prior to boarding time the airline informed us that there was a problem with the plane & we would not be able to leave until 2pm. We were unable to get on any other flight due to the delay of notification. Then it turned into 7pm. We would miss any connecting flight and have to spend the night in the airport. No compensation for time, food or flight was offered or granted. Very poor custome service. I know why I haven't flown American and I will not fly with them again. I will be taking my business elsewhere. "
2497,"  Weather is not the fault of the airline. I was due to fly from London Heathrow to St Louisvia Dallas. We left five hours late on March 28th due to heavy winds and rain. When finally on the aircraft it was immaculate. Pre-flight drinks offered and the menu given out. Considering AA now only has eight seats in the 1st class compartment of the Boeing 777-300, the two cabin staff assigned were more than sufficient; friendly and polite despite the harried nature of the boarding. Lunch served after reaching cruising altitude, starter, soup, and salad were very good. I wasn't very happy with the main course, considering the delay I probably should have chosen something other than beef. The flight attendant saw that I hadn't eaten anything she offered me another which was delicious. The inflight entertainment was great with hundreds of choices. The intercontinental WiFi took some adjusting but eventually worked just fine. My connecting flight was delayed for about an hour due to a mechanical part which needed replacing. Again on the short flight to St. Louis the cabin crew was friendly and very helpful with pre-flight offered immediately. Drinks were served promptly at cruising altitude and seconds were offered with a smile. Aside from the weather delay, not a bad experience at all. AA #51 London to Dallas, can't remember the second flight number as it was changed so many times because of the weather delay. The staff at the Flagship lounge in London were helpful and caring and assured me that I would be re-booked which I was."
2498,"  We flew American Airlines AA207 from Milan to Miami. Air conditioning in row 20 to 25 did not work, it was that cold that people were complaining and asking for blankets which were not available. Even after many requests from different passengers nothing happened. When I asked the stewardess to send her supervisor nobody showed up. Cabin crew gave the impression to hate their customers. Headphones were of lowest quality. Entertainment program was the same to and back from Miama. "
2499,"I am an AAdvantage member and fly weekly for work. Without fail, there is always an issue on the American Airlines flight whether it's overbooked (happened on my last 3 flights), unpleasant flight attendants, ""running out of advertised food products"", delays, or like today, an hour delay because the gate was fixing another aircraft and were not proactive enough to identify another gate. Highly disappointing and frankly, uncomfortable."
2500,"  I am an AA Exec Platinum Member so I typically on the defense of American and I am loyal. That being said, I recently went on an around the world business journey that took me from NY to LA then Hong Kong, London and finally back to NY. The first and last leg were American Airlines the middle two legs were Cathay Pacific. While the AA planes were shiny and new and the business class was very comfortable, the level of service between the two carriers was night and day. It takes flying an airline like Cathay to realize just how much the service lacks at American. On Cathay I was personally greeted, asked if I required anything before takeover (and prior to landing), was given a large, clean, hot towel, had a very attentive flight crew that cared about my comfort and was always there to help and offer anything. On American Airlines I had a crew of people that clearly wanted to be anywhere else.  The warm towel was old and cold, the food was thrown at me as if it was a race to finish the meal service, when I asked for another water I was given the cold stare - the team just seemed mad and visibly demonstrated that they think their job sucks. I wish I could say this was a one-off, but I have noticed it more and more on my AA flights. Its sad and makes me not want to keep flying the 50-100K miles I fly each year on AA. Whatever happened to people having pride in their work? The last 6 AA flights I have been on have all had a problem of one sort or another - I notice the pilots having to apologize a lot. From a water hose freezing to the wing, to their being equipment in the way of our gate - something has definitely run amok at the new American."
2501,"I could have driven back and forth from Miami to Orlando before our American Airlines plane actually took off. When I asked an attendant at the airport, she told me and several other passengers that she's sick of people asking her questions, she does not get paid enough and then she walked off leaving several other employees looking at each other dumbfounded. Now, after waiting forever to finally board and having to change gates to another gate completely across the crowded Miami airport, we are sitting on the plane waiting for them to ""fix"" something on it. Worst airline ever."
2502,"American Airlines Flight 34 delayed from Los Angeles to New York JKFK  on 3/28/16. Every employee I came in contact with (approximately 15) was dismissive, irritable, irritated, and avoided eye contact except for one who mistook me for someone else she helped earlier. They had tasks they needed to do and all appeared unhappy to be representing AA. No one apologized for the delay or wanted to assist. Late updates from gate attendants. Finally we were instructed to present to Customer Service who told me ""I can't help you"" after helping the 4 people ahead of me and complaining over the radio that everyone was sent to Customer Service. After refusing to leave without assistance she offered me standby for the next flight. I was then shuffled around from gate to gate. All attendants saying, ""I have another flight to get to"" or ""We have to get ready for another flight, go to Customer Service"". I asked for a food voucher or some compensation and was instructed to go to another gate for food. When I arrived at that gate the attendant told me she didn't know what I was talking about and said to go find someone else. When I asked if she could radio to ask, she said, ""I'm busy"" without looking up during the interaction. Once I finally found the food, it was fruit, granola, yogurt, chips, and water or soda/juice. Nothing of substance. This airline continues to disappoint."
2503,"  There was a 13 hours stop over in Miami from around 9pm to 10am the next day but although they sold this as a flight to Mexico, American Airlines didn't provide night accomodation. For me it's more like I bought 1 flight to Miami and a flight to Mexico from Miami. My way back to Montreal, was the worst trip I ever experienced so far. First there was a problem at Mexico airport with American Airlines IT system so it took 3 or 4 hours to board on the plane to Charlotte. Then in the evening the flight from Charlotte to Montreal was cancelled due to a snow storm. From there American Airlines staff wouldn't make any announcement, they'd just let you die in the airport. Finally I got a flight to New-York La Guardia in a cold and ghostly airport where I spent the night waiting for the morning to catch some American Airlines staff. I would never use this airline again unless I have no choice!"
2504,"  All the poor reviews were supported by this Los Angeles to Las Vegas flight with American Airlines. The aircraft was drift, despite being relatively new. Staff could not care less about their appearance or the service they provided. I understand this is a short sector of just over an hour, but to call it 'service' to have a grotty basket with microscopic bags of crisps thrust into your face, is little more than a joke. Such a let down. At least we got there on time and they didn't lose my luggage."
2505,"New York to Curacao via Miami. I don't even know where to begin. I'm not usually a big review writer. On March 17, 2016 we embarked on a journey of a lifetime. My eldest daughter was to be married in Curacao, a destination wedding. After meticulous planning we arrived at JFK airport to find that our flight would be delayed. In that delay we learned we would miss our connector from Miami to Curacao. After being directed into three different lines, we were told nothing could be done and that we would not get connector flight out to Curacao via Miami till 1130 a.m. the next morning. (Almost 18 hours after our initial connecting time.) Crushed at the news of potentially missing the wedding, airline staff asked why we booked our connector like we did? As if it were our fault! Tears rolling down face I responded by asking ""why the offer a connection under 50 minutes if it can't be honored? Fast forward, we finally board our flight to Miami. Things seem to be going ok until we stay on the runway for 50 minutes. No explanation given. We finally take and arrive in Miami to find we cannot disembark because there is a broken plane in the way. Left with no patience and a $14 food voucher we schlep to our hotel. We missed many festivities that occurred during our delay that I can never recover. The unsympathetic staff that seems to be used to horror stories like mine, turned a deaf ear. Shame on you American Airlines! As a side note, my daughter the bride was on a different flight that day (still AA). They refused to hang her garner bag up, which contained her wedding dress! Flight attendant proceeded to roll the garment bag and shove into overhead compartment."
2506,"Horrible customer service. Flew from El Paso to Pensacola via Dallas. Initial flight was cancelled, originally heard due to an attendant becoming sick. Was re-booked on the latest possible connection. Called customer service to have it rectified, and booked on an earlier connection. Thought the transaction was made, but when it became boarding time, I was unable to be manifested due to some type of error within the system. Ended up arriving to my destination 6.5 hours later than originally planned. While this isn't huge in the grand scheme of things, I think as a paying customer I should be reimbursed with something other than an apology and hopes for continued business. Next time I'll look to pay a few bucks extra, and use a different airline. I will also look to avoid using this airline as much as possible."
2507,"American Airlines from Buenos Aires to San Francisco via Dallas. Having boarded had my overhead cabin bag moved to accommodate someone else, slightly annoyed me as I wasn't informed until another passenger told me. We had no inflight entertainment on our 11 hour flight. No apology. No lights to even read! No apology, no way of calling for the cabin crew as the call button did not work. When notified the staff were not concerned. Only one spirit drink allowed which is ridiculous. I've flown many airlines and this is totally unacceptable behaviour by this airline. I am a vegetarian and they didn't know that it was requested by me."
2508,"Worst airline ever. What should have been a 7 hour flight turned into a 20+ hour disaster. Bought first class ticket for my son from Miami to Portland, because it was a red eye and want him to have no issues. Flight left late, he was bumped 3 times from flights and offered no food, had nowhere to sleep. If this is the way American Airlines treats First Class customers, no one should ever book a flight on them ever again."
2509,"  Traveled with American Airlines as part of a code share with British Airways. Traveled outward with BA London to Miami and returned from Philadelphia to Manchester with AA. When travelling with scheduled airlines long haul the first service has always been a complementary drinks trolley providing a relaxing start to the flght. Not with American Airlines. The first service was the main meal with the accompanying offer of wine or beer. If spirits were requested there was a charge. We were sitting just behind seats with extra leg room and the next thing was a cabin steward coming to draw curtains around the area leaving us with no view. When asked what he was doing, he said it was an area for the cabin staff to sleep. The flight time was about 6.5 hours and the 2 staff spent over half of that time sleeping and watching TV. Nice work if you can get it. Must be great to work a shift where you get paid to sleep and watch TV. Not that the screen was worth watching. The entertainment options were the worst experienced on any major airline."
2510,"Washington DC to Charleston, and this is the 10th time I've made this flight with American Airlines, which I make 10-12 times a year, and is consistently horrible. The service is awful, the staff is unhelpful and beyond that a flight is never on time. If you can avoid using them without having to spend too much more money I'd highly recommend it."
2511,"American Airlines now typically holds back blocks of tickets so you cannot check-in online. No only that, when you actually manage to get tickets at the gate, many times you are separated from your family. I have seriously seen children as young as 4 being expected to sit by themselves. Rather than being the exception, this has become the rule. This is an obvious cash grab to try and get people to upgrade to more expensive seats to be able to pick their seats. Make no mistake they hold back seats for elite members that most 'normal' families will not see as options. When I expressed my displeasure at being separated from members of my party they told me I should not expect to have three people seated together. That is even though I bought the tickets months in advance. How is this acceptable? How would you feel if you went into a restaurant and was told you couldn't sit with the rest of your party even though you made your reservations months in advance. It's frankly immoral how they have no concern for families. You have a young child? Tough luck. Are you traveling with someone with disabilities or a person who has flight anxiety? Who cares? That's your problem chump."
2512,"Chicago to New Orleans in First class on March 16th. Flight boarded on time and friendly flight attendant greeting at the door. Flight 3/4 full and we left on time. Bumpy flight and attendants sat for a bit before pilot let them free to service the cabin. We were kept informed thru the flight of the weather as we had a lot of bumps. Lunch was served (we departed around 10:30am) so that was nice - a decent chicken-breast salad, cake and veggies. GOGO wifi worked well so was able to work. 2 hour flight was uneventful and landed on time. Bags took a bit long to get from gate-check but otherwise fine. "
2513,"Dallas Fort Worth to Costa Rica. They couldn't get data to take off, had to wait an hour, taxi back, then take off to hit the storm we should have missed. Missed our connecting flight. The flight attendants refused to serve us after the pilot gave them the go ahead after turbulence, didn't pick up trash, and stated they were out of food while other people on the plane, before and after received food. Once arriving in North Carolina we were booked for a 1 star hotel in the ghetto and given dinner vouchers that were unusable, as it was now 12 at night on a Sunday. Were re-booked the next day which is understandable, but on another connecting flight through Ohio. Tried to fly direct at the beginning and they were sold out 3 weeks in advance. Will never fly American Airlines again unless absolutely necessary. Worst flying experience I have had. "
2514,"New Orleans to New York via Washington. My flight from New Orleans was delayed because of American Airlines problem and because of that I missed my connecting flight, yet they did not provide any hotel and on top of that asked for $75 change fee. When I asked why flight was delayed one AA customer service told me because of weather, another told me air traffic control. American Airlines are simple cheats. Unless you are looking for a horrible experience do not travel American Airlines."
2515,"I traveled American Airlines from Toronto to LaGuardia. When I arrived at the check in counter there was a huge line with one representative working. By the time we got to the counter 1 more person opened up after waiting for 45 mins in line. When I reached the counter the representative told me I couldn't board my flight which was at 11.30 (1 hour still left). Mind you - there was no greeting or any sort of smile passed by. Instead was told you have to get on the next flight. Which was at 2 pm. I asked to check in my luggage and stroller now, and car seat when I came back so that I can go out and grab lunch. When I returned to check in my car seat my stroller had been misplaced. After a mess there I finally was able to board the plane with the stroller and car seat. However when I arrived at LaGuardia 30 mins late the Stroller and car seat were both missing. Again I wander everywhere because I was sent here and there. Not 1 appology was provided. The lady at the counter then processed my order and said it will be made a rush order. When American airline says rush order it means they show up at your door at 12.15 am when everyone is sleeping - to drop off only my car seat. As I type this I am still missing my stroller with no whereabouts of it. I request everyone to spend the extra money and fly with a better airline. While on the plane not a single glass of water was offered, however they walk around to collect garbage, you didn't give me anything to throw away? This is by far the worst airline I have traveled with. A 4 hour travel turned into a whole day of craziness."
2516,"American Airlines from Philadelphia to Montego Bay, Jamaica and service was terrible.  I paid for assigned seats and instead my whole family was scattered about the plane. They had a ten year old sitting by himself! The luggage cart just sat next to the plane without an attendant and we waited a half hour after we were supposed to take off.  Will never fly with them again."
2517,"I flew First Class on American Airlines from Cartagena to Miami and had a 5 hour layover before continuing to San Francisco. I was traveling with 2 other friends who were flying on to LAX. We proceeded to the Admiral's Lounge in Miami for our long wait. At the lounge check-in counter, I was denied access because the American employee said Miami does not have a reciprocal agreement with SFO. My friends who were flying to LAX were granted access because Miami and LAX have a reciprocal lounge agreement. My friends enter the lounge, I went back out to the public area. I was humiliated and appalled at the treatment I received. Then, I boarded an old plane with no entertainment, no full reclining seats and no privacy in the First Class section. I will do my best to never fly American again."
2518,Manchester to New York JFK with American Airlines and one of the worst flights of my life. Cabin crew on the way there were rude and we're taking it in turns to nap. Ran out of free beer before reaching us on the first round but the food was okay. For an 8 hour flight plus nearly 2 hours delay the seats are horrendously uncomfortable - an awful start to my holiday. I spent the 5 days in New York dreading the flight home. I was right to dread it - the same plane with awfully uncomfortable seats. The crew were much nicer. It was a night flight - no room to try and sleep as the seats are so close together. I will avoid AA like the plague.
2519,"Going from Buenos Aires to Iowa and back. I haven't flown American Airlines in years, but since they were the airline that flew into the Iowa city I needed to go to, I decided to try them again. Planes are very old, staff is ambivalent to rude, and my last leg I tried to get changed from online check in to at bag drop and each stop along the way. I wanted to head out 2 hours earlier from Miami since I didn't need to sit at the airport for 10 hours. They refused to move me even though there were seats and the flight I was on was overbooked. The flight I took was more than 2 hours late because they had to move a plane to get our plane out? As a side comment, when the gate changed they only announced it in Spanish. Not a good experience. Won't be coming back."
2520,"Four American Airlines flights during past two weeks London to Aruba via Miami, and Panama to London Heathrow via Dallas Ft Worth in Business class. On none of the flights I was welcomed onboard, neither heard a ""bye"" or ""thanks"" when leaving the aircraft. The best flight was the first, both regarding the seat, the food and the crew. The last flight was absolutely the worst. An old, worn Boeing 777 with terrible seats. Delayed 3 hours because they had to change a part after we already had boarded. The crew was quite miserable, not enough lavatories, the food was so so, the entertaiment choices very limited. Was happy to board a BA flight in London."
2521,"Booked an American Airlines flight from Austin to San Juan, Puerto Rico in mid January. Over the last two months, they have made 5 schedule changes without letting us know of the change. We have to constantly monitor our record to find the changes, and two have required us to rebook different flights in order to make connections. We are still two months out, so I am expecting another 5 changes before we depart. When we call to talk to a representative they are generally nice, but completely unhelpful. Two of them even took to reading me their operations manual as they tried to decide what to do. I am a frequent flyer with other airlines, and have never had a single schedule change. No wonder American has such a bad reputation. I will never fly American again."
2522,"When I booked my flight with American Airlines I was a little concerned because I had never flown with them before. My  trip was uneventful, which in my books is good. No delays, no issues with my bags, and no issues with the flight itself. Originally I was supposed to fly home on Saturday 12th March, but due to extreme flooding in North Louisiana, which is where I flew to, I will not be able to make it to the airport tomorrow. The airport I flew into is about 2 hours away from where I am at and the airport there was not in the extremely affected areas. At first I was told that unless I was flying out of one of the two cities that got hit the worst nothing could be done about my flight, even though the roads to get to the airport I was flying out of were blocked. I spoke to AA customer service and she was able to wave the fees and change my flight anyways, I am now a pleased customer and will be comfortable flying with them again. Now as far as the insurance I purchased for my flight, that's a different story. They did me no good at all!"
2523,"Just had a horrible experience - I had a red-eye American Airlines flight to Miami from LAX for an important meeting. The flight was supposed to leave at midnight, and was on a ""new"" plane, according to the captain. Before even taxiing, the airplane began to experience computer issues. Multiple attempts to fix this, including a reboot, rewiring, and many false starts all resulted in nothing. In the end, I got off the plane because there was no way I could make my meeting in Miami in time. The plane ended up taking off around 7:30 am  after a 7.5 hour delay. On top of that, American is taking up to 6-8 weeks (according to their timeline) to refund me the seat upgrade I paid for, didn't take accountability for this issue or suggest solutions, and didn't give any miles or more than a half-hearted apology by e-mail. I will actively avoid American Airlines in the future given what seems like a lack of commitment for customer service and operational excellence."
2524,"Our flight from Phoenix to Las Vegas with American Airlines was delayed for 30 minutes - we were in the air for about 15 minutes when it was announced that we must turn the plane around because it needed a new antenna. As we sat quietly on the ground, they eventually told us that the part they needed would be here by 2:00pm. The flight was suppose to leave PHX by 11:30am. As 2pm approached, they told us the mainentance wouldn't be here in time. They found another plane and had us head to that area of the airport. They told us to hurry over because the flight would board by 2:15 pm. 2:30 pm came around and we were still waiting to board and for a pilot to arrive. We boarded the plane at 2:45 pm. 3:10pm comes around and we still haven't moved. The flight attendant comes over the loud speaker and tells us there is another problem. We have now been on the plane for 4.5 hours and during this entire time, not one member of American Airlines staff has apologized for the inconvenience, nor comped anyone's troubles. We are now on the second airplane, while we wait for mainentance, a second time. I have never been on an airline in my life that was so disrespectful to their passengers. Excuse after excuse has occurred without any consideration for the passengers onboard. Think twice about booking a flight with them if you have to be anywhere important to be."
2525,"I booked my American Airlines flight online and they took the money out of my account immediately and then hours later emailed me saying ""the seats I selected were not available."" So I tried calling multiple times and after 45 minutes finally got a representitive and they told me my seat number would be given to me at the airport. I arrived and when I got through security and to my gate they denied me getting on the flight when I still had 10 minutes to departure. My father died and I was trying to get home ASAP. They told me they would put me on standby. After spending 5 hours at the airport I found out 5 people were in front of me for stand by. The people were rude and did not seem eager to help passengers. Will never in my life try to fly through American Airlines and will never recommend them. Also they said my ticket was non refundable."
2526,"First flight from Des Moines to Lihue they changed planes so the $75.00 extra I paid for exit seats and extra leg room seats were no longer - told me they would refund my money! Which doesn't help on a 7.5hr flight when someone got lucky and got exit row seat that's did not pay for them! Then checking in to fly home, the same problem - we were the 6th person to check in I asked they said they switched planes and we would not get our seats and everyone had checked in! Which was not true. So once again ""we are sorry you will be refunded I'm 2 to 3 billing cycles. So someone that did not pay for exit row seats gets our seats again. They just change seats with people who have not checked in!"
2527,"Boston to Aruba via Miami. Once again flew American Airlines and once again we had problems. What everyone else is saying about this airline is true. The plane used from Boston to Miami looked nice and new from the outside, but it's a whole different story on the inside. Inside the aircraft, the interior is horribly outdated and not clean at all. The plane smelled horrible the whole way. Worst of all, there is no in flight entertainment. Large TV monitors every few rows and the one closest to me wasn't even working! The seats are so uncomfortable and the leg room is virtually non-existent. Many of the seats show wear and tear. The flight attendants were rude and have miserable personalities and act like they are doing you a favor in serving you. The food was the worst I have had on an airline, especially on the return flight. I fly to the Caribbean every year and American Airlines is the worst airline I have travelled with. "
2528,"We sat by a large person and he was unable to fit in his seat without taking up 1/3 of the middle seat. There were a few open seats around us. Unsure why this large man was not given the extra room he clearly needed. There needs to be allowances for obese people. It is not reasonable to expect me to give up a third of my seat and not be able to move. This man was approx 5'9"" and weighed no less than 350#. Miserable American Airlines flight from Dallas to Denver."
2529,"My wife and I decided to treat ourselves and fly business class to see our son in Raleigh. American Airlines business experience was almost laughable on the return journey. The flight out was OK but not anywhere near as good as other airlines. The return journey was abysmal. From surly check in which even my son commented on,to an ancient aircraft and inedible food. We assumed from all the advertising about the newly refitted planes we would enjoy a comfy flight. I checked in online the day before and looked at the seat plan to make sure it was the new configuration which it was. On boarding what a disappointment to find an ancient plane with the old seats and shabby interior. We have experienced these old planes before and our hearts sank. So much for a treat. The stewardess was in such a rush to serve my wife she skipped the nuts and gave her her starter immediately, before she was ready, her plate was whipped away and her entre plonked in its place. We had to laugh because we felt we were in a carry on film. What is it with American Airlines staff? They need some training as something is missing, and their customer service is dire. Sadly they have a monopoly on the Raleigh route. We will consider going another route next time on British Airways who are so much better. One good thing, the plane landed on time. Wake up, American and sample what other airlines are doing. If you must use ancient planes let the customer know in advance to save the disappointment on boarding."
2530,"Our noon flight to Dallas from Austin seemed routine, the plane had just come from Dallas with no issues. But after backing away from the gate, the plane sat for what seemed like a long time with no explanation. Finally, Captain told everyone that the plane had a faulty ignition and would have to return to the gate for maintenance inspection. After telling everyone that repairs would take ""about a half hour"" he then came back and said delays would now be another hour. He let people unboard, which later resulted in further delays. By the time we took off we were two hours behind. Once again there was an unusually long delay between leaving the gate & getting off the ground. When we finally landed in Dallas, again another long delay getting to the gate. We missed our connecting flight by 5mins and had to wait 5 hrs from the next flight. We were bumped from row 14 to row 28. Never again will we fly American Airlines."
2531,"There is no doubt that American carriers in general lag behind their European, Middle Eastern and Asian counterparts in anything from service, equipment to entertainment. On my recent flight on American Airlines it came to a new low at least as far as entertainment is concerned. The available selection and more so the interface is not something I expected to see on a Boeing 777. The movie selection was minuscule, even compared to carriers such as United. The New release selection comprised a handful of features and most of them weren't even that new. The features are not ""on demand"" they have a cycle and you have to either watch what is in progress or wait for the next feature to start.  The food in general is mediocre but since my flight originated in London it is probably better than if I had started my trip in Miami. Generally speaking I find that the quality of food on US carriers is better coming out of Europe rather than arriving into."
2532,"Business class on the American Airlines 787 is an excellent product flying from Madrid to Dallas. Seat is very comfortable, food and wine were very good, AVOD selection and screen resolution made it easy to pass some time away. Cabin crew were available and friendly. Liked the stand up area around the bar. Would definitely recommend them."
2533,"Please don't ever lose an item on an American Airlines airplane. I realized after landing in Miami that I had dropped my phone on the plan (Flight 2059). I went to the AA information desk and they told me that the plane was on its way back Charlotte (which seemed like a very quick turn around and I highly doubt that AA is that efficient). I was told that I would be able to retrieve my phone at Charlotte Airport when I return. I did file a lost and found report with AA on their website and got a generated e-mail that stated I would have to contact the airport. A week later when I landed back in Charlotte I went straight to the AA counter in the baggage claim area. I explained about my phone and the first thing out of the girls mouth was that I would need to come back in the morning because her supervisor was not there. I told her that I lived 2 hours away and it was impossible to come back in the morning. She then proceeded to spend the next ten minutes going through the computer system and finally told me that she did not see a phone matching my description. I have called AA at Charlotte Airport and all you get is a recording stating to leave your information and IF the item is found they will call you back. There is no way of talking to a real person. Needless to say it has been almost two weeks and I have yet to hear anything.  If AA cannot even return a phone when given the exact information on where and when the phone was lost, I cannot imagine what they do with really expensive items that they retrieve from planes. Obviously they must make some money on these found items because I read after 90 days items are turned over to the City of Charlotte."
2534,"I flew from Los Angeles to Miami for vacation with American Airlines and this flight was a bad one. The plane was painted in the new livery, but don't let the new exterior deceive you. The interior of the plane was outdated, as the seats were very uncomfortable to sit in and looked like they were from the 1990s. The trays were difficult to fold back into place once you unfolded them, and some even had scratches and ink marks from over the years. The lavatories were showing their age and were disgusting. The only entertainment sources of entertainment you had were magazines, the window, and what you brought on the plane. They had TVs on the ceiling, but they only started playing a movie in the last hour or so of the flight. The cabin crew was the best part of the flight. They came around a few times with beverages and snacks, and they were dedicated to doing their job. There was barely any turbulence, which made the flight very smooth. The people on the ground were also nice, and boarding was organized. Overall, I would not recommend flying American Airlines."
2535,"Norfolk to Austin visa Charlotte with American Airlines. Our flight was cancelled with no explanation and we were re-routed 12 hours later. Although we had paid nearly $80 extra per person for the earlier flight, we arrived too late to pick up our rental car - had to pay $30 for a cab to hotel, lost 1.5 days of vacation and ended up running through Charlotte like lunatics to make a tight connection late evening. No room in overhead bins and they checked our luggage. We got to the hotel at 2AM after waiting for baggage claim and a taxi. I could have driven to Texas quicker than this. Woke up at 4am and arrived there 22 hours later. I have flown to China quicker than this - appalling."
2536,"I just returned home from an American Airlines flight and before I settled in at home I felt obligated to write a review. The Miami airport was the most miserable travel experience of my life. After spending a wekk at the wonderful W hotel, I was met with rude American Airline agents at every corner - from the bag check in, to security. Angry, rude, completely unprofessional. At bag check in we were met with 90 percent of the kiosks out of order. Then we were yelled at regarding proper protocol for checking bags as if guilty of something. Then without any direction to where our gate was we roamed the enormous airport without any guidance from our baggage check in. Upon arriving at the gate, the airline agent followed the airline consistency of rudeness reprimanding us for showing up only 20 minutes before the flight was departing, which was insane considering we still stood in line for 20 minutes to board the plane. Upon getting on the plane, I greeted the flight attentendant with ""how are you today"", only to be met with a deer in the headlights attitude of why was I even talking to her. Then to end this complete miserable experience, my luggage was lost. The luggage specialist told me the luggage was placed on the next flight rather than ours. We arrived at the airport 2 hours before out flight, I asked her why this had happened. Her response was I have no idea. I then asked if I would received some sort of credit for this inconvenience and my luggage being delivered within 5 days, which she said no we don't do that. The lack of professionalism at every corner was astonishing. I flew Jet blue recently and the flight was bumpy and they credited every passenger 50 dollars, they are a class act. American Airlines seems to have been reduced to a modern Peoples Express. I am sure the CEO gets a handsome salary, but frankly is not doing their job with having such chaos and poor customer service exist at every level through a passengers experience. Horrible experience which could have been easily avoided with some proper management in place, customer satisfaction protocol in place for errors made by the airline, rather than treating customers like cattle with complete disregard for a pleasant experience. Management of this company should be ashamed. People's airline reincarnate, shameful."
2537,Terrible experience from Boston to New Orleans with American Airlines. Baggage fees. Have to pay extra to have my family sit together. Boston check-in staff not very helpful. I have a American Airlines credit card that gives me free check bags but because of a problem in the American Airlines system it cost me $150 dollars. The only shining light in whole experience was how helpful the staff at check-in was in New Orleans.
2538,"Philadelphia to Munich in American Airlines business class. The seat is pretty decent and easy access to the aisle in a 1-2-1 configuration. Upon ordering dinner I asked the flight attendant (who was the cabin services director / purser) whether a specific dish (blackened salmon) was to be expected as being very spicy or hot. The answer given was ""I have absolutely no idea"". Maybe I am used to more detail oriented cabin crew from european and middle eastern airlines however I would expect some knowledge about the menu in a premium cabin."
2539,"American Airlines is the worst airline, in both equipment and customer service. Their crew makes you feel like they are doing you a favor even though you are paying good money. My entire flight from Miami to Barcelona the entertainment did not work. I did not receive a single apology and when I mentioned it several times to the flight attendant they simply said Oh well. They did not offer another seat or anything to make a difference.  If you can avoid this airline I would highly encourage it. If you have to pay a couple of hundred dollars more, do it. "
2540,"Orlando to Des Moines with American Airlines and not a single redeeming quality. 2 cancelled flights in 2 days and they wouldn't do a thing. I had to rebook my own flight over the phone. The airline staff have to be the least friendly, least helpful of any airline I've ever flown."
2541,Philadelphia to Washington with American Airlines. Worst service ever! They cancelled our flight and could not put us on another flight for two days. Then I had to wait 2 hours for my luggage to be taken off a plane that I wasn't even on! I would not recommend this airline to anyone. Their customer service was very rude and not helpful. We finally gave up and decided to drive 10 hours to our destination because they couldn't do anything for us.
2542,"Our outbound American Airlines flight to Indianapolis was fine, except for a rude flight attendant. Our way back was a disaster. Our flight from Indianapolis to Chicago was cancelled but this was told with zero kindness or empathy, but they told us we will go through Charlotte instead of Chicago to get back to Europe, all taken care of without asking the passenger at all. We refused and chose to drive to Chicago instead. The ground service at Indy was rude, nonchalant and not helpful at all, first they put us back on Economy class between ORD-LHR and afterwards they said there was overbooking on Business Class so there was no seat guaranteed. From Chicago everything was fine, we could not complain. The cherry on top of the cake was that the Charlotte to London flight they wanted us to take was also cancelled and never made it to London, so if we listened to the airline, we would have been stuck in the US for at least another day. The biggest problem was the ground service, where the customer is a pain in the butt."
2543,"New York to Miami. This was an okay flight compared to the other American Airlines experiences I had. No delay, flight attendants were nice, the IFE was for money though, but that is a minor inconvenience. The aircraft was a newer Airbus, so not one of those ancient planes American Airlines has these days."
2544,"JFK to Los Angeles return, out in first, back in business. Both products are outstanding. The F seats are spacious and private and the lie flat business seats are just fine. Both flights left on time and arrived early. Boarding is easy; priority for premium classes is well managed and the planes fit only about 100 people anyway. Service was attentive both ways and in First French champagne is back - a nice surprise. There isn't much difference between F and C catering (except for the champagne) and the meals are not exactly culinary experiences. But they are tasty and perfectly edible."
2545,"American Airlines 1517 from Miami to Roatan 02/13/16 was unable to land in Roatan and diverted to Belize.The Captain made the appropriate call as the diversion was weather related. Upon landing the Captain said they had a warning light on an engine that needed to be addressed. This was a clear mechanical delay. After more than an hour we had not been fed and later we were given a sandwich and bottled water and boarded . We taxied for takeoff where we sat for a period of time and captain reported the engine light had again appeared so we taxied back to the gate and sat until the 2nd mechanical problem had been resolved. The Captain told us that wet could not reach Roatan as the airport curfew for landing was past and we were flying back to Miami. We were told AA Customer Service would meet us and make the necessary arrangements for the night and the return flight the next morning. When we finished going through Immigration and Customs and baggage and we had GREAT difficulty finding the ONE AA Customer Service person who was extremely difficult to deal with in terms of the arrangements for the night and next morning. We learned that there were no hotel rooms available. He gave us a voucher for the 9AM flight the next morning, a $12 voucher for dinner @ 11.45 pm and we learned from other passengers that we were to go to the 4th floor to an auditorium. Upon arriving there we were provided with a folding cot, a blanket that was too small to cover anyone over 5'8” tall, the room was no more than 65 degrees and filled with people on cell phones, very tired and crying children, and chain saw snorers through the night. Upon checking in the next morning after an extremely uncomfortable night the counter people had no idea who we were and why we needed re-ticketing. Upon landing in Roatan, I learned a piece of my luggage was still in Miami It was necessary for me to go to the airport to pick it up. AA Customer Service in Roatan does not appear to exist, at least not for us! We learned that those waiting for our plane to arrive for their return to Miami had been returned to hotel rooms and provided with dinner and breakfast at no expense! AA should compensate every passenger on our flight and a written personal apology. I will consider any other alternative to using AA in the future."
2546,"The flight from Santiago to JFK operated by LAN Airlines was punctual with good service. We arrived at JFK at 9:00am and had to wait till 3:20pm for our connecting American Airlines flight back to Toronto. We were at the gate most of the time (except lunch), but only found out the American Airlines flight was cancelled when I checked the departure flight monitor around 1:45pm (no announcement heard). The lady at the gate only gave us 2 options going home - she would re-book us for next day flight but we would have to come back next day(or call-in) to confirm the flight; or she could re-book us with the United flights from Newark to Boston, then to Toronto. She also ensured us that we had plenty of time to travel from JFK to Newark via the Shuttle service(only 40 mins.). As it turned out, we had to take a taxi and it took us more than 1.5 hrs to travel and we missed the flights as the American Airlines lady booked. Clearly, American Airlines only cared about how to operate their flights, but not taking care of their passengers. They seemed to relegate responsibilities to other airlines whenever they can and forget about the whole situation."
2547,"I flew with American Airlines to Tampa, Florida from Manchester. The flight arrived delayed from Philadelphia due to departing traffic so we had a delay. We boarded with a friendly greeting from the staff. The flight departed, and excellent food and beverage service was provided. The Inflight Entertainment system was a very good one in my opinion. We landed on time in Philadelphia with a very brief connection. We got onto the next flight with very friendly Ground Staff, on time departure. There was sufficient service for the short two hour flight, drinks and snacks. No In-Flight entertainment but a very bad WiFi connectivity, if you tried to use the free edition. We landed on time in Tampa but had baggage issues due to weather, where the bags couldn't get off due to lightning. The staff kept us updated though and were very helpful. After 3 hours from arrival, we left the airport. Amazing service from American Airlines. Want to fly again."
2548,"In the past, American Airlines has been fine. After this last experience from Jacksonville NC to Milwaukee WI, with a layover in Charlotte NC, I will not fly with them. I've noticed a decline in the flight attendants service standards. They aren't as friendly, and seem to not be happy. My last experience on February 16 / 17 was terrible. An hour or so before my first flight, I received an automated voice message telling me my flight was delayed and that I'd miss my connecting flight, which was rescheduled until the next morning. When I got to Charlotte that night, the staff were not helpful in the least. They said ""all our hotels are booked. If you choose to get a hotel, you can send in a copy of your receipt to get up to $75 off"" It was a nightmare - I was all alone and ended up sleeping on the airport floor. I don't know what the issue was (weather? mechanical?), and it seemed like many people were in my same situation. However, the staff just didn't care and were very dismissive. I'm disappointed in American Airlines for not communicating with me what my options were (this hasn't happened to me before), and I'm disappointed in the careless Charlotte airport staff. I've never been so exhausted in my life after gettinG 3hrs of sleep on a cold floor and then waiting hours for my flight, which was again delayed by 30 mins. While I understand things like delays happen when flying, I did not feel like American was eager to communicate or help me."
2549,"Shanghai to Los Angeles. Had difficulties with American Airline online booking management as it does not allow changes or upgrade by cash through internet, which is kind of lame as most of other airlines allow that. The online seat selecting is not helpful as it was impossible for me to select three seats in a row due to American Airlines money-making seating regulations. Fortunately staff at PVG was very understanding and helpful and as we arrived quite early, and he arranged D,E,H for my parents and I. Aircraft was new and I liked it. Took off on time and the inflight entertainment more than enough, but maybe not so enough for non-English speakers such as my parents. Food was ok and flight attendants doing their jobs. All in all quite nice experience comparing to our next two domestic flights between LAX and SLC."
2550,"I was able to access OneWorld Emerald member benefits on this trip through British Airways. Check-in was prompt, followed-by time at the Admiral's Club Lounge in Terminal C prior to boarding. A321 was newly-painted in AA colors, and immaculate inside though seven years old. The cabin was quite spacious, and didn't seem cramped despite being a full flight. I did not miss the lack of AV monitors, though I like to see the flight path images on my trips. Two complimentary beverage service runs up to PHX, and snacks/breakfast food was available for sale o board. Service on board was efficient and adequate, with pleasant staff. The same aircraft continued to PDX after a one-hour stop in PHX, with a complimentary beverage and snacks for sale run. Flight attendants did several rounds to check seat belts, and also to collect trash on both segments. Arrived on time in PDX and my bag was on the carousel reasonably quickly. Overall, I was very satisfied with this flight and the fare paid."
2551,"I wasn't expecting much as all American Airlines are generally the pits but I was pleasantly surprised with the new American Airlines A321 service running between Los Angeles and Honolulu. Nice big TV screens with free movies, good width seats with plenty of legroom, food whilst not free was actually quite tasty, the asian chicken wrap was really good. Well done to American, certainly a move in the right direction."
2552,"I understand that sometimes flights get delayed or cancelled, it happens. What I do not understand is how a flight can get cancelled the night prior and I do not get notified, I still show up to the airport at 04.30 in the morning only to be told I got rescheduled to the following day at 11.30 am? I was scheduled to depart from Fayetteville, NC with American Airlines - I asked the lady working at the front ticket counter if there were possibly any flights I could make out of Raleigh, which is an hour away. She pretended to look then said there was absolutely nothing and I was stuck with the next day flight. A little while after leaving I decided to call customer service just to be sure, as it turns out there was a flight at 07.30 from Raleigh that I could have made it on to, and been able to make it back home for my college courses. Along with that there were also about 6 other flights available that day out of Raleigh. Even though the lady on the phone wasn't friendly at least she was patient and helpful. Sadly this isn't the end of my story, I ended up having a connection flight home, of course my first flight out of Raleigh was delayed so I had to run to the next gate. The lady at the gate was rude about me being the last one to board, which was due to my delayed flight with this company."
2553,"Barely professional and calmly arrogant. Both outbound and inbound flights with American Airlines were problematic to put it discretely. Outbound from Albuquerque (ABQ) to LA we waited on the tarmac for nearly an hour for what was explained as ""too much weight"". This enlarged into needing to correct the paperwork for this weight problem and finally into having to burn off fuel to eliminate the extra weight. Overall confusing and seeming disorganized in the first place. Our last leg through Phoenix to ABQ was a true mess. We came in on an overnight flight from Honolulu with a connecting flight leaving at app. 9am for Abq. However, we were held in Phoenix until 2pm due to ""mechanical problems"" with our assigned plane. This plane was still in Austin, (or so the gate staff said but the Customer service staff office nearby said it had departed earlier). As we sat and waited one could hear constant AA gate changes followed by a rush of passengers to elsewhere. The question steaming through our passenger group was simply, is there not another aircraft available when such a thing happens? Will we need to hustle to squeeze on to the next scheduled fight to Abq? Shall we rent a car and drive? The stressed gate staff kept announcing new and later departure times with no other info available. Then suddenly (our) plane arrived and after waiting briefly for a co pilot we left app. 5 hours late. The impression left was one of being in a gritty country called AA where chaos, lack of information and customer service is casually routine and where shareholders and yet greater profits are really the primary goal. We will try to avoid this carrier in future if at all possible."
2554,"Not flown American Airlines before and it will be my one and only time. Flight from JFK to Heathrow was absolutely disgraceful - tatty, dirty lounge. You get a ""voucher"" for a drink in the lounge but the food you could buy looked terrible. Really shocked. The cabin in business was really good, quite new. Cabin crew in my section were more interested in talking and checking their phones than looking even vaguely interested. The food on the plane was the worst I have ever had in business. You wonder how they think they can get away with it."
2555,"Traveling with my husband from Greenville-Spartanburg to Philadelphia. We paid extra for exit row seats. When checking in we found out that one of our seats was given away to someone who was obese and couldn't fit into a regular seat. They didn't offer to refund the extra money we paid and told us that we would have to file a report on their website to try to get our refund. Now we have to sit apart and I can't even sit in my seat comfortably because the man next to me takes up half of my seat too. Not one person from the airline has even apologized to us. Then after loading the plane we find out that there is technical problems with the plane and we returned to the terminal. (For some fresh air and room to move) Again not one apology from the AA employees. It's like they are so used to this that they are immune to the anger that passengers have. They don't show any concern. Not even a smile to ease the pain. Just blank faces doing what they are used to doing, nothing."
2556,"Boston to Las Vegas via Charlotte. I have been flying with American Airlines for a long time and I have seen progressive decline in customer service, quality of flights, and all around appearance of this airline. AA employees do not seem to care and it shows! After arriving at the airport where a airline representative directs you to wait in a line to check your bags (which they charge a fee for) and does not move due to lack of personnel. And when you approach a desk AA rep and telling her that you have been waiting on that line for an 1:15 and the flight is boarding, she says everyone has problems and please wait in line. I did and evidently missed my flight. AA doesn't seem to care for their passengers, and this is not my first unpleasant experience! With ever increasing fees for traveling and fees for checking bags and awful services that this airline offers, at a time that the airline cannot blame the price increase for high fuel, they are still not offering any service in return."
2557,"London to Miami and back on American Airlines was a pleasant experience. Very spacious full-flat seat, good entertainment system with plenty of options, a large high resolution screen and excellent headphones. Even the quality and quantity of the food was as good as on European airlines. Friendly crew, lacking a bit in sophistication. On the return flight, we waited on the tarmac for a full hour before we could disembark which caused a missed connection for me, but the airline cannot be blamed for that. The price was much lower than Lufthansa and the product was at least as good so I would fly American again."
2558,"Memphis to Charlotte with American Airlines. The scanners were broken leaving them to enter each seat in manually. The crew was rude one even ran onto the plane to pull someone off because he miswrote the seat into the computer. The plane from Memphis to Charlotte was 40 minutes late and went to the wrong gate, giving myself and other passengers 15 minutes to get off the plane and run across the airport to the opposite side, only to miss my flight. Though the plane was still there, since it was less than 10 minutes, the doors were shut and that was that. The attendants at the gate were rude and cut me off midsentence. I will never fly with them again. "
2559,"Dallas to Barcelona via Miami. I wonder how many times American Airlines are told that they are literally the worst airline? The service is atrocious and they simply don't care.  I'm writing this as we sit on the tarmac because of a lavatory failure. My entertainment system has been rebooted several times and I was simply told ""Oh well"" by the flight attendant. Just a blank stare like it is my fault.  Save yourself the grief."
2560,"Washington to San José. I made a mistake booking my AA Ticket online. Luckily the DOT requires airlines to allow you to make changes (with no fee) for up to 24 hours after booking a flight. I realized my mistake and called a mere 10 minutes after my original booking and informed the airline of the mistake and asked to change to the correct flight. The correct flight was the same price so it was a simple change. All went well and they agreed to change it no problems. (I thought) the correct flight was booked, and all was well. As I prepared for my trip, I realized my itinerary on aa.com was still the original flight. I call AA and they informed me that although they can see I called in, they have no record of the change. I explained that the reason I called (obviously) was to correct the itinerary, but they must not have done so. Despite the fact that they could see I called - they still wouldn't change my flight without the $200 change fee, since the operator apparently didn't annotate in the notes why I called, or change the flight correctly. Since all I have is a call log, and not a recording of the call, not sure how I would prove it.  I'm not upset they made a mistake fixing my mistake (I made a mistake too after all) - what upsets me is that they are so insistent on charging that $200 change fee - even after I can show them that the itinerary should've been fixed when I called them the first time! Not an experience I'll forget anytime soon."
2561,"East Texas to Myrtle Beach. Flight was delayed. We had 10 minutes to get to our next connection. The agent told us our flight had already left. My traveling companion had to work the next day at 8. The next available flight was the next day at 130p. American's next and final option was to offer a hotel at a distress rate. They did not solve our problem. I had to rent a car and drive myself to my final destination in order to be on time. Submitted a complaint on aa.com. Got an automated response stating they were not liable for my missed flight or the delay. A refund for the flight may be available in 4 to 6 weeks, but not for the rental car. This airline should not offer connections that are not possible to make. It was impossible for me to travel through two terminals in 10 minutes to catch my flight. Their representative showed no empathy and was acting like I was the reason my connection was missed. Someone really needs to investigate how often passengers miss flights and have to rent a car to reach their destination due to American Airlines insubordination."
2562,"I've flown dozens of domestic flights with American Airlines, and generally find the experience to be somewhere between tolerable and very good. This route, the service was quite good. I had the same crew on both the AUS-DFW and DFW-ORD legs, and they were quite pleasant and even recognized that I was on both of their flights. Despite the very short duration of the Austin to Dallas flight, they attempted to serve everyone onboard the drink of their choice (not just water), which was quite impressive. I appreciated the effort and polite service of the crew. My only criticism was the plane - American Airlines MD80's are very old, and it shows. No power outlets, out of date looking fixtures, etc. I was a bit surprised they would choose to use this plane on the relatively lengthy DFW-ORD flight."
2563,"Chicago to London with American Airlines. Comfortable flight on a refurbished Boeing 767. No in-seat video is provided but there are control boxes on the floor. Food and wine were fine. Crew were good and interacted with passengers during the flight. Overall, good basic service that gets you from A to B."
2564,"Las Vegas to Dallas. Mechanical problems are a given in the airline business however it's up to the airline to make up the difference. We missed our connecting flight and then waited for 1.5 hours for the hotel to send a shuttle. The airline had two hours to figure out who would be missing what flight and to coordinate effectively with the hotel for a seamless transition. Instead we waited in the cold and ended up at a hotel that was 20 mins away from the hotel, one that only had a shuttle once an hour and we almost missed the kitchen due to their laziness and poor planning. If it's ever in my power American Airlines will never get a dime from me again."
2565,"Montevideo to London via Boston. Check-in MVD with no troubles, informed bag need to be collected with clearing custom in MIA. Boarding the flight 2A comes to my attention there is customer occupying the seat however due to aircraft change seat 2A was free. Due to that change other customer was yelling at me to change seat.  Later during flight when crew gave custom form I wasn't too advanced in Spanish so decided to go to front galley and ask cabin crew to provide me with English custom card - that was mistake as five crew members laugh at me saying ""you don't speak Spanish"". Diverted from MIA to TPA due to weather (sure this happened, I managed to have a little snooze being on the ground 4h-5h with not much information). Tried to change my flight over the phone to attend my meeting in BOS however no chance to arrange it. After long morning and early afternoon having already few changes on my ticket I was sent to MIA by the same flight and arrived over 10hrs late. Crew on TPA-MIA flight was very good and that was only great team I witnessed during five flights on my trip. No one was able to assist me with changes for next day and I was offered another change and fly MIA to LHR. Being so exhausted with so little informations and if there were any confusing so badly I accept the change. When I boarded B777 some customers were approaching cabin crew asking about aircraft change and no flat beds available - crew denied any changes. When I contacted customer service to find some explanations and gave feedback from my experience I couldn't be any more disappointed from response. "
2566,"Charlotte to Los Angeles with American Airlines. I have flown on a lot of airlines, today's was the worst. Dismal customer service, rude counter workers and flight attendants, service boasted of wifi, television screens with 250 movies on the seat as well as USB chargers for the seats, none of which were available on a 5.5 hour flight. Boarding process was painful. Plane was dirty and some seats were worn out and had tears in them. Will not be flying with American Airlines again. Plane tickets are way too expensive for such substandard value."
2567,"London to New York JFK, returning from Miami, and great flights with in Business Class on Boeing 777-300. The space, comfort, and privacy on this aircraft is second to none. The cabin crew were courteous and helpful (most of my flights with AA have been in coach where the rudeness of the staff used to be legendary). On both flights, the FA greeted by name, confirmed my meal order with me (requested on line) and took my coat. Outbound lunch was good, as were the wines. Drinks constantly replenished. A selection of snacks was laid out in the bar between meals, although I didn’t try them. The pre-landing snack was croque monsieur, which was ok but really no better than the pizza that you used to get in coach many years ago. Before landing, the purser walked through the cabin thanking each passenger for flying AA. A nice touch. Bose noise cancelling headphones are superb, although they collect them almost an hour before landing. On the return from MIA, the food and service were again very good. The steak on flights starting the in the US is always better than on those starting in the UK, and it was served on a very hot plate. The salad was excellent. FA asked if I wanted to be woken for breakfast. Although I didn’t I was awake when breakfast came round and it was surprisingly good. I’d previously flown Business Class on the US Airways A330. The 777-300 seat is similar but improved. There is no gap between the seat and the wall, where things can be lost on the A330. There is a vanity mirror in the storage cupboard. The TV screens are larger (15”). The seats have more adjustable positions. However, there is no storage under the footrest. A nice lightweight duvet and large fluffy pillow added to the comfort. The seats are a bit hard when sitting fully upright or fully flat for any length of time, but are very comfortable when reclined. Sleeping on the way back, the plane was very warm and I slept on top of the duvet which was very comfortable indeed. The washrooms on this plane are very nice, particularly the one on the starboard size which is double sized. The equipment makes this Boeing 777-300 the best business class across the Atlantic, and the service was up to par. The downside of this plane is that all the seats are very private, and if you are travelling with a companion then even in the middle pair you can’t really see or talk to each other. If you want to socialise with a travelling companion, you may not like this plane.  IFE was fair, not a lot of new films but enough newish and classics to keep me happy. I've marked down ground service because of a problem at LHR. I am gay and was travelling with my partner. The check in operative at tried to make us check in separately. When I asked if married couples had to check in separately she said no. I explained that my travelling companion was my Civil Partner, and that we had the same legal rights as a married couple. She was embarrassed and apologetic, but making assumptions about peoples sexuality is inappropriate. Business class check in and fast track security at LHR are excellent."
2568,"New York JFK to Miami was on a refurbished American Airlines Boeing 767 with international business class flat bed seating. The seating is not as good as on the 777-300, but it’s a big improvement on the angled seating on the 777-200, and for a short domestic flight it is exceptional. The 1-2-1 configuration means every seat is accessible from an aisle, and the centre pairs are good for couples travelling together. All seats are forward facing. Service was friendly and rather informal. The food was good – the steak was better than on the flight over from London. IFE is only provided when these planes are flying internationally, and is provided by Samsung tablets in business class. Having flown into JFK in International Business Class, we had access to the Admiral's Club Lounge. These lounges are poor compared to British Airways. We got vouchers for two premium drinks each, but you have to wait to be served by a lone overstaffed barman, and the choice of food is poor."
2569,"I hope it was the last time with American Airlines! I had to fly both ways to Philadelphia and back to Germany with American although on my flight list it said I would fly with Iberia and British Airways. Maybe I had really bad luck but on both flights there were mayor problems concerning delay. Before the first flight we were told, the aircraft is going to stop halfway to refuel so we would have a delay of several hours (they couldn't really tell us how much exactly). Having advised my transport ability from the airport to my final destination that I wouldn't arrive at time, we were told after a good half of the flight that we are going to fly directly to Philadelphia (as initially planned) because we had less wind than expected. The second flight was worse. The plane we were going to take arrived at Philly 20 min later than planned, so everything already was a bit delayed. After sitting in this machine over 1h without departing, we had to change plane(!) which lasted another hour, so we arrived at Amsterdam with over 2 hours of delay. While changing planes in Philadelphia I heard from several passengers that this is typical for AA, that they had come to Philly with a delayed AA flight and that they would never be able to get their train (just as me!) or connecting flight (except an American Airlines flight because that one you get because of its delay again - so if you fly AA, only fly AA). If there weren't all the other critical aspects in comparison to the flights' price. On other transatlantic flights of the same duration and price with Lufthansa or KLM, a personal screen with plenty of movies to chose is standard. Just as 2 ordinary meals plus snacks and comfortable seats with room for legs. On each of these 2 American Airlines flights, I had a disgusting meal and a tiny snack, there were small screens over every 5th row you can't see well from the mayority of seats (I had the luck of having one of these) and the seat couldn't be adjusted more than 2 inches backwards, so falling asleep wasn't possible for me, also because of permanent knee-seat-contact and the absolute impossibility of stretching my legs. It was horrible - in comparison with normal airlines such as Lufthansa or KLM."
2570,"Fort Myers to Portland on American Airlines. I booked tickets for my 3 year old, my husband, myself and our 1yr and a half old. When I was checking in for our flight back home it showed our seats completely scattered on the plane and when I purchased our tickets they were together. Now they tell me that they have no seats together at this time and to check with the airport. I told them to change my flight or change someone's seats cause I will not be sitting away from my child! So not impressed. Never again!"
2571,"My husband and I paid $311 extra for our seats to and from Honolulu for our dream vacation with American Airlines. These fees were so that we could sit together for the flights and for extra leg room. We never got the extra leg room on any of the 4 flights and had to argue with the counter people to even get to sit together. For example, when checking in with AA mobile app (which doesn't work well) for our flight from Honolulu to Phoenix, the app showed our assigned seats as being available for an extra fee (which we had already paid). We were then assigned standard seats (no leg room) and 6 rows apart. Finally, we got a counter agent to at least sit us together for the flight but we were told that this was a ""different plane so seats were different"". If this was even true, isn't it good business to take care of those that paid extra for better seats and then assign remaining standard fare seats? It appears that American charges at least double for this bait and switch. Who knows how many ""extra"" fees they charged for special seating and then assigned standard seats? We know for a fact that they did so on the HNL to PHX flight, as we spoke to the people occupying our originally assigned seats. The flight to Honolulu was so bad that my arm was cramped against the cabin wall resulting in numbness for most of the flight. As a result of not having room to stretch my legs for me, as a diabetic, resulted in my ankles swelling terribly on both 6 hour flights. American should be ashamed of their rude and unapologetic staff and charging fees for services that they do not deliver."
2572,"Flew American Airlines on a 757 from JFK to Miami and returned to La Guardia on a 737, in business class. The service was quite impressive, cabin/toilets clean, seat comfortable, and food was ample with a menu choice -  wine and other drinks served. Flight attendants were informal but got the work done. The entertainment system was old fashioned, with drop down screens from the ceiling, not personalized at the seat level.  Overall, a quality product worth patronizing again!"
2573,"Packed American Airlines flight from Chicago O'Hare to Los Angeles on 1st February in coach. They changed aircraft so row 7 wasn't there anymore so 6 people had to find new seats. Gate agents handled some irate passengers well. Boarding was smooth - departed on time. Flight attendants were very nice and present throughout the flight. They did 2 drink and snack runs and came through with water two times. In-seat videos provided plenty of entertainment choices for the 4 hour flight. Gogo wifi was great - worked throughout the flight. Turbulence was very bad 30 minutes out of LAX due to El-Nino winds. Pilot kept us informed and did a good job. Landed smoothly and was a good flight. AA gets really bad reviews here - I fly them 150,000 miles a year and yes - I've had some bad flights. But overall they do a good job. I think a lot of people just expect to be treated like a king when they pay $300 for a trip. Keep up the good work AA."
2574,"New York to Las Vegas with American Airlines, and terrible customer service. Extremely rude staff at the check-in counter. No in-flight entertainment on a 6+ hour flight. No complimentary beer/wine, snacks or meals on the flight. I flew LAX to JFK, JFK to Las Vegas, Las Vegas to Phoenix and Phoenix to Honolulu all within a 2 week period and all but one of the flights were delayed. Very little information passed on to the customers."
2575,Philadelphia to Austin via Dallas. We were originally booked on American Airlines flight for Sunday (day of the big storm). Flight cancelled and rebooked via Indianapolis the following day (Monday). We were also cancelled from this flight though I did receive notification that all the connection flights flew on this day - so the plane not cancelled we were bumped. Then scheduled for Tuesday via Dallas except we were on a first class tickets x 3 and sitting in the rear of the plane on Row 36. No contact or email of the airline event though they had this because I spoke to their operator and gave it all to them. First class was fine from Dallas to Austin but American Airlines have lost a client for lack of service.
2576,"Orange County to London via Dallas Ft Worth with American Airlines, and very good service.  Pretty nice aircraft, good food, and friendly staff. Entertainment on board was very cool, screens were new and working. For the ground service, I have never met such unfriendly people. "
2577,"Flew from St Louis to Dallas / Fort Worth to get a connecting flight to Colorado Springs. Unfortunately the weather was bad and my connecting flight was cancelled. What irritated me was the American Airlines employees had no procedure and were not helpful at all. After talking to 3 different employees I finally found one that had a flight to Arkansas the next morning to get a connecting flight from Delta to Denver, CO. After arriving in Arkansas, I went up to Delta to get my boarding pass and they had no record of me! The American Airlines employee failed to send my info or even inform me that I didn't actually have a seat for the connecting flight, but rather sent me there to just get me out of Fort Worth. I was literally stranded there -  there was 11 other people in the same situation. I had to rent a car and drive from Arkansas to Colorado. Luckily I split the cost with 5 other people who also drove with me. What did I get from aa after filing a complaint? $130 from $630 that I spent on the tickets. Moral of the story - never fly with American Airlines."
2578,"Flew in to Dallas from New Delhi, India on Emirates in economy class where everyone on the ground and in the air were helpful and friendly. Arrived at Dallas Fort Worth and went to the American Airlines Counter to get our boarding passes to Des Moines, Iowa. Staff at the American Airlines Counter were rude and impatient. I had asked about the terminal where we were supposed to go and she snapped, ""C! It says C right there!"" I had to remind her that I was not familiar with DFW airport. Then, we get on the plane. No greeting from the stewardesses. One stewardess started barking orders at my husband on how to put the carry-on in the overhead bin. No helpful advice. She just stood there with her hands on her hips barking at him. "
2579,"Flew American Airlines from Dallas to London Heathrow with a Boeing 777 (a ten-abreast seating). Very cramped class, the seat very uncomfortable with almost no recline. The IFE was limited, The crew wasn't attentive and rather boring. The served food did not taste nice. Not recommended."
2580,American Airlines flight to Chicago cancelled. Flown to Houston for connecting flight. Connecting flight cancelled. Eventually connected via different airline to Chicago. Total time 27 hours. Complained to American who don't care in their responses. My wife required a special dietary meal which of course was unavailable on all replacement flights.
2581,"This was the worst travel experience I have had. I had arrived at Philadelphia Airport to board a flight from Philadelphia to Allentown to find out my flight had been delayed 2.5 hours. After waiting 2.5 hours they then decided to inform me that my flight had been cancelled due to ""mechanical error"". I then proceeded to wait another 1 hour to simply have my checked bag returned to me in baggage claim. American Airlines is the most unprofessional and discourteous airline I have encountered. Do not fly American Airlines."
2582,"I broke my leg shortly after booking a flight with American Airlines from Montreal to Manchester via Philadelphia so called Reservations to request upgraded seats. They made me pay $52 for seats on both connecting flights, but ultimately I only received an 'upgrade' on the first flight. Even then, there was no actual legroom, they just stuck me on the front row where I could be knocked by the flight attendants for the entire flight. On the second flight I was completely ignored and not given what I paid for."
2583,"Chicago to Atlanta with a 7 seven-hour delay, including 2.5 hours sitting on the plane, for a few inches of snow and some icy rain. While we sat on the plane, they kept announcing that equipment was malfunctioning and delaying us. Yes, weather can happen, but there was no attention to customer satisfaction after that - not even a little extra like free food. We lost $72 needing to get a hotel room near Atlanta that night, losing the money for the pre-booked hotel in Savannah we couldn't get to. I wrote American hoping for some level of refund, but they just answered ""we can't control the weather."" American is ranked 9th out of 10 airlines, and I see why now. Don't use it!"
2584,"Chicago to London Heathrow with American Airlines, and it was graceless from start to finish. No wait at check-in and through security in about 25 minutes. On a business class ticket you can access the Admirals Club lounge, which comes with a coupon for one free drink (including bottled water)!. Even then there's an expectation that you'll have to tip the barman who provides it. Otherwise, it's a few cheese crackers, cheese cubes and assorted nuts. There's a water fountain in the lounge, if you're really thirsty. Boarding was quick and stress free, and the refurbished Boeing 767-300 business class cabin offers a lof of personal space. There was a very long and unexplained wait after boarding until the doors were closed, and a further wait until pushback. You'd think that the flight attendants would be thinking ahead to how they'd be able to get on with service quicker on a night flight, such as taking dinner and drinks orders, but no, all standing around in the galley chatting. After take-off the flight attendants got out of their seats after 30 minutes. The next step was to manually log out 30 entertainment tablets and noise-cancelling earphones, so that was another 30 minutes gone. It was 90 minutes from take-off before the first drink hit the table. Dinner orders were then taken, and the meal service got under way. The cabin was kept at full illumination, with no attempt to create any form of night-time ambience. The starter was a mushroom carpaccio, which was very tasty, followed by what you'd think would a safe option 'steak in demi-glaze of blue-cheese'. The demi-glaze looked like oatmeal, and the steak was bloody in the middle, so after a few cuts, the blood started running everywhere, and it quickly became a pink, inedible mess. The dessert was ice-cream, which took a full 15 minutes before you could even crack off a chip with a spoon. The flight attendants were regularly doing the rounds throughout the flight, and nobody wanted for a drink. I passed on on the breakfast option of a quiche lorraine and spicy sausage, as this seemed like the perfect recipe for early-morning heartburn. The seat was extremely comfortable, but if you're looking for a business class product that delivers some style and atmosphere, this isn't it."
2585,"Los Angeles to Sydney, and awful American Airlines check in staff who were rude and unpleasant. I was moved seats and sat completely separately from my family, despite having an arm in a sling and a hand in plaster. When I was upset and crying, I was told to be quiet. The onboard service was unfriendly, the flight attendant kept banging into me and the food was awful. Certainly not service with a smile. I will never fly with American Airlines again."
2586,"Good luck getting anything from American Airlines customer service. We had a connecting flight cancelled (radio failure) in Miami on New Years Eve, stranding us for two days and then we were finally rerouted through Boston (from Miami!) to get to San Diego when our first make up flight was delayed. Inconvenient, but not horrible until we tried to get reimbursed for hotel (Miami on NYE), basic clothing, and food needs (family of 5). You have to put your request in online and guess what? They won't respond for 6-8 weeks. Tried calling and they only have canned response to wait for the online response. You are stuck and there is nothing you can do about it. Pretty amazing that such a large company can get away with no accountability. Looking back I would have made that entire line of 200 unhappy customers wait until I got some better answers than save receipts and you will be reimbursed."
2587,"We have flown US airways for years prior to their takeover by American Airlines. US Airways customer service was professional and accommodating to the customer. We purchased tickets for a trip from Fayetteville to Montego Bay in April 2016 months ago. American airlines canceled two of our initial connecting flights we had booked, no problem we understand its business on their part. But when they rescheduled our flights for us the new flight times did not allow time between flights for customs, rechecking bags as we re-entered the country and changing terminals. When we called to get assistance changing these new flights (that AA had changed) their representatives were anything but accommodating! Rude as I explained that we could not make connecting flights as they had rescheduled, the supervisor told me I could say the sky was blue but it didn't change that they couldn't refund me for flights I wanted to cancel - and remember they are the ones who changed my flight scheduling flights without enough time to make connections. She just kept telling me no refund because it was me wanting a schedule change. When I asked her to help me cancel these flights altogether and start a new flight schedule she said no, that I needed to go online and do it myself, because our call had already taken 60 minutes. I reminded her we were American Airlines card members and that help booking by phone was one of our privileges - still no help."
2588,"Las Vegas to Sydney via Los Angeles, and American Airlines are by far the worst airline I have travelled. Not only did they delay our flight by 2 hours resulting in a plane full of people missing their connect from LAX to Australia, but they were completely unhelpful with the reorganisation of all of the missed flights. We waited from 10:30pm - 3:00am to have our flight rescheduled (which left over 24 hours after our original flight) and have accommodation organised. We arrived at our accommodation to find that American Airlines credit card declined 4 times. We were then asked if we would go to a new hotel at 2:30am which required us to use a shuttle that left every 20 min to go back to the airport and then go on a 2nd 20min shuttle to go to the new hotel. It is currently 3:30am and they are yet to provide a credit card that has been accepted for a $115 payment. They also provided a $7 food voucher. All of that aside, we were treated so poorly by each of the American air staff we encounted and I really couldn't speak more poorly of any airline travel situation. Bitterly disappointed."
2589,"After boarding our American Airlines 5am flight from Chicago to Dallas, we were informed that the water system was not working and maintenance was being called to look into it as there would be no water for coffee or toilets. After 40 minutes, advised that maintenance needed to isolate etc etc. After almost an hour of sitting on the plane, we were finally asked to get off plane and go to another gate to board another flight. The guy making announcements was whispering so we all weren't quite sure which gate. When asking the lady at the gate for clarification she was barking at everyone and acting like we were bothering her. Waking up at 2:30am for a 5am flight with an eta of 7:30am is doable if it goes according to plan - this was painful.  Needless to say, I was not quite sure I was in capable hands after 2 hours of them fumbling around. We got to Dallas 2hrs later! Thankfully we did not have a connecting flight after. And after all that, there was no coffee offered on the flight! All in all, working for American Airlines would be an embarrassing experience and flying them a big gamble."
2590,"We booked a flight from Barbados to London Gatwick in First Class with American Airlines, which through its codesharing put us on a British Airways flight. This British Airways flight was delayed by 7.5 hours and we were downgraded from First Class to Business class because the replacement aircraft did not have a First Class Cabin. American Airlines offered us 7,500 reward miles as compensation which I found to be unacceptable, and after writing to them, they replied essentially stating that they valued us as customers, reviewed our case and felt the compensation was adequate. EU regulation 261 states that any flight delay greater than 5 hours warrants compensation of Euro600 per customer (it was operated by British Airways but they insisted that any compensation issue had to be done with AA with whom we originally booked). American Airlines refused to acknowledge this requirement."
2591,"Enjoyable flight from San Francisco to Miami with American Airlines. It departed and arrived on time though nearly an hour to wait for a bay at Miami, apparently due to weather. The inflight service is very basic though - basically just a drinks service. I did overhear the male flight attendant telling the passenger behind us that the sandwiches for sale weren't flash. For a 5 hour flight on a full service airline, one would think they could include snacks."
2592,"My husband and I were on a 10 hour American Airlines flight from Chicago to Rome for our honeymoon this past fall. I became severely dehydrated and became ill. The entire crew aboard were so sweet and helped me feel better about the incident, especially two staff who went above and beyond. One of them even gave me a change of clothes since mine were ruined and I didn't have a spare in my carry on. Kudos to both these attendants and the entire flight crew on this flight. "
2593,"American Airlines from London Heathrow to Chicago was one of the best business flights I've had for a long time.  Check-in and bag-drop took seconds and the lounge was quiet and fairly empty first thing in the day. I chose this flight as it was the newly-configured business cabin on the Boeing 767-300. Overall impression very good, seemed spacious and every seat is an aisle seat, which is a huge plus. I had a window seat, and it actually was a window seat - rather other airlines where you sit at an angle and have to twist to look out. The seat had a large fixed table area between the seat and the aisle, so there was no possibility of being knocked by someone on their way past. Like all new products there were a few design issues. You have to be more or less upright before you can release and then raise the table, but you get the hang of it eventually. The seat controls are very sensitive and you can often accidentally move your seat if you arm is laying where it normally would. The meal service was good, pre-ordered main course was there, and it seemed a very honest product. A very cheap appetiser, just humous, olives and pitta bread but then a delicious fish main course, with a choice of dessert and cheese. You had to wait for the entertainment system to be distributed after take-off, in the form of content loaded tablets and noise-reducing headphones. The 767's were always noisy old crates, but if you take along your own headphones and entertainment, there's no need to wait for theirs (although there is a huge choice of material). The seat was one of the most comfortable I've sat in for ages, it moved around easily, and in combination with a built in footstool, it wans't long before I had found the perfect position and was so comfortable I didn't want to get up. I'm tall, and couldn't reach the back of the footwell however hard I tried, so it felt like there was real space to stretch out. The afternoon snack was again straightforward, a charcuterie plate of meats, cheeses and breads plus cookies. Looked after well by the flight attendants throughout the flight. I'll be booking this airline and aircraft again."
2594,"London to Cancun via Miami with American Airlines, ands the flight in general was okay. Meals alright. Seat in business class was pretty comfy. Staff a little scary, but relatively polite. We have had a major problem with our luggage however. When we arrived in Cancun, one of our 2 suitcase didn't arrive. The AA computer reports that it is in Miami and it will follow the next morning on the 9am flight, so we happily head to our hotel. We've never seen the bag since and it's now 3 weeks later. If we check on the computer, it says the bag has not been located and to check back later. If we call, we are told the same thing. I feel like no-one is looking for my bag and it's just a case of 'computer says no'. All they tell us is to fill out their outdated paper based property form and send off a claim with receipts for all items over a certain value (which we don't have for everything in the case). I feel like no-one cares that my bag with some prized possessions has gone missing and they will just pay out - I'm expecting less than the full amount the case is worth, due to not being able to provide receipts for things that were a gift / more than a couple of years old. This would definitely put me off travelling with them again."
2595,"Horrible flight from Vancouver to Boston via Dallas. Worst ever. When I got our boarding passes in Vancouver, the seats I paid $75 extra each for in row 8 were not the ones I was given, even though I had the confirmation. When I asked the girl at the American Airlines desk she couldn't help me and said to ask in Dallas. I called customer service, they still had me listed in row 8, not in row 17 and 16 (my son and I weren't even together now), then my wallet app ticket updated so I called customer service again - they still had us in row 8. In Dallas we were stuck with rows 17 and 16, not the seats I paid for, and then found out how difficult it is to get a refund for something that is clearly their fault. We got to Boston at 12:37am and our 4 bags, two suitcases and two ski bags didn't make it. The woman at the counter was rude. I reviewed a call in the morning saying my two ski bags made it and would be delivered by 2pm (I should mention my son was going back to college the next day) but they didn't know where my other two bags were and I was told to call back in a bit. I call back and my two bags were still in Texas and they ""hoped"" they would be here on the 3 pm flight. I called the 800 number quite a few times trying to get a straight answer and was told different things each time. Finally around 5pm I was told my other two bags had made it to Boston. I called to see where my ski bags were as it was past 2 and no bags yet. I was told they didn't make it to Boston until 2 so how could they be promised to be here by then I was told. Finally the driver called and said he'd have my ski bags here by 11pm! I never heard about the delivery of my other two bags so I called once again, got told they would ""rush"" the delivery as 4 hours later they were still at the airport - finally I got an email saying the delivery has started. The ski bags arrived close to 11 and the other two bags about 10 min later. What a hellish experience. We had to waste my sons last day home for winter break waiting for suitcases that didn't come when we were told, and I made hours of phone calls and was given a run around. I am confident had I not called and kept after my bags, they'd still be out there. Horrible customer service and they lie. I will do my best to never fly this airline again."
2596,"San Francisco to Chicago O'Hare, and a well-run flight from American Airlines. Despite having a low-cost economy ticket, I was given Priority Access for free, which meant I had plenty of time to board the plane, put away my bags and get settled. Cabin service was polite. American Airlines is in my opinion, the most reliable of the three major US carriers."
2597,"Dallas to Quito with American Airlines. It was clean and new cabin, with comfortable seats. The meal was bad - just a  sandwich. It is an international flight and just a sandwich is served. Be ready and take some food with you. Only 1 glass of water was offered, and this is not fair on an international flight, we have to buy food at the airport. They should improve by including some food. I believe that Delta and LAN Ecuador have better choices."
2598,"The temperature of the aircraft on or flight from Dallas Fort Worth to Fargo was so hot it melted the chocolate candy bars my husband and I had. He was sitting toward the front and I was over the wing area. We did not mention it to the flight attendant because she was so rude to begin with. I spoke with a number of other passengers and they all felt it was extremely hot. We were nauseous by the time our 2.75 hr flight was over. The temperature wasn't the part that upset me as much as the flight attendant's attitude. One of the other passengers asked for more ice and the flight attendant said ""I will in just a bit, like I told the other guy, I only have two hands"". Unnecessary rudeness."
2599,"My review is about the customer service rather than the flight itself. I recently booked an American Airlines flight from Austin to Oakland but found other more time-friendly flights. After cancelling the flight, I inquired about a refund. The representative told me the charge was $200 for rebooking - more than the original ticket cost. Obviously I was angry. After speaking with a manager at their Phoenix Reservation Service Center, my fee was waived. It was not of course without expressing my displeasure with the airline's policy. I decided to rebook the flight for the sake of convenience and cost - why use another airline if I could not receive a refund? Passengers would do well to be wary of nonrefundable tickets and hidden fees."
2600,"Flew LAX to Sydney on the relatively new American Airlines service and I was very impressed. I love the business class seats on their Boeing 777 - same as Cathay Pacific, very private and comfortable. I am 6ft 4 and was very comfortable when the bed was flat. The meals were great and the crew were very obliging. I wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again over the Pacific and would choose them before the Qantas skybed any day."
2601,"The American Airlines flight from Detroit to San Antonio was not overly noteworthy. They handled the flight as expected with friendly staff, nice aircrafts, and pleasant flight times. However on the return trip, my girlfriend and myself were not impressed in the least. We arrived two hours early for our flight as expected and proceeded to wait for our plane. We weren't informed at any time that our aircraft was behind schedule, however it landed roughly twenty minutes past the time we were supposed to board. After the plane arrived we were informed that no carryon ""larger than a briefcase"" do all passangers needed to valet check their bags. This created an interesting issue when boarding as a pile of carryons began to block the path onto the plane. After boarding a plane that seemed to have been built in the seventies, we were informed that we were not going to be able to leave for 40 minutes due to weather in our connector in chicago; something that is to be expected this time of year. What wasn't expected was the condescending attitude of the entire staff. A fellow passanger stated that they needed to check the landing time, because he was going to a military funeral he would rather not miss. The flight attendant stated that they couldn't control the weather and walked away. After a hellish two and a half hour flight in an old, loud, cramped plane we arrived in Chicago for our layover. We than had to wait twenty minutes in the jetway while they unloaded each individual bag into the mass of passangers; noteworthy at this time is that Chicago was sitting at 6 degrees. We rush through the terminal to our connector flight and make it right as the plane is boarding. I give the employer at the gate my ticket and begin to walk to the airplane. He cleared his throat and stated my bags, that I had taken all of the way to Texas as a carryon, were to large for the flight. I inform him they are the same ones we went down to Texas with, but apparently that is not enough. Because he stated that I must place them into a size verifier to show that they are in fact acceptable. I preceeded to place them into the bracket, which showed them to clearly be the correct size. His response was to turn around and simply walk away, leaving me to puzzle over the correct next step. Overall, I felt belittled, and outright disrepected. I will not be taking another American Airlines flight due to this dreadful experience, even if it means higher costs or less ideal landing times."
2602,"We arrived at the airport at 10am and missed our 5pm American Airlines Miami to Houston flight due to gate changes. The staff was unbelievably accommodating. They heard our story and really worked with us to find a solution. We were put on a 11:30pm flight. The flight attendants were so kind to us, and they turned a nightmare into an absolutely great experience. I would recommend this airline, strictly based on the staff that we encountered on our trip."
2603,"I will pay a premium to fly with other airlines in the future. Our American Airlines departure from Miami was so stressful after a much needed vacation to decompress. We arrived 2-1/2 hours early and went to the AA terminal to check in. There were lines at every kiosk and hundreds of people waiting on line throughout. We got on line and waited 40 minutes at a kiosk (several were out of service it seems). Everyone who got a turn at bat eventually arrived a problem which required a customer service person to come over and help them. The help mainly consisted of sending them to the baggage check/kiosk service lines. Our turn was no different. As our baggage tags began to print, the machine had a glitch, indicating that it was probably out of tag stickers. We flagged down a customer rep who - you guessed it - sent us to the baggage check/kiosk service line where we waited another hour plus. Everyone we watched was having to remove stuff from their bags and this was very time consuming. When we got to the front of the line, they weighed our bag (which was the identical bag we had flown in with - nothing added!) and told us it was 2 lbs over and we could remove items or pay a $100 upcharge for the overweight bag. Since by now our flight was boarding and we still had not gone through security, we felt compelled to pay the charge. As we were boarding, our daughter with a smaller bag carry on was forced to check it anyway, as most of the other passengers were also being forced to check. (Why did we bother to stand in line for 2 hours if the flight attendants were tagging bags at boarding?) A woman on our flight told us how they were forced to layover in Miami overnight after waiting in the airport all day. They were not comped for their room. Several people on that flight missed connections for their vacations, and one couple missed their cruise. Does American know or care that people save all year to enjoy a vacation and then have to put up with this kind of crap?? We will fly any airline but AA going forward."
2604,"I am an AAdvantage member and American Airlines credit card holder and I was just hung up on by an American Airlines supervisor. I fly monthly to weekly for work with multiple airlines. I am flying with American Airlines tomorrow from Madison to Seattle via Chicago. After my travel agent booked my flight I went onto my mobile app to select my seat. All the open seats had an up charge to select them. So, I decided to wait to get a seat assignment at check in. This morning I checked in on my mobile app. I was assigned a seat and given my boarding pass like usual. A few hours later I got on to the seat selection portion of my app. It showed the seat I was in did not recline. It also showed that all the seats except one in the back still had an up charge. So, I picked the seat in the back of the plane. After confirming my seat change I saw that the seat I had been assigned originally was a preferred seat with extra leg room and priority boarding. It also showed that to move back to that seat I was initially assigned I would have to pay an up charge. I decided to call reservations to see if there was anything I could do to keep the same seat level I'd been assigned but switch to one that reclines. This is a 4 hour flight at 5am after all. The rep said she couldn't explain what happened and couldn't help me because I was already signed in. She did say that it shouldn't have happened (all seats shouldn't have up charges and I should've been able to move seats in the cabin I was assigned). So, I decided to call the mobile app technical support line to see if they could at least tell me what happened. The tech person sent me to a supervisor who was supposed to be able to help. The supervisor listened to me explain what happened then proceeded to accuse me of lying because it didn't line up with the activity on my account. She said I would've had to pay for my original seat assignment claiming I hadn't completed my transaction and had I gone to the ""last screen"" I would've been asked for a credit card. I explained that I didn't ever ask for an upgrade and that I merely checked in and did fully check in without ever being asked for a credit card or told I had priority seating. I also told her I had the preferred seat on my boarding pass. She said that had I kept that seat and gone to the airport tomorrow, I would've been told I had to pay $68 or switch to whatever seats were left open at the back of the plane. I told her that sound strange and didn't seem like great customer service. She then asked ""what are doing right now"". I explained I was just looking for an explanation of what happened (was it an issue with my app?) and looking for someone to make me feel like a valued customer. I really wanted to understand what went wrong, I fly too much to deal with this and have never had anything like this happen before. The woman then rather heatedly announced that they are the best airline in the world. I told her our conversation wasn't demonstrating that and that the reason we were talking right now was because I wanted to give them a chance to show me that. I asked if she could just help me understand what happened and confirm the issue wasn't there for the other leg of my flight. She then told me to have a nice day and hung up on me. I was shocked. I did not use curse words or insult her. I was not screaming though I was frustrated. It was shockingly bad customer service."
2605,"I have been flying frequently for the past several years and American Airlines is the worst airline that I have ever dealt with. I got a call at 11pm the night before my 6am flight from Las Vegas to San Antonio saying that I would be delayed over an hour and a half. I got to the gate of my connecting flight 5 minutes before departure due to the delay and they would not let me on the plane. I had to wait 4 hours for the next connecting flight just to be told that it was delayed another 3 hours. I was supposed to reach my destination at 1:30pm, but instead I got there at 6:45pm. Every time I talked to an employee, whether it was to ask questions or try to change my flight, they were extremely rude. Unless you are willing to deal with horrible customer service and a ridiculous amount of waiting around at the airport, I do not recommend this airline."
2606,"Philadelphia to Denver, and this is my first time flying with American Airlines and I will never fly with them again. I had to have my name changed on my ticket going to to my initial flight and I was in the customer service line. I was yelled at by three different employees in the Denver airport to go print my boarding pass at a kiosk, which I had already done. Then, with my departing flight from Philadelphia, I had to pay for my checked bag with cash. A very nice employee directed me to the correct line. I was standing there for a little while and then a woman behind the desk starts staring at me, yelling at me to go print my boarding pass at a kiosk. I have never ever been treated this way when I am just trying to get on to my flight.  I understand that the kiosks make things easier for everyone, but employees should be trained in being polite to customers to find out what they are in line for before shouting at them. Or at least hire friendlier people if it's that difficult."
2607,"Flew American Airlines Manchester to Chicago, for the first time since the late 2000s, excellent cabin service. Boarding the plane was greeted by friendly staff. Approximately 20 minutes after take off, the drinks service commences along with a bag of pretzels. The first meal follows around 30 minutes after, with another drinks service. Litter is cleared quickly and another beverage service. About 2 hours later a beverage service and ice cream. Approximately 90 minutes before landing, a beverage and second meal is served. The food is decent, didn't like the sandwich, however, would have much preferred the pizza they used to serve. Boeing 757 does not have any seatback televisions except for Business Class, I brought a tablet with films pre-loaded, and it was a life saver. There is mainscreen video, but the TVs are small and a weird aspect ratio. Highly recommend going main cabin extra!"
2608,"I booked flights with British Airways, and I was put on the way back from Orange County to London to travel with their partner, American airlines, via Dallas. The first segment was OK and landed in time in a new Boieng 737-800. There was WiFi on board, although very very expensive. The problems started in Dallas, where after boarding, we had to wait in an old Boeing 777-200 for 1.5 hours, for the luggage to be unloaded and redistributed so that the weight of the aircraft to be ideal. After take-off, the IFE started to work, but you couldn't just play the movie you wanted, you could either jump in the middle of it, or wait about 15 minutes until it will start again. As it wasn't enough, this system went out of power doing the middle of the movie, the crew had no idea and after 30 minutes it came back to life. Of course, I had to watch a movie 3 times from the beginning as you couldn't fast forward or anything. The food was generally bad, as was the wine they gave us. Just a small blanket and a pillow, no other things for the night. The crew didn't give much of an interest. I guess the old entertainment system was just because it was a night flight (scheduled departure 22:10) and not many people use it. That is why I rate it as an average experience. I will try for the future not to fly them."
2609,"Our outbound flights with British airways were fine plenty of drinks and food included, however the connecting flights in the US are with American Airlines and were outrageous. We flew from New York back to Manchester with American Airlines. We booked in 3 hours before take off to arrange we sat together.  We were made to book in by machine in the terminal. They seated us nowhere near each other although seats together were plainly visible on said console, when we mentioned this to the staff they told us we would be able to change this at the gate. No you can't. The stroppy little madam who appears half an hour before gate closure refused point blank to alter seating, despite families with young children being separated, unless you paid extra for seating. There was no attempt to seat people together in New York. The entertainment for the flight to Manchester was a tiny overhead screen you couldn't see in the centre aisle which weren't worth neck ache to see. Food and drinks were okay, thank goodness the flight was only 7 hours. Only two toilets. The internal flights between destinations in America were worse - we were only offered three drinks, one of which was water, no food despite the flight being 7 hours. American Airlines does not include food and drinks. So when booking through British Airways and paying out more money for what you believe is a good company, remember that when flying to US the affiliated flights with American Airlines are comparable to Ryanair or flybe."
2610,"Houston to Montrose, and I will never again fly with American Airlines. On December 23, 2015, I waited 1 hr and 15 mins. for my bags to be unloaded and put on the baggage claim belt. When I went and asked an American Airlines Agent she told me my bags where already on the belt. When I went to check, they were not. I proceeded to wait and then went again and inquired about my bags. The same lady once again said they were on the belt. She ended up lying to me 5 times and multiple times to other passengers that were on my plane. One person asked to speak to a manager and was told that the manager could not be concerned with our problem. Then on December 27, 2015, my flight was cancelled and instead of helping me book another flight I was left to book my own flight. When I finally found a flight and asked if there was a quicker flight to my city 4 different American Airlines Agents would not even look up to see if such a flight existed."
2611,"Check-in experience with American Airlines at Dublin was horrible-it took 45 minutes and during this time all passengers were subject to inept security 'interviews' with clueless AA staff. Invasive and pointless. After that we did the endless security and pre-clearence routine for a US bound flight out of Dublin. Took over 2 hours to simply arrive at the gate. Flight was on time to Philadelphia, late to Halifax. Food bad, but liquor offering good. Leg room was reasonable for today's Economy class. We were near the back of the aircraft, but this A330 has a sensible 2-4-2 configuration and we had the 2 by the window which is nice for a couple. Seat back entertainment didn't work for me, USB chargers on both seats didn't work. Cabin crew weren't exactly professional, and down right silly on the PHL-YHZ leg (not aware that Halifax has a different time zone, no idea of scheduled arrival time, generally inarticulate). The aircraft from PHL-YHZ (operated by American Eagle) had an old plane smell, and the bleak interior of the ERJ 145 seemed to be yellowing with age. Good communication from the pilots on this leg, which was necessary as there were repeated delays ending in a 30 minute broken down jetway farce at the Halifax airport. Overall AA falls well below Lufthansa and BA in terms of basic service."
2612,"Pittsburgh to San Diego via LAX. The worst consumer experience of my life. My flight for Tuesday morning was canceled at midnight. 3 hours on the phone, with numerous people telling me I'll be delayed for 3+ days. Finally at 3am, a supervisor finds me a flight leaving in a couple hours. Hustle to the airport and the lines are crazy at 5am. Not enough employees and the logistics were terrible. Fast forward and I arrive home in San Diego. My luggage didn't join me. I went to the baggage office and it turns out the check-in person in Pittsburgh put the wrong code on my bag. I filed the appropriate claim. Fast forward 5 days, no bag arrives at my home. Now, I've spent the last 2 days listening to terrible elevator music for 4+ hours on hold with ""central baggage services"" without hearing a human voice. I will never again willingly purchase a ticket for American Airlines. "
2613,"We booked our American Airlines flight from Atlanta to Dublin with a 1 hour 30 min stop in Philadelphia several months before we were set to fly in December. We arrived early for our 5:30pm flight. We received notification that our flight was now 1 hour 35 minutes delayed which meant we would miss our connection flight to Dublin. We called the hotline for assistance and they were very rude and not helpful. We arrived at 8:40pm to catch a 9:10pm flight. We were on a small plane so we had to wait for our valeted bags, run from gate F 23 to a bus to take us to A 23. I attempted to ask the gate agent to radio the other gate to let them know we were on our way. They told me ""we don't hold planes for anyone"" and proceeded to laugh at me and then looked at me with a puzzling stare when I told them we were headed to Ireland. We ran through the airport and made it to the gate at 8:59 as the doors were closing. I was dripping in sweat and good barely breath as I gave the ticket to the gate agent. I said ""I'm sorry it's the airlines fault we are late."" She said ""it most certainly is not!"". I said ""our plane was delayed 1 hour 35 minutes!"".  She said ""well it's not my fault!"". If we were not young and in relatively good shape and had some luck with the bus being quick, we would have not made this flight. The onboard crew were excellent and efficient but the customer service and gate agents were the worst I have ever dealt with. I have flown a lot in my life with several different airlines and this was by far the worst experience. American Airlines has lost my business forever."
2614,"Dublin to Las Vegas via Philadelphia for our honeymoon. The plane was serviceable, food fine, movies fine.  The staff were friendly, courteous and helpful.  When you needed something they gave it to you. No big fuss, just simple good manners. We had one flight delay between Vegas and Cancun but the American Airlines staff did everything they could to make sure it wasn't a complete mess - and things worked out okay. Our flight back to Dublin with no drama, nice staff. "
2615,"The worst experience. Arrived at Newark 5am for a 6:30am American Airlines flight to Sacramento. Nearly an hour in line to check in, and then the conveyor belts were not working so luggage had to be manually loaded onto carts. Only two employees working all the counters - they were frazzled beyond belief. Just barely got to the plane on time. Airline knows how many tickets it sells so there is no excuse for its counters to be understaffed. Then on the return trip during a layover in Dallas/Ft. Worth, the plane to Newark had ""maintenance issues"" which cost us an additional 1.5 hours delay."
2616,"We purchased first class seats to fly New York to Buenos Aires return. American Airlines called me a few days before departing to inform about an aircraft change from three class to two class only - I requested the refund from my First Class fare to the new Business Class fare. AA started to go around giving us excuses, and I was able to obtain a partial refund when checking in at JFK. AA oversold the returning flight in the business class. I called customer service and I was transferred to the ""resolution department"". Half an hour on the phone with zero assistance. We went to the airport knowing that AA took away our seats selection. The line for check in and the area was horrible (First Class). We got the boarding pass with no seats assigned and no boarding gate provided. We finally got our seats, 10 minutes prior to boarding in a nasty boarding area with no AC in summer time. The new Boeing 777 did not have the promoted walk in bar and the windows that are supposed to provided with privacy in the middle seats did not work - I'm still waiting to get the full refund between first class paid, toward business class provided with a horrible travel experience. Mails were sent with no response at all. AA should stop painting old airplanes and spending money in advertising, and provide better service and maintenance in the airplanes."
2617,"I had to wait until mid-December to buy American Airlines tickets for my 7 year old daughter to come to California to visit for the holidays, I didn't think I was going to be able to afford it, or find accommodating flights for the days I was hoping for. I was helped with the entire process for a very fair price considering the timing. My daughter was extremely well taken care of by the staff, and we were 100% informed and helped through the entire process. I'm grateful that everything went as well as it did, AA is my airline for her future trips. (Tickets purchased were economy class, but because of the availability they were able to give my daughter 1st class for these flights - I don't know how often it is able to happen, but it made the unaccompanied minor fee 1000% worth it.)"
2618,"I was travelling American Airlines from Quito to MIA for summer holiday. Such a short trip, but two hours delay on departure that cause me missed the tour with friends. Very disappointed. On my return back to Quito, three hours wasted at the airport, again delayed. Worst experience with American Airlines. I have been using American Airlines since 2010, I was happy with the service, not anymore. Delays were never announced."
2619,"American Airlines has lost my business forever. Cancelled our morning flight on Jan 2 from the Dominican Republic to Miami in the middle of the night. When I called to reschedule they told me the earliest they could book a flight for my family was Jan 6. Four days! I asked for any flight back to the east coast so I could get my young children back to the states and was told there was nothing she could do. No offer of hotel vouchers, no offer of food, not willing to book us on another airline. There were people in the airport who had been there for two days and the line at the counter was hundreds of people deep. There were flights available as we booked ourselves to get back to the US on our own, via another airline. We are currently fighting to get a ticket refund. Absolutely unacceptable behavior by an airline; essentially holding people in a foreign country for 4-5 extra days because they don't want to spend the money to book on a partner airline."
2620,"Sacramento to Fayetteville. I booked this American Airlines round trip back in early October 2015. I paid $900 just to go home for the holidays and without a choice had to purchase a First Class Seat with no seats left on one of the the returning connecting flights. The departure home went smooth but the return to Fayetteville was a nightmare. My original flight out of Sacramento was continuously delayed till 11 am the next morning. Because of this I got bumped like crazy and the worst part I had to deal with before arriving to Dallas was the fact I had no alternative but to sit there until 4am the next morning and reclaim my luggage to recheck by that time to. No food before the checkpoint but luckily being Military there was a USO with cots to sleep on.  I waited back at the terminal B but the AA counter did not open past 4am as a few other showed up. My hit time was passing and I ran to another terminal when I found out it was actually open. The response from the attendant was I was too late and should have 'known better' to come to that terminal. By this time I was exhausted, hungry, and worn out. I got lucky with a flight in the next hour. I get to Charlotte, NC with another delayed flight and find out I'm actually on standby. The flight to Fayetteville is a later time and have to wait till then to see if I'm able to get a seat. Finally after arriving to Fay, NC I go to get my luggage. Turns out they didn't send it and the bags are still in Charlotte.  In the end the only person who was around was a nice baggage man who got my bags to me later that night. I was a day late signing back in with the Military and with that First Class Seat wasted $30 as that never happened. Also the insurance bringing the unfortunate cost to $990 + tax which was not worth it. My car parked gained an extra day also of $12 on the parking ticket. I will never use American Airlines again."
2621,"I was a transit passenger connecting in JFK from London to Caracas on AA2559. I fell in line to recheck my baggage at the counter in Terminal 8 more than 2 hours prior scheduled departure. The line was long and slow. By the time the agent got to me they told me it was too late and I missed my flight, even tho I was at the counter 1 hour and 6 min prior my departure. I protested saying I already had my boarding pass issued in London and all I was doing was dropping off and rechecking my luggage, but AA failed in providing a counter just to drop bags and staff was incredible slow. I was placed on the next day's flight via Miami but was not provided any meals and lodging even if I was stranded beyond my control. I understand that as a transit passenger I had 120 minutes to make a legal connection; and that included deplanning, clearing immigration and customs, rechecking luggage, and walking to the gate. I do not understand why I was refused boarding if I presented myself more than 120 minutes prior departure only for rechecking luggage. Also, neither in the flight from NY to Miami, nor to the one to Caracas there was not vegetarian meal option, or wifi, even though it shows up when I was booking the flight and is also told loud in the message that is played inside the aircraft - when asked to the flight attendant, they told me no."
2622,"La Guardia to Palm Beach. I was travelling back from spending Christmas break with my family in NY and required extra luggage for my gifts. When I landed in West Palm Beach I was upset to find that one of my suitcases was broken (the handle would not pull up). When I returned home I was even more upset to see that 3 of my gifts which were carefully wrapped and placed safely inside my suitcase were broken. I paid $25 for my first bag and $35 for the second, totaling $60 in luggage fees. I am extremely upset to find that my bags were not properly taken care of. I have never ever experienced issues with luggage before and this was the first time in several years I have flown with American Airlines. I will not fly them again."
2623,"Tampa to San Diego. The worst airline I've encountered. They have zero regard for their customers and (aside from the flight attendants) have the most apathetic, unfeeling staff. I missed all of my original flights, my rebooked connecting flights to my final destination due to their own delays. When I reached out to American Airlines I received no assistance in rectifying or easing my problem. I'm now stuck in Dallas sleeping at the terminal running 12 hours behind my original schedule. I will never recommend this airline."
2624,"Barbados to Santo Domingo via Miami. First leg of journey fine. Arrived in Miami and at the boarding gate, announcement made that the flight is cancelled. Then the agent mentions that the sign is incorrect and it's not our flight that has been cancelled, it's another flight. We are moved to another gate. Board plane on time. Half way through boarding pilot announces that there is a crack in the windshield, so we have to deplane. We are moved to a new plane at another gate, but our crew decides not to bother moving, so we are told that because there is now no crew, we will not be flying. Told to go to Customer Services to get hotel vouchers and meal vouchers. The line at Customer Services is over 3 hours long. Yes, 3 hours. We wait and wait and wait. Customer service staff could not be ruder. They say ""there are no hotels, you can book your own but American Airlines will not pay more than US$ 75"". I ask where we are supposed to sleep. ""On the floor"" said the agent. I ask for my bags to be returned, and am told this will not be possible. I have to pay $30 for a taxi and $230 for a hotel and wear dirty clothes again. Next day I get the flight to Santo Domingo, and check with agent in business class lounge and also at gate that my bags are boarding. Both confirm yes. When I arrive at Santo Domingo, no bags. Baggage agent confirms that both bags are still in Miami but will come later that evening on the 9.30pm flight. I say I will send a driver to pick them up. Driver arrives at airport, one bag has arrived, the other not. Baggage rep says it will come on next flight arriving 1am, and they will send on to me - even though they don't have my address. Next day I send another driver to the airport, he picks up second bag. When I open it, a present was missing. I call American Airlines and am told to return to the airport to make a report. Throughout all of this, not one person has apologised. "
2625,"I will never fly American Airlines again, the service is awful. We flew round trip to the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe (Pointe a Pitre) via Charlotte and Miami inbound, and via San Juan and Miami outbound. We flew a mix of first and business class. We did not experience any delays or cancellations but the basic service you would expect in first class wasn't there. Leaving Seattle, we were able to access the Alaska Airlines lounge with our first class boarding pass, however when we got to Charlotte we were expecting to spend our 7 hrs layover in the lounge, but turns out, American Airlines does not allow lounge access to it's domestic first class passengers (even though we were flying to an international destination)! This was quite a shock to us, we fly Alaska all the time, and never have this issue. Service onboard was not what you would expect in first class, seats on most flights were pretty uncomfortable, the food was ok, except for the flight from Charlotte to Miami, where ""lunch"" was a bag of chips (on a 2hrs + flight), on this flight we notice the flight attendant serve herself a 3 course meal. We had a lost bag on the inbound flight. The only decent service we received was on the flight between Miami and Pointe a Pitre, it was operated by American Eagle."
2626,"On December 27th, my husband and I had tickets to fly out of Newark airport into Charlotte, then San Juan PR. When we arrived at the airport there was confusion amongst everyone. We waited for what seemed to be over 2 hours to see an agent. The agents left the economy class to serve priority customers. All three agents served priority. No one was at the counter for economy class. Several customers and I tried to speak with the supervisor, but she refused to speak to us. One gentleman was nice enough to take care of us. We found out that our flight was cancelled. My husband and I had to return home, which cost us $55.00, then catch the next available flight the next evening leaving JFK. This cost us another 65.00. We arrived San Juan at 2am on the 29th. We lost 1 full day, plus one night of our vacation time. On Jan 2, we were assigned to return home. We had two carry on bags because we were not planning on taking the connecting flight. When we were on line to aboard the plane, the young girl said, you will have to check your bags, with no explanation. I said, we can't because we are not taking the connecting flight. She never looked at me. She just repeated, ""you Have to check your bags, you will get them at the gate on the other side!"" When we went onboard there were many empty bins. I asked the steward, why did the young girl at the gate make us check our bags if there are several empty bins. He apologized and said, she should have checked with us first. I have to say I didn't feel safe or supported with most of the staff working for American Airlines. My husband and I felt we were treated very poorly. We've been traveling regularly. We used other carriers and never experienced such unprofessional behavior. "
2627,"I posted earlier about the late arrival of the Heathrow to Miami flight, with subsequent missing of the connection and my complaint about the treatment of my daughter and her friend by American Airlines staff. In the interests of balance, American Airlines did put them up in a hotel at no cost and managed to get them on the first flight to St Thomas's this morning, therefore they should be able to continue with their holiday as scheduled, so I would like to thank American Airlines for that. "
2628,"Boston to Cozumel via Miami return at peak travel time (Dec. 26 out and Jan. 2 in). All flights on new A321. Six in our group, had the premium economy seats. Very comfortable, lots of leg room, and excellent AVOD: good-sized screen, sharp resolution, and very clear sound. Lots of choices. Service at check-in and boarding very efficient. Drink service, supplying the full can of the chosen beverage. Only downside was one sour flight attendant on the return from Miami. Otherwise, attendants were helpful and cheerful. Some delays, but pilots compensated. Seven or eight pieces of luggage made it both ways, including two gate-check car seats for kids."
2629,"My recent flight from Atlanta to Washington DC required one stopover in Charlotte, which began a series of disastrous events. Mis-located luggage (had to leave CLT secured terminal area to retrieve luggage); malfunctioning electronic online boarding/check-in system; and profound and frustrating lack of American Airlines representative accountable and customer care/concern. By far the worst airline to fly. Will certainly consider these events before ever flying American Airlines again!"
2630,"My family and I flew from Milwaukee (MKE) to San Jose Del Cabo (SJD) with a connection in Phoenix (PHX). The Milwaukee flight was about 4 hours long and only a beverage service was done. The aircraft was an old US Airways plane and seat were not very comfortable. At Phoenix we had a short layover, about 1 hour 30 minutes and the flight was stopped during taxi because our gate was occupied. We got to the gate abut 30 minutes later and we basically sprinted towards our connection. The connection was done on an A321, still old interior, new livery. This flight was a little more comfortable but no beverages because of turbulence. The return flight was all on time and every thing about the same. I really hope American Airlines will improve its domestic service with free snacks on flights more the 3 hours long. Also same rule should apply to alcoholic beverages. They should improve seats, especially in economy, with IFE and make it free on longer domestic flights. My experience was not one I would love to do again, unless American improves. Hope they work hard and build something better. The one positive part was the price which was exceptional with the times and connections."
2631,"Partial review on behalf of my daughter and friend. They bought an American Airlines ticket from London Heathrow to St Thomas via Miami. They should have had two hours from touchdown in Miami to catch the connection to St Thomas. The flight from Heathrow arrived 50 minutes late. None of the American Airlines staff made any attempt to assist these two girls in making the connection. They sold them the ticket, so they must have known that they had a connecting flight, yet every enquiry they made they were told to wait. They missed the connection and eventually someone at AA did at least organise them a hotel. As I type 08.20 (US eastern) on the 3rd, they are in the departure lounge in Miami hoping for a cancellation on the midday flight to St Thomas. If they miss this, then they will not make their dream holiday, flotilla sailing holiday around the British Virgin Islands. The handling of this matter by American Airlines staff has so far been dreadful. Let's hope they pull out the stops to put right the problems caused by the late arrival of their aircraft and subsequent poor handling of customers needing to make connecting flights by their airport based staff"
2632,"Flight left on time for my trip to Toronto, however, once in the air and halfway to Toronto the pilot informed us the plane was malfunctioning and we returned to Chicago. We were directed off the aircraft and given no information for an hour as we waited. Once back on, the plane arrived 3.5 hour later than originally planned. Traveling back to Chicago, the flight was delayed for an hour. Managed to make up some time in the air, until we were taxiing into our gate and the plane braked suddenly because we hit a truck. We sat on the runway as the police and fire departments inspected the scene. As we were sitting there, I was asked to move seats by the flight attendant so he could have my seat to take pictures of the accident. About an hour later we taxied into our gate, and by that point I missed my next departure. I will never be flying American Airlines again."
2633,"Miserable experience both coming and going. Every single leg of our journey (Minneapolis to Allentown via Charlotte) was delayed. We were supposed to leave Minneapolis at 1:50 pm - actually got off the ground at 5 pm. Missed connecting flight. Stood in line for an hour to reach someone who could book us on another flight. Had to go to Harrisburg instead of Allentown! Had to cancel reserved rental car. Arrived in Harrisburg at about 2:30 am. Agent referred us to a taxi - there were no taxis! Luckily some guy in a van called a taxi service for us. Very grumpy driver finally arrived 20 mins later. Had to spend night in a hotel. Airline refused to pay because delay was due to an ""Act of God"" (ie. weather). Baggage went to Allentown, not Harrisburg. Finally got it several days later. The return home was the same. Due to leave at 5:00 - left at 5:36. Missed connecting flight. Booked on the only remaining flight leaving at 11:55 pm! Again the airline was very unapologetic and blamed it all on the weather. I will never book American Airlines again. I was initially skeptical about all the complaints I found posted about this airline. Now I know they were accurate!"
2634,"American Airlines took full advantage of a high-price round-trip ticket from LGA to CLT airports. Instead we had to fly LGA to CLT leaving NYC, and CLT to EWR returning to NYC. Yes, they had a jacked up the price by $200/ticket just to fly round-trip. If this was first class with an airline that was dependable, maybe I'd pay the price, but not when I know it's already going to be bad. I was right, it was bad. We stood online coming home from CLT, scanning our boarding passes. Some passengers sat down on the plane, we were just about to step onto the plane. Before we get one foot on, we are told there is a 1.5 hour delay. We now have to all exit the plane, un-scan our boarding passes. 40 minutes later we have to board again. Passengers were late assuming they had 1.5 hours to eat. We should have boarded the plane from the start since it took 45 minutes just to get all the passengers seated and carry-on's handled. We could've saved some time then.  I stopped flying with AA since I had options, now they merged with US Airways and I'm out of luck. Although all airlines are bad, this is the worst US airline."
2635,"My family and I had a flight to San Salvador scheduled on Dec. 16, 2015 at 1 pm. We arrived an hour earlier to turn in our luggage and receive our boarding passes but when we got to TSA we realized the guy gave us the wrong boarding passes which belonged to someone else who was going to the Dominican Republic. We went back to the man who seemed like he had no idea what he was doing because he kept asking the other person next to him for help. Once everything was taken care of we headed back to TSA and went through the process. By the time we arrived at the gate we were not allowed to enter because we were late. The lady at the desk refused to help us board another flight, instead she went to text on her phone. Another lady helped get on a flight with TACA airlines. Things got worse after that. We had to go on separate flights to Miami. I arrived at 9 pm and my mother with my 2 younger sisters arrived at 10 pm. Next we went to board our flight with TACA airlines. We had to walk across the entire airport to find TACA. Then had to wait until 3:52 am for our plane to arrive. We finally got on the plane but later we found out they were going to stop at Nicaragua for a while and from there we would arrive to San Salvador. In Boston we were told our luggage would arrive to San Salvador before we did. TACA told us the same in Miami but when we arrived to San Salvador our luggage was nowhere to be found. We received our luggage almost a week later but my bag did not arrive. I was forced to buy clothes in El Salvador because I never received my bag. I came back on Tuesday Dec. 29 2015. My bag was brought back to my home. This was the worst vacation I have ever experienced. It is also not the first time American Airlines loses my luggage. "
2636,I have been at the Orlando airport for two days waiting to pick up a friend flying in from Beijing with American Airlines. Every flight that he was supposed to get on was either cancelled or delayed. And no one from American Airlines will even tell me if he is even on a flight from Dallas to Orlando yet. How does making it impossible for people to find out what happened to their families make them safer? The guy at the counter looked annoyed even before I asked my question. This is the worst service I have ever seen.
2637,"Our trip was originally scheduled for San Francisco to Dallas Fort-Worth (Flight #2417), and Dallas Fort-Worth to Piedmont (#5812) in North Carolina. Flight from SFO to DFW departed and landed with no complications. Original leave time for flight #5812 on Sunday was to depart at approximately 8:30, to land in GSO at 11:05. Our troubles began when the gate changed from B47 to B1 with no notice or confirmation. The only reason we found out was from a non-airport flight tracker web site. Waiting at B1 with the rest of the people scheduled to take the flight, our gate was then changed again, back to B47 with no confirmation or notification from the airport. At this time the gate personnel at B1 still had no idea. The only reason we found out, again was from a non-affiliate web site. After running to the gate at the other end of the airport with 5 minutes to spare, (this because the Sky Link was broken) we made it to B47. At B47 there was no Gate attendant, only a message on the screen informing us that the flight would depart at the scheduled time. As we watched the scheduled time come and go, again with no gate attendant in sight the screen changed again with a later departure time, still no gate attendant at this time. After 2 hours a non-related flight attendant traveling with our group answered the ringing phone, to inform the control center that there was no gate attendant, no pilot, no crew, and that the plane had been sitting there since when we first arrived. About 5 minutes later the supervisor showed up. She was unresponsive to anyone’s questions, and refused to talk to anyone. She got on the phone a few times, typed in the computer and we watched the departure time change again. Only this time is was changed to 11:00, which was the same time as another scheduled flight. These people were also now at the gate and as confused as we were (because the airport flight screens said both our flights would be leaving at the same time, from the same gate). We finally got word that we were waiting on a crew, and we watched a pilot and two stewardesses board the plane. Again, no notice from any gate personnel. After we watched the now changed 11:30 departure time come and go, we watched the pilot and two stewardesses deboard the plane. Still no one at our gate to answer any questions, as the supervisor had left hours before. We asked the pilot and stewardesses what was happening and they responded that they had been sitting on the plane for too long, and were now over their hours. They also informed us once they walked away there was no one to fill their spots, and the flight would inevitably be cancelled. Again no notice from the screen that still said it was departing at 11:30, which at this time it was 12:30. I called, and they rebooked us to fly out Monday, from Dallas to Ft. Meyers, to Charlotte, then Greensboro. The woman on the phone then told me that she could not give vouchers for hotels over the phone; to go back to the attendant we first spoke with. American Airlines will never get our business. I refuse to pay thousands of dollars, and be made to feel the way we were treated. It’s one thing to be delayed due to weather, its one thing to have flights canceled, but to have your employees make us feel like pawns in your monopoly is ridiculous."
2638,"Flew Chicago to Miami with my girlfriend on Dec 2nd then on to Milano a few days later: the international flight was an Iberia ticket operated by AA which I explicitly selected as I wanted a direct flight to Milano on the way back. I have been flying with them several times in the last 5 years so I knew what to expect: basic service, aged planes and lower standards compared to major European and Asian carriers. The B738 which operated the domestic leg was kind of new instead, seats were comfortable and with a big screen (most of the services had to be paid, thoughI did enjoy the map) and crew, including the talkative pilot, nice so nothing to complain about. There was also a medical emergency on the way to Florida and it was managed promptly. MIA to MXP was operated by an old B767-300ER and, as expected, it felt like being on a bus even thought the seat is slightly better in terms of width and softness than on newer planes of any airline. Food was bad but I was prepared and I brought something with me so did not starve, it was a night flight so having no entertainment did not bother me so much but it must be painful on a daylight trip, if you are not aware. Again, crew polite and friendly but very little information from the cockpit and it was not understandable because of the bad intercom system. The only issue was the check in Miami as they force you to use the automatic machines and tag your own luggage but often you end up having to ask for help (i.e. for checking your Passport if you are not an EU citizen, like my girlfriend) and at the end the whole procedure may become slower than the standard one. The real plus of this airline is the price and I have got the feeling they are trying hard to keep their standards up to date by buying a huge number of new planes and by providing their customers a better service but it will probably take some time before they can really compete with non-US carriers in terms of quality. Personally, I will keep flying with them inside US while for overseas flights to/from USA my choice will still be for European carriers, unless unbeatable deals."
2639,"I am a frequent flier platinum member I book about 60,000 base miles (miles actually flown) on this airline a year and a fly a lot of other airlines as well. I have been an advantage member for about 20 years. I have progressively seen this airline degenerate and as of today take advantage of its customers. Customer service is almost non existent, the $200 change fee is uncalled for especially for frequent fliers. The problem is I don't think that they are trying, also I have been very keen on the price increases (sometimes close to 70% increase) brought about by the merger where now American is the only carrier to certain routes. For some reason in my experience one out of every 30 flights gets cancelled (or just my luck) for a non distinct reason, I don't want to accuse but usually I can intuitionally predict when this will happen, that is when I see that its substantially empty a week before the flight. Delays are ever more frequent, in the last three flights we had a 30 minute delay because they were still loading bags, three other delays for flight attendants not in or pilots not in yet. No snacks, and the food for purchase which is not much is usually not even available as they stock very little of it and the tempting items are taken quickly. The advantage program keeps getting changed not for the better. If the prices were cheap I would not complain as much. The few planes that have the new IFE system carry vey little media and no free tv, also the gogo in flight is really too expensive for the average passenger, if it was a reasonable rate I would use it for other than the occasional free partial pass.  Bottom line American used to be just ok, now its just subpar and expensive."
2640,"I envisioned a smooth journey, with reasonable options if any difficulties were encountered. I experienced the total opposite with my family of 4. My connecting flight from Orlando to Dallas at 6.50am was cancelled due to weather conditions which is understandable. The flight as re-booked for the same day at 3.46pm. This second flight was also cancelled last minute, and we were told that we would either be able to put on a standby for a flight 4 hours later flight or get booked for a flight two days later, the latter was clearly not an option. To my disbelief, about an hour and a half later flights began leaving for Dallas without our knowledge, it was not announced on the PA system. Eventually, we got on a flight at 10pm, but it doesn't end there, our flight to Calgary was already cancelled. The next flight from Dallas to Calgary was supposed to depart at 10.50am the next day. We did not board until 11.45am, and as the plane was getting ready to depart, one of the engines failed, resulting in the plane going out of service, and the cancellation of the flight. The only options they offered were next day flights. The service is definitely not customer oriented, they seem unwilling to meet the needs of customers during extenuating circumstances and I believe this will be my last time flying with American Airlines."
2641,"Chicago to Milan return. Lost our luggage on both the outgoing and return flights. Not staying in a hotel made it very difficult to get by without clothing, toiletries, chargers, appliances, converters etc. Spent hours every day on the phone with the airline tracking our bags. Each day they assured us that we would receive them the following day. Actually received luggage on the 5th day out. 3 days before our scheduled return I requested a change for my husband as his father had become ill while we were away. Young girls at the American Airlines kiosk in Milan spoke very little English and could only tell us that ""all flights are full"" and there was no Manager to talk to. I had a broken seat on the return that did not recline. It didn't matter that our luggage was lost again on the return because we were home. What did matter was that after contacting American Airlines about our problems, they did not even respond until the 3rd letter and then told us that it is not their policy to give any compensation for lost luggage unless we had purchased approved items and had saved all receipts. Nothing was given to us outlining these rules. "
2642,"Arrived at RDU at 0430am on the 23rd for an 05.55 departure, and 11.30am arrival to BTV. The departure flight was cancelled due to a problem with the airplane. We were rerouted to Charlotte NC for a different flight to BTV that was supposed to arrive at 23:00 that day (12 hours later than my original flight), no compensation was offered. Departing Charlotte was no better, the flight left over 3 hours late and finally reached BTV at 02:30AM on the 24th. My wife and I spent a whopping 22 hours waiting around for this airline that day. If this is the way American Airlines runs on a regular basis, forget it."
2643,"I only used American Airlines because they offered a direct flight from ORD to RDU when the others didn't. I checked through the website and saw that if I signed up for AAdvantage, I'd be allowed the first check-in baggage free. Imagine my anger when I checked in and was charged $25/bag. As I sat at the gate, I watched how other flyers had avoided the charge. Their too-large carry-ons were collected at the gate and checked-at no charge. No honest person would have thought these bags the correct size. After my arrival, I called customer service. It was a 40 minute wait. When I got through, the lady asked if I had the AAdvantage credit card. I said no. She said the baggage charges were correct, only cardholders are exempted baggage fees. This morning, I checked their website again and again. It is not easily followed. The credit card and the frequent flyer program use the same name. If you get the credit card, you are exempted the baggage fee. If you fly 20,000 miles in their program, you are exempted the baggage fee. It took plenty of clicks to piece this together. Later I discovered that the credit card requires a $3000 expenditure within its first 3 months before the flyer qualifies for the benefits."
2644,Houston to El Paso. I will never fly American Airlines again. They rescheduled my flight 3 times yesterday and assured me a flight out this morning that just got canceled and rescheduled for 2 days from now. We have driven to the airport 3 times now for canceled flights and I have missed a day of work. We have been forced to cancel and book with another airline (last minute flights are very expensive) so I can get back to work without missing another 2 days. I will drive 12 hours to get home to my family before ever flying American Airlines again. 
2645,"Killeen–Fort Hood to New York via Dallas Ft Worth. Horrible service, I will never fly this airline again. I was supposed to fly out on Dec 27th, but due to weather conditions, the airline kept pushing back the flight times. This is understandable, however the updates were coming sluggishly and unapologetically. After being in the airport since 12 for a 1.30 flight, at 4 I rebooked my flight for today at 5am. It took about 35 min for a very disgruntled worker to even attend to me while I was waiting to try and retrieve me already checked bag. At 4am I arrive at GRK, Killeen Airport and and told by the very rude, digruntled lady (from yesterday) that my 5am flight has been canceled and the next flight isn't until 12 midday. She was unapologetic and very rude. This airport predominately serves the Army community and it is sad that we are subjected to such treatment. Many of us are not afforded the opportunity to go on leave frequently or for lengthy amounts of time, so these delays are crucial. I think the service rendered by American Airlines is disheartening. I encourage anyone flying out of GRK to utilize any other carrier besides this one."
2646,"My son left Lambert Airport in St. Louis to his destination in Co Springs on Dec 26, 2015. He is an active duty soldier. He had a layover in Dallas, where the weather was horrible and his flight was delayed a couple of times and then canceled. He and a handful of other soldiers were rushed from gate to gate trying to find another flight - all were eventually canceled. The actions made by American Airlines after that is unacceptable. They were informed there were no more flights out that night. At no time were they given a blanket, pillow, food, etc. They slept on the floor of the airport. The next morning Dec 27th (Sun) they were informed they would be flown to Arkansas where they would be able to get a flight to Co Springs. In Arkansas they were informed they were actually on standby and that they probably wouldn't be able to get a flight out until Tues. My son was also informed that his flight information was lost. They would have to take personal leave time for the time spent in the airport due to a situation out of their control. They then rented a car with their own money to drive to Co Springs. At no time did American Airlines offer to refund their ticket or pay for the rental car. They also did not offer alternative solutions to staying in an airport for three days! This behavior from American Airlines is disrespectful to our military."
2647,"Diabolical from start to finish, although myself and my new partner had booked seats together we were sat apart on the outbound and inbound flight, the entertainment was unwatchable on way out as no earphones were offered and on way back it was in Spanish - although an English flight. The flight attendants refused to tell ignorant people in front to put their seats upright whilst my row tried to eat. The flight was delayed 2 hrs and gate changed twice, seats dreadfully uncomfortable. Will never fly American Airlines again."
2648,"Dallas to Vancouver with American Airlines, and this is the worst airline ever. Its ridiculous how many times the flights are cancelled and they leave the customers in standby and they don't care where will they stay overnight or anything. If your flight is cancelled they can make you wait days for next flight. The service is horrible and for them pretty much they are doing you a favour rescheduling the flights they cancel. I would put no stars this airline doesn't even deserve one star. "
2649,"As usual for any in/outbound flight to/from Brazil, boarding is slightly chaotic due to the lack of discipline of customers.  Business class seating is barely appropriate for such a new plane. Private light not working, confusing reclining commands and even worst IFE system with several unexpected resets. Apart from a boring diner and a breakfast which I would recommend anyone to stay away from at any cost, the crew is only performing routinely, smiling and extra pampering optional. It seems that their presence is strictly contained at maintaining the cabin within permissible safety standards, all other tasks being sidelined. The herringbone layout of the cabin for some reason leads to permanent knocking on the back of your head from the passenger seating behind you. Never experiernced this before in any other new business class cabins from other airlines. Overall, American Airlines delivers a mediocre service."
2650,"Lost luggage - usual lousy experience I've been flying American a lot, since unfortunately they are the only airline that will fly me from San Francisco to Montevideo. That may soon change, as I'd rather combine airlines than keep suffering the same infuriating treatment. The worst part of all is that AA has managed to once again leave one of my suitcases behind.  Last time they misplaced my bag it turned up in Uruguay 4 days after I did. This time, it's two days and counting. But that's not it. My husband had requested a vegan meal ahead of time, and on the flight they let him know they did not have one. Service is horrible. They treat you as if you had no right to request even water. If you can, combine airlines, fly through Buenos Aires, or just stay home. If I ever receive my lost bag, I'll post and update."
2651,"Memphis to Indianapolis via Charlotte. Terrible experience over Christmas Holiday weekend trying to get to wedding! Flight late and missed connecting flight stuck in Charlotte and customer service was worst of any company I have ever dealt with! Absolutely no help - couldn't find luggage, reps couldn't have cared less. I will never make the mistake of flying American again."
2652,"This may have been the lousiest first class flight I've ever flown. Hubby and I boarded an overnight flight departing Los Angeles at 10:40 pm, scheduled to arrive in Tampa at 6:15 a.m. We didn't eat in the Admirals Club at LAX because we assumed we'd be served a meal, or at least a sandwich on the flight. We boarded the plane to find a substandard first class cabin. Carry-on bags barely fit into the overhead compartments. There was no lie-flat seating. There wasn't even a pillow! Seriously, on an overnight flight - no pillow in first class? Then we found out there was no food either! American cuts off food service at 10:00 pm, which is ridiculous. We'd just flown overnight with Hawaiian Air the previous night, and they served a full dinner after take-off at 1:30am. Yet American didn't even offer the traditional snack basket. We were doled out a handful of warm nuts, and a cookie. Plan on starving with American. Speaking of no bed and no food, the third ""no"" we encountered was no entertainment. During a 5-hour flight, they didn't even offer tablets. We were totally on our own. The flight attendant did inform us that, if we happened to bring our own tablet, we could purchase movies during the flight. I kid you not - in first class they want you to buy your own entertainment. Then the dingbat flight attendant failed to turn on the cabin lights for the first half hour of the flight, so we couldn't even read our own books. We sat in total darkness twiddling our thumbs. Summing up American Airlines first class cabin on a 5-hour overnight flight, there is: No lie-flat seat No pillow, No food, No snacks, No entertainment, Extended darkness. Apparently American thinks passengers should sleep on an overnight flight, since they provide barely more than a floor for us to ride on. Unfortunately they make sleeping impossible with miserably uncomfortable accommodations. Congratulations American Airlines. You win the grand prize for lousiest first class experience worldwide. The economy cabin at a dozen small airlines around the globe is light years better than your first class."
2653,"Back at my hotel. American Airlines canceled my third connecting flight in two days (and the only flight they have to Hartford for the entire duration of Christmas Eve.) My father is driving a 12 hour round-trip from Connecticut to come pick me in Arlington, Virginia. Highlights of this morning include waiting at the airport until 15 minutes after the full flight was supposed to board when they told us all they were canceling the flight due to maintenance. Also having a American Airlines representative attempt to get belligerent with me when I leaned over to the person next to me in line and told him that he should ask for a voucher. Merry Christmas everybody."
2654,"I used to travel US Airways for over a decade. The planes were most always on time within 30 minutes. It appears that since AA has acquired US airways, myself and my family have not had a flight that was not significantly delayed by several hours including missing connections resulting in several hours of delays. My last trip was delay 2 hours at take off and they told me to check on connecting flights at the next destination. They would not even tell me before takeoff if they could book me to my destination. They had to reroute me and I was 2+ hours late. You pay a premium price for a seat and a premium price for times to fly and when they mess up the flights , you do not get comped the cost difference. I paid for upgraded seats and was assigned center aisles or back of plane next to the washroom. On the return flight that was supposed to arrive at 8PM it arrived at past midnight. One of the reasons we were so late was I heard an attendant at the desk complaining they diverted our flight crew and pilot to another flight. The last several times my wife has flown the flights have been several hours late arriving at midnight instead of 9PM. As of Today 12/23 my daughter flying in from Boston with 1 layover is now delayed 3 hours+ and the plane she was supposed to catch at 5:30 just took off 3 hours late for the stopover in Huntsville Alabama before returning to CLT to become her ride that at Best is going to be getting her in 4 hours late. AA has made travel in and out of Augusta and Columbia areas a total nightmare."
2655,"I would never like to fly on American Airlines again and would not recommend this airline. Ground staff gave me a real hard time because my name was too long and on the boarding pass etc. They told me some weird things (travel agent language) and they stopped me travelling. I had to go through so many people and hassle to keep moving. Honestly, we pay and buy the ticket and we do not enter any date on the system. If I buy the ticket from AA then it is their issue. In their case left hand doesn't know what is right hand doing. "
2656,Bought a 1 way American Airlines flight for $108 to surprise my boyfriend on Christmas Eve. Decided that I wanted to get a earlier start in the day and wanted to change my flight. There is a lack of infomation on the site so I decided to call their customer service. They were backed up on calls so I put in my number in the automated system for me to hold my place in line and not have to stay on the phone. 20 mins later I get the call the machine said that its transfering me with a lost connection! I called again put myself on the list agian to speak with someone. 20 mins later someone calls to tell me that if i wanted to change my flight to earlier in the day that it will cost me $200! The earlier flight ticket is only $136! The woman told me that I would need to cancel my flight and eat $108 and buy the new ticket for $136. I am never giving you any more of my money so I will deal with the later flight. Never again American Airlines.
2657,"London Heathrow to Albuquerque via Dallas Fort Worth. The staff at Heathrow and on the flight were helpful, seats in economy were comfortable enough (would pay for main cabin extra next time just for the leg room), and the food satisfactory for a picky vegetarian like myself. The same goes for my domestic flight to ABQ, where everything was smooth and pleasant. I had some issues on my return flight, but the staff couldn't have been better. My flight from ABQ to DFW was delayed by 2 hours, which meant I had 10 minutes to make my flight to LHR on arriving at DFW. American Airlines staff at ABQ bumped me to main cabin extra so I could be one of the first off of my domestic flight, and put me on reserve for a later to flight to LHR if I missed my designated flight. Of course, they were sceptical about my luggage making the same flight given the allotted window, but talked me through the procedure for delayed luggage.  I actually made my flight on time, and miraculously my luggage was waiting for me at LHR when I arrived. A great trip with excellent service."
2658,"What a terrible experience we had with this unresponsible airline. They cancelled our flight to Bogota when we were ready to go the airport, our original flight was 7 hours and this crazy people assigned us a flight leaving 2 days after our original day. We had to get really upset to get same day flight and traveling all around USA with our 2 kids. The worst part our baggages never came until - today is day number 3 of wearing same clothes. Hoping to get our suitcases today with the clothes and Christmas present. My advice is stay away from American Airlines. Pay a little more and have a nice vacation."
2659,"Whilst I appreciate that the vast majority of reviews are referring to domestic flights within the US, and differing factors apply, I really cannot understand the wave of negativity re AA services. From the off, these were two excellent flights, on time in both directions, easy boarding, comfortable seats, perfectly adequate food and drink for the economy cabin, and helpful, friendly staff. I like the 2-5-2 layout of this type of 777, and I see the change to 3-3-3 as a retrograde step. A large number of people travel in pairs, and it's nice to be able to sit together without having to share a row of seats. It's for that reason that, when flying economy, I try, wherever possible to choose a route served by Airbus 330 or 340. The American Airlines economy seats are wide and comfortable. The IFE is very US biased, but, of course this is an American airline. Last time I flew AA, I felt the $5 charge for drinks was ridiculous, and I'm pleased to see that they have seen the error of their ways and reverted to generous free supply of beer and wine as well as soft drinks. I'd have no hesitation using this very convenient route from N Spain to Florida (BCN to MIA) again in the future."
2660,"Los Angeles to Madrid via Dallas and service was good on American Airlines. We were too late for our initial flight, however American gave us a new LAX-DFW flight and handled our change in flight very well. We got on the plane and left. Turns out our original flight got delayed severely, so I'm glad they allowed us to change! The seats were comfortable, the flight went smoothly, however no airline is without issues. The IFE could've been better, and the food on is gross  (except breakfast and snacks.) "
2661,"American Airlines is the absolute worst airline I have ever flown. I am a 15 year old unaccompanied minor, not only were they unprofessional, they were rude, unhelpful and their flights have a habit of getting canceled. I am currently stuck in the Phoenix airport in route to Corning, New York because my connecting flight to Philly was canceled due to them being unable to find a pilot. When asked about flights I was told I had to wait until 2:45 pm today to get on a flight that is 12 hours past the time I was supposed to arrive in New York. I arrived in Phoenix from El Paso at 8 PM yesterday. It's 10 am and I've been here since I got here. They refused any hotel services and any food vouchers, my luggage is probably lost by now. I have been flying on my own for 3 years now and have never ever had a problem like this. When I asked for a Lounge they laughed at me and told me to go sleep in the lobby. Avoid this airline at all costs! Underage or not. The only thing you will get out of it is severe frustration. I am disgusted with my experience."
2662,"This was our first time taking American Airlines. My fiancé and I were flying to Vietnam. At check in, we provided all of our necessary info and errors popped up with our flight. At first we thought it was due to our passports but the airline supervisor insisted it was their system. They just couldn't find us in the system even though we had our itinerary. She couldn't provide us a clear answer as to why we had errors in our flight. It didn't make sense since we were traveling with 4 other people going to the same destination and they went through check in just fine. We stood in line with the check in agent on the phone for 2 hours! Apparently she had to call every connecting flight we were taking. All the while she barely updated us on what was going on making us ask her for updates. All we received were $100 vouchers each for American Airline tickets that had to be used within the year. We had missed our flight and they had to rebook us for the following day. Note, our original tickets were purchased online and we paid extra money to be seated together. The rebooked tickets did not have any of our seats together! We asked the agent at the gate to please sit us together and she refused. She couldn't even try to move people around? We've taken other airlines where they happily moved people around so we could sit together and succeeded. I will never take American Airlines again! So they can keep their vouchers and their terrible service! If I could give the rating a zero, I would!"
2663,"If you enjoy regularly missing your connecting flight and spending the entire day in the airport then American Airlines is for you.  Never again. On top of this customer service is garbage. I could not care less if they offer food, drinks, wifi, etc. All I ask is arrive on time, for once! If they can't fulfill this simple expectation how do you think the rest of their service is? I'll tell you, not good. Do not book with American Airlines."
2664,"Our family recently had a terrible experience with American Airlines. We had a last minute change in plans due to a terrible situation. We needed to change our Friday tickets to the next day (Saturday). The complete details of what occurred are too lengthy to include in this review, however while trying change our ticket over the phone we were quoted a price for the new ticket, after being on hold for 52 minutes (yes 52 minutes) the agent came back and told us while on hold the ticket price had gone up and she could not honor what she originally quoted. During this tragedy, American Airlines had multiple opportunities to extend a tiny of gesture goodwill, that would have cost them nothing but would have helped us tremendously. But no it was a total win/lose situation."
2665,"My family of nine flew American Airlines from Memphis to Harrisburg in November. There were five children and four adults, which one was with handicap. The treatment my family received was out of this world. Traveling during the holidays is always hard, but all services were great. As the father of this family, I just want let you know how thankful I am for making our holiday traveling so wonderful."
2666,"My previous experiences with American Airlines was not so good, but this one flight compensated it all. The flight attendants were well dressed, friendly, and professional. I heard food on American Airlines is expensive, but I still bought the Asian Chicken Wrap and it was worth the price I paid. Before touching down at LA I got sick, and somehow managed to walk to the galley and despite her restriction, the flight attendant managed to get me a bottle of water and I am grateful to her for that. The flight was 3/4 full, so I went to the two empty seats at the back and rested all the way to LA, the seats were comfortable, and the plane seemed new though some seats were worn and torn. I am still not sure if I may fly this airline again because of how bad the experiences were, of the 4 flights I had with American, this one was the only one which was satisfactory."
2667,"We were flying to Punta Cana DR via a flight from Detroit MI to Philadelphia PA and then direct to Punta Cana. Plane sat at gate for 2 hours prior to leaving Detroit. Pilot showed up 10 minutes before flight time, as the plane had been delayed twice already. Started boarding and pilot said they had a bad switch and everyone got off. Since we were connecting with only 1 hour to spare, I asked for the desk at the gate to please contact Philadelphia and make sure they know we are delayed. I was told several times that there would be not issues on the connecting flight. When we arrived in Philadelphia at the departure gate with only 5 minutes to spare, we then found out that the ""direct flight"" to Punta Cana left 25 minutes early? How does an airline leave early when they still had 8 people to board the flight? We lost one entire day and night at the resort. I have flown American many times before with basically the same results over the last 20 years."
2668,Will not be flying American again if I can help it! I paid an upgrade thinking I could board first. It was a complete waste of money for the upgrade. Then can you believe they want to charge you deny where from $11 to $65 to get a decent seat on each flight! That is after you pay for your flight. Couldn't even manage to sit with the person I purchased a ticket with. Now you must also pay for food. And on and on all these hidden fees. And if you cancel your flight it's $200.  Southwest gives you a credit for your next flight! Doesn't charge for seating or your first bag. So long American - Southwest from now on.
2669,"On both our flights to Punta Cana and our return flight with American Airlines we experienced delays and food shortages on the plane - as in there was very little food stocked on the plane and it ran out completely before our seats were reached. Flying from or into Punta Cana, this means that we had many hours without food and with very little to drink as one is not allowed to pack anything to bring through TSA. To compound that when the Manchester flight was canceled due to fog we were left with no time to get any food either. The saving grace was that the flight attendants largely are very kind (save a few). I felt the booking procedure was deceptive as I did not know there would be additional charge for better seats when I purchased tickets. I will attempt to avoid this airline in the future."
2670,New York JFK to Paris CDG with American Airlines. Newer airplane thus the fully reclining seats were quite comfortable. Service was acceptable and the flight attendant was very accommodating. I was able to sleep most of my flight without disturbance from the staff. Bathrooms were clean. Would fly with American Airlines again.
2671,"I previously travelled on this route prior to the take over of US Airways by American Airlines. I felt that although the flight from MAN to TPA via PHL was well priced, it had a rather a low-cost feel to it. Food was very poor as expected. There were very few drink runs and the crew as usual on American were all quite a bit older. However the A330 was in good condition, the seats were comfortable and the IFE worked. Internal flights both ways were 100% capacity but again were on time. I would definately use AA on this route as PHL was particularly impressive as a US entry point."
2672,"As a college student that was studying abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina and it being time to go home I was nervous that something would happen on my American Airlines return journey as I was faced with a 14 hour delay on my way there. We board the plane in Buenos Aires and was delayed because of an ill passenger who turned out was drunk. And I was getting nervous because I had to go through passport control and customs and catch my connecting flight in Miami. After getting through customs in Miami I was told that I missed my connecting flight. The only way I could make it to my final destination that wasn't in the middle of the night was to take a train to the Ft. Lauderdale airport and catch a flight to Charlotte, N.C. that would connect me to Columbus, Ohio. I went to Ft. Lauderdale and got to the counter to check in my luggage and stood at the counter for 10 minutes and the people working there just ignored me by talking among themselves or playing on their computers causing me to miss the flight to Charlotte. Finally when someone paid attention to me they were very unapologetic and I demanded either a refund or to be put on a flight that connected with Columbus ASAP. They got me on a flight to Philadelphia that connected to Columbus and thankfully I those flights ran smoothly and on time. I sent an email to AA's customer service explaining to them why I will never be using American Airlines again. I will look into a different airline for international travel and use Southwest for domestic travel. The way they treat the people who pay money to fly on their planes is atrocious and I am surprised that they are still in business. Nobody deserves to be treated like how they treated me for something that was completely their fault."
2673,"I have accepted the fact that ""legacy"" carriers in the United States are nothing more than low frills, low service, nickle and diming, budget airlines without the budget price. At least American is. Fortunately for me, and the only reason I made this trip was the fare was extremely low. American Airlines charges for everything. Want to sit in the middle of the plane, thats extra. Want to watch anything on the brand new IFE devices, thats extra. Checking bags? Extra. Needless to say on this flight, the first leg was on a nearly new A321. If it was in service much more than a month I would be surprised. The flight left on time and arrived into LAX a few minutes early. One thing I can say, and I do not know if it was because the plane was new, or this particular model is outstanding, but the cabin pressurization was amazing. I had no effects at all from the flight to my normally very sensitive ears. On the return, the flight also left on time and arrived into Miami a few minutes early. I had no issues that needed dealing with, and the flight crew were all friendly. My issue with American is the fact that everything is extra. Fuel prices are at a record low, airline profits are at record highs, yet none of that has been invested into the flying experience in the form of reduced fees, or increased amenities."
2674,"I was returning home from Phoenix to Long Beach this morning (8.45am flight) with American Airlines. I had priority boarding, and as I approached the flight attendant at the door, he said I would have to check my luggage because it wouldn’t fit in the overhead bin. I’m sure I had a puzzled look and was shaking my head with confusion because I was able to fit it on my previous fit in the same plane configuration. I didn’t argue with him or say a thing, but it didn’t seem right. I get to my seat, I paid an additional $25 for the extra room on an Exit aisle, and there’s a bag under the seat in front of me (where my carry-on should go). I thought maybe a previous passenger had mistakenly left it behind. So I waited until most everyone had taken their seat, and hit the Attendant light. I could see the attendant (the same one that made me check my bag) look from the front cabin to see where the light was on, and when he saw it was above me, he just rolled his eyes. Then, a couple of minutes, from behind me I hear a gruff and bothered female voice; “Do you need something?” I explained that there was a bag in front of me and that I was concerned that someone had left it by mistake. She said in the same, bothered and unfriendly voice, “That’s a crew member’s bag. Just leave it, it’s fine where it is.” During the entire time pre-flight and flight, I never saw her smile or say a pleasant thing to anyone in the main cabin. Instead of asking, “Would you like some orange juice or some coffee?”, it was “What do you want?” It’s as if we were bothering her and why did we have to be on her plane? Finally, as I was walking off the plane, the front cabin attendant was wishing those in front of me a good day, but when I walked up, he just looked at me with a dead expression. He didn’t acknowledge me at all. It’s been a while since I’ve flown AA, and I don’t remember having an unpleasant experience before. Based on this experience, from both crew members, I will avoid AA for any future flights. AA needs to do some people skills training, as there are other choices for travelers. PS – the attendants on my outbound flight were pleasant and helpful. This review is for the return flight only – but it’s left a much bigger, and negative impression on me."
2675,"My family and I flew from Philly to Phoenix to Orange County with American Airlines. All our flights were on time and we made it safely to our destinations. That's the best I can say about our latest trip with this airline. The customer service and attention to the customers needs and comfort is non-existent. Their website is the worst for checking in, there is no onboard entertainment. On four different flights the wifi and entertainment site didn't work. The flight attendants and crew just go through the motions with minimal effort and care. This airline is on par with the service and comfort of a municipal bus service."
2676,Charleston to Boston via Washington with American Airlines. This is the worst airline I have ever flown with. Missed my first connecting flight due to fog over airport. Get re directed to another flight 2 hours later and get to the gate 10 mins before departure and little tough guy tells us that we are to late and missed our flight when I was looking at our airplane. Then ther redirect us to another flight an hour later. Board that plane and wait for another hour only to be told that plane is out of order to and to unload that plane and on to another. When I was supped to be in Boston at 12 noon I am writing this review at 4 o'clock and still not even on a plane to Boston. Worst customer service. 
2677,"Terrible service for the elderly. I purchased a ticket for my Mother to fly from Pittsburgh to Columbia with a stop in Charlotte. This was a 90th birthday surprise party for her. When she arrived at the gate escorted by my niece, she was informed that she could not carry on her luggage. This was because no American Airlines employee would be willing to lift her carry on case to the overhead bin. Her carry on case was within the size required for carry on, however, would not fit under the seat. My 90 year old mother is unable to lift items above her head. My niece was not permitted to enter the cabin of the aircraft to lift the carry on for her. My mother takes a variety on medications and could not risk the chance of losing her luggage in the stowed compartment of the aircraft. After extreme anxiety, my niece was able to purchase a $100 piece of luggage that would fit under the seat and would hold all of her things. Her case was not heavy or even filled. I contacted American Airlines customer service. After a month, American Airlines gave her a $50 flight coupon for her inconvenience. What a joke! My Mother was so shook up and was unable to enjoy her travel and her stay with us. Elderly people cannot deal with this type of issue. I do not recommend American Airlines for anyone that may require assistance of any type. American Airlines does not care about it's customers or their welfare."
2678,"I fly a lot through out the year but I have to say American Airlines has the worst customer service I have ever seen. I fly first class and have never had the worst service and attitudes I had on this flight, plus the plane left 45 mins late and made us miss our connecting flight which I was at the gate 5 mins before departure and they already left. Customer service was horrible and they gave me a $24 meal voucher for the inconvenience!  American you need to fly different airlines and take note of customer service from all ends."
2679,"Denver to London via Chicago with American Airlines. Our flight from Denver to Chicago was delayed due to weather. That's understandable. The delay caused us to miss our originally scheduled flight from Chicago to London, so I waited in line at the gate counter to re-book on a later flight from Chicago to London that we'd be able to make, based on the delay. Several of us on the flight were attempting to connect to London, and the later flight was filling up fast. Luckily I was near the front of the line. And then the gate agent upped and disappeared on us. Just walked away without saying anything to the person at the front of the queue. We thought we'd gone to the restroom or something and would be back. No - gone. The other agent didn't appear to notice or care when we pointed out this ridiculous behavior. After queuing back up at the end of the other line and finally getting some service, the later flight was full, of course. Delayed our vacation by a day and a half. No compensation. The flights themselves were OK, once we were actually on some flights. But I'll pay more to avoid American in the future. Too many awful customer service experiences with them."
2680,"In 40 years I have never had an experience with any airline as negative as I had with American Airlines. Had to fly out on the first flight of the day so I could drive a moving truck to the location where it was to be packed. Stayed in a hotel the night before my flight to make sure I would be there on time. Woke up at 4 am and got to the airport by 5 am. Flight boarded at 6 and they kept us sitting on the runway for 2 and a half hours with no explanation or eta. Flight attendants were extremely rude, telling customers to be quiet and to stop asking questions. Ended up paying the moving crew for three hours to sit around, paid for a hotel the night before my flight and had to stay an additional night in a hotel because it was too late to complete the drive on the anticipated day. Contacted corporate and was given an insincere apology. Not sure I'd fly American in the future and did not expect them to compensate me for the money wasted but a travel voucher is the least they could have done. My guess is that this is business as usual for them."
2681,"Miami to St. Kitts on American Airlines. All was great until we all were boarded and soon found out we were waiting for a few individuals to board. We then found out we were delayed on runway for weather. Then the next announcement said if we didn't leave at a certain time we would be brought back to the gate due to the pilots being over their hours. We eventually made it back to the gate, the announcement was they were trying to find a back up crew to fly us out then we found out we had a crew but then the airport was shutdown at our final destination. We all got off plane and were specifically told our flight was cancelled and to see the rebooting station for a hotel voucher and food voucher. The food and hotel voucher was a no go as they ""delayed"" our flight and forced us all to stay in the airport with not a thing but a rocking chair and airport seats. The airport completely shut down leaving 200+ individuals stranded with no food/drink etc. Never was an attempt to let anyone know what was going on or our next step. The customer service is the worst I have seen and you just lost at least if not more 6 customers who will never use your services again."
2682,"Louisville to Miami via Charlotte on American Airlines. The plane had a fuel pump issue, it was an hour late at take off. When I asked one of the flight attentants how long it would take to reach Charlotte,  she rudely asked what did they say during the announcement. I replied that I had hearing issues and did not recall. I felt that this was an inappropriate response to a person with a handicap. For the sake of the airline and the other people traveling with this flight attentant I hope her demeanor and behavior is corrected. "
2683,"We had a 5:15am American Airlines flight from Pittsburgh to San Juan via Philadelphia. We checked the flight status at 3:00 am and again upon arrival at airport at 3:45AM. Airport boards stated ""on-time"". Since it was taking an inordinate amount of time for the agent to check baggage (10 minutes) we asked why. She stated the flight was cancelled and she was attempting to re-book. (We later learned the flight was actually cancelled much earlier the preceding evening, but no notification from American Airlines.) The only option offered would arrive assuming an on-time arrival with insufficient time to arrive at the port before our cruise departed. While waiting for the AA agent, we found a Southwest flight that would arrive in San Juan much earlier. The Agent refused to re-book on Southwest stating the American Airlines does not use Southwest for re-booking. We went down the hall to the Southwest counter and were able to get on the Southwest flights at our own considerable expense (a great flight experience). Our return trip via American Airlines was also cancelled, but the San Juan agent was able to re-book on United. We have now been attempting for over a month, to get a refund for our cancelled outbound trip with no success. Although the customer service representatives are very pleasant and seem to understand the situation, they apparently are unable to get our refund request approved. Unfortunately it appears that American Airlines has adopted USAirways tradition for uncaring service and lack of respect for their passengers. We will never book on AA again."
2684,My American Airlines flight from London to NYC was suddenly delayed by a few hours and I only received the notification at the counter when I arrived at the airport. While I checked in online beforehand already and American Airlines had my contact details. The lady responded as it was the most common thing!  Yesterday I was not able to go on my AA 0106 flight as I was 2 minutes late to get my label for my check in luggage at the automated machine. I ran around and all staff refused to assist me. The traffic took more than 3 times longer to arrive at the airport so I already felt stressed due to that - thanks for deserting me. What I'm furious about is the the flight left 1 hour and 35 minutes later. Rebooking the ticket was not possible and I had to contact the agency. Worst experience and no customer service at all.
2685,"I was a very happy customer on my American Airlines flight AA39 from London Heathrow to Miami on 28th November. A great product on their Boeing 777-300,  seats and entertainment. The service onboard was excellent. Food was good, plentiful and well-presented, good choice of wines. We fly to the US a couple of times a year in business and this is our second time with American Airlines. It won't be our last."
2686,"American Airlines from Los Angeles to New York, and I was pleasantly surprised. FAs were professional and friendly. Food options were great. Cabin was impeccable and seats comfortable. I didn't use the IFE so cannot comment. Overall it was a great flying experience and I'd gladly fly American Airlines again."
2687,"Atlanta to Albuquerque via Phoenix. I was supposed to board my connecting American Airlines flight at midnight to Albuquerque. Just 20 min before boarding the flight was cancelled not due to technical snag nor bad weather. I was taken by surprise to hear that their crew member hasn't turned for duty. I was told to take a connecting flight to Dallas, with a first class upgrade which again turned out to be a second class ticket. The airline service was disgusting. It was a bad thanksgiving vacation. "
2688,"I flew American Airlines from Charleston, SC to Hartford, CT with a connection in Washington D.C. Once I arrived in DC we were told the plane would be delayed 2 hours (originally supposed to leave at 10:10pm) to 12:01am due to maintenance problems with our plane coming from Portland, ME. Once the plane arrived at 11:45 they rushed us all onboard and then sat there for 40 minutes on the tarmac. Finally the captain came on and said due to more ""maintenance issues"" (but never specified) that they were ""trying to decide"" what to do - either switch us to a whole other plane or call to repair it. After about another 40 minutes of sitting a few of us starting to receive emails that the flight had been canceled all together. It is sad how Orbitz sent me an email quicker than they could tell me! After a 2 hour delay and 1.5 hours on the plane they finally canceled. But it gets better! With 70 of us and 1 woman at the service desk (who was very nice and trying her best!) we were told the only options were to wait until 11pm the next day (almost a full 24 hours) for a direct flight or take a flight to Chicago and have a 6 hour layover until Hartford. Due to myself being a clinician I could not afford to miss that much time, so I ended up taking a flight to White Plains, NY and drove myself to Hartford with a rented car! I wouldn't say I'm a frequent flyer, but I do fly a few times a year, and coincidently this was my first time flying American and also my worst experience ever! The flight crew had a ""don't care"" attitude and were not accommodating at all. The gentlemen next to me, after being on the plane for an hour, asked for some water to which she replied ""I'll have to ask the captain, but I can't be getting everyone beverages"" - surprise he never got the water, and when the captain came on the first time he said ""Sorry everyone for the slight delay in getting you out."" 3 hours isn't a slight delay! I can understand trying to be humorous but at 1 in the morning when we all have lives to get back to it came off as just crude! I get that everyone, especially the crew, is tired. But it is times like that where the customers need some extra care and accommodation - every little thing helps! In the future I will try everything in my power not to fly American Airlines!"
2689,"Atlanta to Puerto Plate via Miami. I went to buy tickets online and I thought twice about flying with American Airlines because every time I've flown them the experience has been dreadful. Flight delays, cancellations, horrible customer service. Besides my good judgement, I purchased 5 tickets with them. Almost immediately I realized I had made the purchase in error and called to get a refund, which I'm entitled to. I was put on hold forever, disconnected multiple times and told there would be no refund. They must be desperate for money if they have to act contrary to other airlines. "
2690,"I have never had such a bad experience on a plane in my life. I was coming back to Atlanta from the Bahamas with American Airlines but I had a connecting flight through Miami. Getting onto the plane they made me check my carry-on because they had reached capacity (even though I was in the second group). I was hesitant doing so but I did as they asked. When we landed I waited for an hour and half in baggage claim before they told me where it was. They had left the bag in Miami because the plane was too heavy and couldn't carry anymore bags. (They didn't even tell me they were doing this.) The worst part was that I was going to the Auburn Alabama game in the morning and my ticket was in that bag so I had to miss the game. Also the rest of my family's bags were scuffed, one of the bags had the zipper ripped off and the pocket in the front ripped off as well. They asked if American Airlines would fix it or replace it and they refused to do either. The fact that I am actually taking the time to write this review is how angry I am. I will never fly this airline again. "
2691,"Very expensive to fly with American Airlines. We purchased our tickets in errror on line and they would not reimburse once they have your money. When they mess up too bad the customer pays and they say they are not responsible for any additional costs incurred. Their plane had problems which delayed our take off for four hours. The terminal staff were rude and arrogant. Their problems caused us to miss our connecting flight and our hotel transfer. We had to pay to regain both and they are not willing to reimburse because it is not there problem. They said they would send me a voucher to travel with them again, but after reading the reviews from others, I don't think flying with American Airlines will be happening again"
2692,"American Airlines always disappoints. Every time I flew with them my flight either gets cancelled or delayed. Last time I flew my flight got cancelled leaving La Guardia, NY at around 3pm because it was raining and they only booked another flight the next day out of Newark which miles away (in NJ)! Not to mention that it stopped raining about an hour later. Today my flight got delayed for an hour because of a ""maintenance issue"". I am yet to see a flight with this airline that does not give me any issues or headaches. Such a disappointing and non-reliable service. If I could give a negative rating on this website I definitely would."
2693,"Was due to fly to JFK with AA today but flight got cancelled after much misinformation given out by AA staff what ensued after the cancellation announcement was beyond shambolic with the staff employed by this pitiful excuse of an airline doing a runner and not one member of staff to be found on the abandoned ""customer service"" desks, every other airline in Terminal 3 had a desk open but not AA, trying to get through to the number given out by the staff in the departure lounge was impossible and in the end it was helpful staff at the British Airways section who managed to get some information for passengers. The contempt that AA obviously has for its customers was quite an eye opener with not one ounce of customer service or care given at all, many of the passengers were Americans trying to get home to family for Thanksgiving. Whilst we all understand mechanical issues have to be dealt with and safety being paramount, you also need to have some level of empathy and a duty of care for your customers and there was a way AA could have dealt with a cancelled flight but they failed big time. Also listening to staff whispering and  discussing ongoing maintenance issues with this aircraft does not instill confidence. I will not give this airline another chance. Never again."
2694,"I contacted American Airlines to upgrade to business. Agent told me I would have to purchase 5000 miles which I did. She gave me a record locator number and seats. When I got to airport I was told I would need 600 dollars more,  that I didn't have enough miles, and had to re issue coach ticket. When I returned to the US I contacted American Airlines to refund purchased miles and was told by a very rude condescending person that it would not be refunded. I am canceling my American Airlines credit card and will never fly with them again. BewAre of agents that tell you to get you to purchase non Refundable miles."
2695,"Overall an interesting travel experience with American Airlines. First time with them on medium haul across the Atlantic. Amazing IFE on-board the Boeing 777 for this flight from London to New York JFK. Food options limited and if you are a vegetarian, there is only an option for a vegan meal. Space and toilets satisfactory. Terminal 3 at Heathrow busy and long queues. Seat to seat calls are available besides WIFI access onboard with a minimal charge of course. Overall good and may fly with them again."
2696,"My trip started off a little rocky. Understandably, my flight was originally delayed two hours due to a passenger being sick. From there, bad weather caused my flight to be detoured and grounded in Kansas for 1+ hours before resuming the flight to Texas. During this entire flight time, we were only served drinks once (at the very beginning of the flight), and the flight was short on food due to the previous delay due to sickness. Therefore us passengers went 7+ hours with only one beverage service, and no available food. When we landed, we were all scrambling to reach our connecting delayed flights, if they hadn't been cancelled at that point yet. Luckily, I reached my gate in time, waited an hour, before realizing people were slowly disappearing even though there had been no announcement stating my flight had been cancelled (this was at 12AM). After inquiring if my flight was in fact cancelled, I was also told that every single flight to my destination was booked the next day with no openings on any flights for over a day. Desperate, I asked how I could get closer to my destination. I was put on standby for a 1:30AM flight out, and told I could take a 2 hour bus ride to my destination in the morning. Once again, upon landing at 2:30 in the morning, we were left unable to unload for one hour because flights were backed up. I get that weather happens, but the customer service to this point was terrible, and we never once receiving anything to drink. Once when I landed, I figured I should find out where my bus would be leaving from before finding a spot on the floor to close my eyes for a few hours. I was told by an airport worker I was in the right location, so I stopped my search and found my place on the floor. Waking up an hour and fifteen minutes early, just to be sure I wasn't given the wrong information, I began questioning where this bus would exactly turn up. After talking to 5 different people and being told 5 different places I should go to catch my bus, an American Airlines employee sent me all the way across the airport to a place where my bus was not taking off from, and no one could answer any of my questions. So, I returned to American Airlines, and finally my patience was spent. I explained my story, showed them my tickets, and the employee replied that in the ten years that they had worked there, they had never seen this bus ticket option before. Then after spending ten minutes making phone calls, they realized this bus service had in fact been around for 2 years. Never once did I receive an apology for being sent all around the airport, when this could've been solved by admitting they were unsure where this bus left from and making a phone call to find out the answer. I then had a 4 hour layover at the airport, before finally boarding a bus to my final destination. Arriving 17 hours later than I should have. I understand that we can't control the weather, and things happen. My issue with this experience was the awful customer service. I would have difficultly recommending flying with American Airlines due to my experience."
2697,"First class cabin was dark and dingy, the seat was stained and scratched, had been very poorly cleaned and the carpet smelt. Welcome drink was served in a plastic cup. Catering was truly insulting, comprising some warm nuts followed by a bowl containing 4 small pieces of processed cheese and 2 crackers. Cabin crew were friendly enough. AA, you should be truly ashamed."
2698,"In Orlando my plane had mechanical problems so we were over an hour late leaving, which then made me miss my connecting flight. This happens and I understand that. However, the way I was treated in Philly was inexcusable and the compensation was worse! First after missing my connecting flight I was told to go to Customer Service, which was a very long walk. Then there was a line with over 100 people in it, so I had to stand in line for well over 90 minutes, late at night. By 11pm, I was given a ticket for the next morning flight, no apology and no hotel. I was supposed to sleep in the airport. They would not even help me find a hotel, they gave me a phone number, in which I had to walk to a second customer service desk to use their phone and they couldn't even tell me a hotel close by to use. I called the phone number for hotels, but the quota for airline hotels was booked up by this time and I was left on my own to find a hotel, book it and pay for it. I have a disability, and I asked for a cart to help me through the airport, I was denied. The ticket girl, told me it wasn't that far to walk. Yes, it was! I ended up googling hotel, found one close by and got my own transportation to it. Caught my flight the next morning. When I called Customer Service and complained they reimbursed me less than half the cost of my hotel and gave me reward points that are useless. "
2699,"I paid extra to have a short flight due to traveling international with a 2 month old infant. I arrived at the airport 2.5 hours before. They insisted I do self check which didn't work. The next attendant couldn't help so they took me to another after 1.25 hour of check in. The security took over an hour as well and I arrived 10 minutes before departure but they had closed the gate! The attendant was very rude and said my only option was to stay the night or leave on a later flight 13 hours later and travel all night, she did not seem to care at all that I had an infant. A different individual ""magically"" found me a flight 2 hours later and she seemed annoyed. I ended up having an 11 hour overlay with an infant when I was originally supposed to have a 2.5 hour overlay and paid $400 extra. They weren't supposed to check my bag, it was supposed to be Gate check with my stroller and carseat, but they ended up checking it at my first flight so I was without baby cloths, diapers, and formula. When I talked to a flight manager he said there was nothing they could do and didn't seem to care I had a screaming infant. "
2700,"Chicago to Manhattan Regional. My experience with American Airlines was tumultuous and stressful. After a long 4 hour delay, the airline decided to give up on any further attempts of getting us to our desired destinations.  The error that occurred was not because of the weather, but ill-preparation from the flight crew. We were not accommodated in any way after the delay and cancellation, causing a loss of money. Our purchase or game tickets, hotel stays, rental cars, and even keeping our dog in a kennel at home became a huge waste of money, and all we got from the company was a simple, ""sorry."" Would not recommend this impolite and disrespectful airline."
2701,"Having flown all over the country and flown all over the world, I have a bit of an idea of what a quality flying experience is, as well as what a bad experience is. My wife and our two toddlers had to get a flight out of San Diego to Salt Lake City via Los Angeles. She got to the airport with plenty of time, but being a Friday evening, the airport was packed. She went to check in at the kiosk, but it denied her and she had to wait in a long line to see a rep. Finally, she got to the front of the line, only to be told that she needed to go wait in another line because the counter she waited for was being closed. With two toddlers, who, thank the lord, were very well-behaved, a carry-on suitcase, and a stroller, she had to get into another line to wait all over again. By this time, her departure was getting close and she had not even gotten her ticket due to the kiosk denying her (for whatever reason) and being sent to wait again in another line. When she finally got to the ticket counter (again) the female rep told my wife that it was a waste of time to print her ticket as my wife and kids would surely miss the flight. There was still time to make the flight, but the time was running out quickly. Having no sense of courtesy, the rep began to close down her counter and handed out cards with a phone number that people would have to call to have their tickets printed. I have never seen or heard of that before. After more time was wasted at the counter, my wife began to panic, and while trying to keep my two toddlers calm, she finally convinced the rep to print her ticket. My wife rushed through security (of course having her hands inspected for whatever residue the TSA looks for), and got to the gate. The airplane was still docked, but the door was closed, thus she was denied boarding. My wife went around to a few different American Airlines desks to figure out what she could do and wasn't helped at all, rather, she was greeted with agitation, not sympathy or civility. Eventually, Alaska Airlines allowed her onto their next flight free of charge, which was a direct flight, and she made it home. However, she had to wait another several hours in the San Diego terminal with two toddlers to get onto that flight. American Airlines and their reps made my wife and two young kids miss their flight and couldn't care less. Alaska Airlines solved our crisis and didn't even charge us. Now I have my first airline credit card and it is from Alaska Airlines, as I refuse to fly with any other national airline anymore."
2702,"New York JFK to Bogota via Miami with American Airlines, and a good experience. Transit in Miami is a pleasure, since terminal D is easy to walk, and nice shopping and eating experience. Admirals Club always crowded but comfortable. All flights on time. Nice FA and IFE offered on all legs. The new A321 is comfy and quiet. Even on my way back the gave me a shorter connection than originaly planned, got back to JFK sooner than expected."
2703,"I used to like American Airlines overall, but vowed to never fly US Airways after 100% horrible experiences. The merger now has the American name and logo but the US Airways utter contempt of its customers. I had gotten tied up with horrible security lines and despite checking in from home, arriving an hour early, I got to the gate at 8 minutes till. So the plane is there just sitting. No break for me. I go to customer service. The first agent said she would reroute me through Dallas but the plane was full, so I got a standby for 11hours later. I looked online and saw there were seats for another flight through Chicago and went back to request that, only arriving 3 hours late. This bored agent (not harried, there order for agents and me) said that their policy now was to when we re route through the same exact points so I was stuck on the next direct flight and could not be rerouted.  But either way one of them was lying through to me. The 2nd agent refused to fly me on the much more convenient flight she just said deadpan, ""welcome to the new American Airlines."" At least I am making my flight on the much later one on a rickety old US Airways plane which are prone to frequent breakdowns, which is why I refused to fly them before. 4-6 hour delays were too common. I can always hope for a upgrade to first class, however on these planes, the first class on domestic flights is like 1985 economy deluxe. The whole experience of having to sit in an airport simply because the agents refused to help reminds me of why I could never fly US Airways. It looks like I will have to abandon American Airlines as well in favor of someone cares about its customers. At least a little bit."
2704,"American Airlines is the absolute worst, an old Boeing 737 took us from Los Angeles to Miami, and in between anyone accustomed to this route knows the type of turbulence. The issue here is not the turbulence, but the fact an old plane was chosen for this route. The flight attendants have an 'I couldn't care less' attitude, and are so badly dressed. It baffles me that they don't have complimentary meals on a 5 hour long flight. The seat was really uncomfortable, and the leg room was not pleasing. After having a 10 hour flight from Fiji to LA, and an 11 hour long transit, I was expecting this airline to be nice and comfortable so I can sleep, but I couldn't. I will avoid this airline at all costs in future."
2705,"When I booked what I thought was first class for my husband and me, I realized it was economy so I rebooked into first class. I received 2 E-itinerary with with the same record locator. One had my husband going from Jacksonville to Dallas Ft Worth and the other on a different date but same record locator had me going from Charlotte to Des Moines with another person and charged to my C/C. After many calls and hangups from agents, the tickets were corrected. They said this never happens! Then I noticed I had been charged for three reservations. I called and spoke with at least 10 American Airlines' representatives. Most would put me on hold until I got a dial tone. I thought I will never fly AA again. Today one week later I spoke with a supervisor, and she not only explained about my refund on my credit card but was so courteous that my blood pressure went way down and my opinion of American Airlines went back to A1. I will continue to fly AA only because of her."
2706,"I was very impressed by the extra service from all airline staff. I was on crutches with a broken foot and they offered to take me in a wheelchair between airlines and even to get my luggage. All airline staff was very courteous and concerned. However, I was very very offended at the end of the journey by a porter. The lady who took me to get my luggage realized that she couldn't carry my bag outside and wheel me as well, so she asked a porter to help, a Spanish speaking man. He literally picked up the one suitcase and wheeled it outside. The lady left me in the wheelchair to wait for my ride. The porter then turned to me and said, ""well?"" ""Well what?"" I asked. ""I work for tip!"" He said. ""I'm sorry I have no cash,"" I said. ""Ha! You have no cash?? I work for tip!"" He said again. ""Leave me alone,"" I said. He then threw my suitcase on the ground and walked away. At this point it was midnight, my foot was in real pain and I was really offended by this. I have no problem tipping porters, but this was a very different situation, as I didn't not ask for his help and it literally only took a moment of his time. The lady could not have taken me outside without his assistance. I will avoid the airline after this experience."
2707,"I have flown American Airlines at least 5 times this year, not one of the 5 times has anything gone smoothly, from delayed flights due to planes not being available, planes breaking down on runways, switching planes and gates multiple times, and the list goes on. The staff is flat out rude, every single time I have a question it is responded with a condescending answer. By far the worst airline I have ever flown and this includes American eagle. If this is any indication of how irate I have become with them, I have never written a review online for any business no matter how bad the customer service was. I recommend you choose any other airline besides American or consider driving. With all the delays you will undoubtedly incure you may make better time driving."
2708,"Los Angeles to Kona (Hawaii) on an American Airlines A321. Now that I've taken two flights on this new aircraft and spoken to flight attendants it is clear that American has chosen the wrong aircraft for this route. Firstly, although new, the setup is so flawed and poorly thought out on many levels. The entertainment system is problematic with constant reboots needed and a very clumsy operating system. The whole experience is like renting a car from a budget company and getting a new car which is clearly made as cheaply as possible. The most serious issue is that due to fuel requirements this aircraft very often has to move passengers away from the front of the aircraft when loads are light. A flight attendant confessed to me that it happens with regularity including evacuation of the entire first class cabin. This is not a safety issue but an issue of very poorly thought out choice of aircraft for route. That combined with the serious design flaws make it a strange experience."
2709,"This is the first and last time I book a flight with American Airlines. The pilot for the 6am flight was a no show, which resulted in a late departure to Philadelphia where I needed to connect to get to Syracuse. They made me miss my connecting flight to Syracuse. They provided me with a rescheduled ticket for 2pm to make up for it. They wait until 2pm to tell me that I had a standby ticket meaning that I was not guaranteed a seat. It's 12 hours later and I'm currently and still at the airport because of this standby! Never again will I invest in disorganization and lack of good quality service."
2710,"Decided to fly with American Airlines for a return trip from Houston to Phoenix. This was a colossal mistake! We arrived at the airport 2hrs before our flight and almost didn't make it. We tried checking in at the American kiosk but were told we had to see a representative because we were travelling with a small dog. We got in line for a rep and waited while several angry customers ahead of us were seen to. Got to the front of the line and were told that we could not be helped and had to stand in another line for a different rep that could check our little dog in. We did this and finally 30 mins later were at the front of that line when the rep closed his station! He directed us to another line where we waited and started to fret because it was getting near to our flight time. Got to the front of that line and the sloth like rep told us our gate had closed. We asked what our options were and were told it was not her problem! My husband ran and tracked down an AA manager. He proceeded to read us the riot act about being late before even hearing our side of the story. Fortunately some other travellers who were going through similar scenarios stood up for us and told the AA manager that we had indeed been on time and had spent over 1.5hrs in the check in line. The manager decided to help us after explaining AA was in no way responsible for any of our trouble. He got us to our gate just before the plane door closed. We had paid for an upgraded seat but lost that with no compensation and not even an apology. Our luggage did not make our flight and we were told in Phoenix it would cost us to have it delivered to where we were staying! We received similar treatment on our trip home but had allowed 2 extra hours at the airport so made our flight! I have never seen so many angry disgruntled travelers on an airline and I travel a lot. Nor have I seen so many rude, incompetent employees. I would ride my bike to a destination before I would ever take another American Airlines flight!"
2711,"Complete distain for their customers. Although American Airlines tout in their Customer Service Plan ""We are in business to provide safe, dependable, and friendly air transportation to our customers, along with numerous related services, in the hopes that you will fly us again and again."" My wife and I found the reverse opposite to be true when traveling out of both Houston and Phoenix this weekend. The ticket agents were all (six people that we worked with anyway) poorly informed of the airline process and procedure, stunningly rude and belligerent. It boggles my mind that this airline is still in business, I guess size trumps quality for American's ridership. I however, will never again purchase a ticket with American Airlines."
2712,"Dallas Fort Worth to Wichita Falls flight AA3339 was delayed due to weather. However, minimal efforts were provided to comfort the passengers. Cots and blankets were piled in one area, first come first serve. No compensation was provided (i.e. food vouchers, coupons for future flights, water). No one offered to dim the lights. No efforts were made to silence or turn off the televisions. I asked one of the attendants for something as little as ear foam plugs but none were provided. On top of all of that, there was a fire alarm test of the building that lasted approximately 20 minutes at 4am. Attendants refused to provide the customer's baggage to leave the airport to seek lodging elsewhere and/or procure other transportation to their destination. Customer satisfaction reached a new level of low. Flight attendants all departed from the airport after cots and blankets were distributed. It seemed like the attendants said, ""It's not my problem anymore"". It is understandable that decisions were made from the bosses in the top, however it is the attendant's responsibility to try to provide maximum comfort to the passengers whenever possible. The little things really do matter!"
2713,"Don't volunteer to give up your seat unless you are prepared for significant hassle. They asked for volunteers, I asked when the next flight was, they told me it was an hour later. I stood at the counter for about 45 minutes while they tried to figure out how to do this. By then, my original flight had departed. It was then that I was told the next flight was seven hours later. Upon arriving I told the reps at the American Airlines baggage claim desk that I had moved to a later flight. They told me that my luggage had been transferred to the new flight and should be at the baggage claim. I watched the baggage belt go round and round for forty five minutes before asking a different rep, who said my bag had come through on my original flight. He got it in five minutes. Overall, a colossal waste of time trying to do something nice. It's just business to them. They do not care."
2714,"Dallas to Quito via Miami. What was supposed to be a routine departure from Dallas at 5am with an arrival at Quito at 2pm (via quick stopover in Miami) turned into a 24 hour shocking debacle all due to the unprofessional couldn't give a hoot attitude of ground staff. We cleared security at 4.15 and checked on the board that we were still for Gate C22 . The board confirmed Gate C22 and we proceeded directly there. At 4.40 an announcement was made that the gate had changed to A39 - two terminals away. By the time we got there (with quite a few others) they had closed the boarding! They blamed it on us for not checking the board 60 minutes before departure. On telling them we checked 45 minutes before departure they said they had no control over the board and that we should have googled ""something"" to check on the Gate! Her attitude was belligerent, demeaning and in my opinion she should not have that job. We were put on a later flight that missed our connection. On arrival in Miami, we asked for hotel accommodation, or at least meal/beverage tickets for our 8 hour delay but were told they only did that for ""mechanical "" delays and not for people that missed their flights, again putting the blame on us. The attitude and belligerence of this staff member was on a par with her Dallas counterpart. She told us our baggage had proceeded on the flight we missed - so much for security - and she promised it would be on our flight to Quito that evening. I did not trust her advice and later asked another staff member. He said they could not tell where the baggage was but that it would be on our evening flight (so one of them was lying). Anyway, we finally got to Quito to spend another 90 minutes waiting and then complaining that our luggage had not arrived. The queue at the lost baggage desk was unbelievable ~ all with similar stories. They promised we would get the luggage today - but it is still in Miami! Woeful, incompetent, unprofessional and rude ground staff all with belligerent attitudes. We will never fly with American Airlines again."
2715,"American Airlines from Honolulu to Los Angeles. The good news is new aircraft on all Hawaii routes. Truly not bad. Flight on time, staff cordial, food acceptable - just ok. Interactive entertainment has good content but very clumsy to operate. Why tag luggage premium when it just has no meaning? It actually makes it worse with expectations not met."
2716,"London to Los Angeles, returning Miami to London Heathrow with American Airlines. Cabin crew excellent on both flights. The return flight from MIA was delayed by 3 hours after we had to return to the gate. The expalnation given wasn't really ample, something about lack of catering and that we had to refuel due to the longer then usual taxiing, sounded really strange to us. Anyway, rebookings for missed connections at LHR were taken care of, and we were given new boarding cards when we got off the plane at LHR, no stress. Regarding the flights, we liked the new seat. It is very comfortable for sleeping although it could have a little more padding. Better than British Airways Club World seat in my opinion (BA is better for privacy if you are in a window seat). IFE and WiFi are very good, good movie selection and relaible WiFi (but it should be free of charge in business class, charging 17USD is borderline indecent). Food could also use a little improvement (love their ice cream sundaes though, which sadly weren't available on the inbound flight). There were no amenity bags for the MIA-LHR leg something I actually missed because I had most of my stuff in the checked baggage and I had no moisturiser at hand. Worst part of the journeys were probably ground service at Miami which left alot to be desired, staff were rude and not very helpful. Overall a good business class product that needs some minor improvements. Would book with the airline again."
2717,"What's the point of flying first class on American Airlines if they limit your access to the lounge at terminal 8 at New York JFK. The lounge attentent said it was too short a flight to allow access to the first class lounge. These types of policies are the reason I switched from this airline years ago. Even though the flight has been delayed for 2 hours, they still won't give access. Don't fly this airline, I won't ever again!"
2718,"My wife booked a flight to South Korea with one layover each way. American Airlines took it upon themselves to change her return flight schedule and add one more layover to her schedule which had a 57 minute window. When she got to her first connecting flight she was told that her flight was delayed which only allowed for 17 minutes to get her second connection which she will obviously miss. American Airlines was kind enough to make her wait all night in Chicago and fly her out at 7:15am, 10 hours later. This is the second time in a row this airline has done this. I will never fly with this company again. I don't care if I have to pay 500 dollars extra. If you buy a certain flight schedule they should have to honor your purchase. I wouldn't have booked this flight if I had known they could do this. They were absolutely no help resolving this issue."
2719,"American Airlines must be one of the worst airlines in the world. We flew from London Heathrow to Dallas to be told our next flight to Lima was cancelled, and we were rebooked on to another flight via Los Angeles to Lima leaving 20 hours later. Also we were told the delay was due to the weather and there would be no food or drink vouchers. Between Heathrow and Lima via Dallas and LAX one of our bags went missing, due to American Airlines transferring us to another airline. They took no responsibility for the loss, even though both bags were checked in with American Airlines. Out of seven flights we took on this 12 day holiday, 5 were with American Airlines and all had delays for different reasons, totalling 27 hours. All staff were totally unhelpful and at worst they were very rude. Anybody reading this and thinking of using American Airlines, do yourself a favour and use any other company - it will save you yourself a whole lot of stress."
2720,"American Airlines was not a pleasant experience. It was my first and more than likely will be my last time using them. I was suppose to fly from Milwaukee to Dallas to Austin. Due to fog, we had to land in San Antonio. I can understand weather delays and the fact that it is out of the employees control. I did not appreciate however having to sit on the tarmac in San Antonio, TX for 2 plus hours. Furthermore, we were not offered any potential deal, whereas I needed to get to Austin which was closer to San Antonio. Only the people with the final destination as San Antonio were able to deplane. I could have taken a rental car to get to Austin, as it was closer to San Antonio. Instead, we had to wait 2 plus hours, fly back to Dallas and deal with it. After getting back to Dallas finally, they had only 2 concierce working a 75 plus person line. What was even more irritating was someone came down the line handing out a customer service number and basically said, this is what you will need to do. I called, was put on hold for 10 minutes and then hung up on. I called again, at which time they were able to get me on a 4:59 pm flight out of Dallas to Austin. Shocker, that flight was delayed until 6:59 p.m. and once on the runway was delayed another 20 minutes. Not once did someone say, sorry about your delay, not once was I offered an airport meal/beverage. I do not expect anyone to comp airfare, but the attitude displayed throughout the day was ""deal with it"" more or less. I will put my name to it though, as I am not one to say something and remain anonymous. "
2721,"My American Airlines flight, together with 5 others, was cancelled due to pilots not turning up for work. Flight was due to leave 6.30 pm, I was finally in the hotel 12.30 am at the other end of Miami. Staff did not know what they were doing, it was general misinformation and chaos. I was put up for the night in average suburban Marriott (Fairfield Inn) while I had a nice hotel by the sea booked in Provo, which I had to pay for anyway. I had also pre-booked the following day's return flight to Grand Turk. When I asked customer relations at AA where to send invoices for refund on the Grand Turk flight and difference in the cost of the hotel, they refused, saying ""we have made a decision not to assume financial responsibility in situations we are unable to control"". They reassured me while re-booking me that it will not be a problem to get a refund by contacting Customer Relations. So they were lying bluntly! "
2722,"Mistakes are understandable but this experience was beyond stressful. We usually pay more to fly on another airline because American is known for poor communication and organization. Huge mistake trying American again! We are still sitting in the airport for our flight, over 5 hours late. The worst part about it is that if it weren't for other passengers no one would have known about the delays. The women at the gate literally argued that there were no delays with people who had waited hours with no update. Leaving over 100 people scattering to change their connecting flights. The most inconsiderate airline I have ever experienced. It was this horrible 5 years ago and it has only gotten worse! Do not waste your money on an airline that does not take care of their patrons. The terrible customer service and communication ruins the experience for the whole family."
2723,"I found American Airlines service disgusting. I booked a returned flight to Brasil from London Heathrow via Miami, and American Airlines was the worse I have seen. I normally use BA and Virgin as well as TAM. The AA flight attendants were rude, without manners and extremely unprofessional. They managed to lose my luggage and no one can give a proper and clear answer!  The cheaper option of American Airlines became expensive to me now. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone!"
2724,"I was disappointed with the outgoing 3-hour delay on American Airlines, but stunned with the overnight delay on the return. They offered no apology, vouchers for hotels, meals, a cab, and even said at the airport that we had to call reservations on our cell phones to rearrange connecting flights for the next day. As a teacher with a job I cannot miss, this was extremely inconvenient. No explanations were offered about the delay, except that the plane was arriving late from it's last location. The announcements of delays were very late, right around the 4pm scheduled departure time, well after they were informed of a delay (2:30pm, according to the national reservation office). This left no time to find alternative flights for the same day. I had to spend an hour in the lobby calling the national reservation office multiple times to check on flights from neighboring airports, even Dulles and Reagan International, several hours away, but there was no time (or vouchers for transportation) to get there. Delays overnight are inexcusable by a major airline, particularly when there is no snow or other obvious impeding weather."
2725,"Boston to Aruba via Miami. The worst travelling experience ever! The plane from Boston to Miami was extremely old and very dirty, and it doesn't even have personal TVs except the ancient TVs hanging from the ceiling, which are totally obsolete! The seats were so uncomfortable. The seat across from me was torn and ripped. Horrible customer service. The flight attendants were rude and looked half asleep. The flight attendant rolled her eyes at me when I asked where the bathrooms were - rolled her eyes, pointed and said nothing. The bathrooms were dirty and toilets wouldn't even flush. The flight from Miami to Aruba was the same. A very old plane, horrible service and horrible food. The whole experience was miserable and I will never fly American again."
2726,"I have been an American Airlines frequent flyer for many, many years. I don’t fly the airline nearly as much now that we have moved to Hilton Head Island, since connections from Savannah are not in general as good as for other airlines to the destinations to which we fly. Recently my wife and I took a cruise from Barcelona to Lisbon on Oceania Cruise lines on which, as part of the package, they booked us on AA for outbound flights from Savannah to Philadelphia to Barcelona. As soon as I knew our flights, I went online to select seats, and the only ones we could get were the two center seats of the middle section (seat configuration 2-4-2). As my wife really likes window seats for transatlantic flights, I attempted to change seats at the check-in desk in Philadelphia. We were then able to get the G and H (side aisle and window) seats in row 35, the last economy row aft in the airplane. That is usually fine with us - quiet and a little more room. We flew those seats on Qantas for 14 hours to New Zealand. I sat in the aisle seat. I am 5’6” tall, 148 pounds. Even at my relatively small size, my seat was so narrow that it was impossible for me for to keep my left elbow inside the seat rest, especially during sleep. Since AA continues to pack seats in the plane, even at the back where the width of the fuselage tapers (where I was sitting), the width of the aisle was only barely wide enough to let the service cart through. Seriously, it is beyond belief that AA would just cram extra seats in the back and make people uncomfortable just to make a few extra dollars. As a result, my left elbow was hit almost every time the service cart went by, for the entire flight. So, while trying to sleep, I was bumped awake all night for every transit of the flight attendant and the cart. In addition, our flight attendant was stressed, terse, harried, and rude, from the very first interaction, indicating a lack of either appropriate personnel selection or inadequate training. American Airlines in-flight meal was at best mediocre, and their free alcohol selection abysmal – they offered only beer, or cardboard-boxed wine, far below the selections of other transatlantic airlines, even those that are US-based. We flew Air France home from Lisbon through Paris to Atlanta, and then on to Savannah. Our transatlantic flight featured large, leather, comfortable seats, excellent food, flight attendants, and choice of drinks, so that I know an airline can make money and make passengers happy at the same time. My wife and I paid $1100 for the privilege of enduring this awful, cramped, uncomfortable American Airlines flight, the same price as all the other economy cabin passengers flying further forward. I have sent a letter to American Airlines about this experience and can only hope that they look at the letter seriously and improve their service, seating, and staff. If not, I hope that their current flight standard eventually generates enough negative feedback that passengers choose other carriers and they go out of business. That way their routes and traffic can be taken over by other more passenger-friendly airlines (which are virtually every other one that we have flown). "
2727,"Atlanta to Miami flight supposed to depart at 9:30am. Got a call at 2am that the flight is delayed. 12:15 pm now. Ok no problem we'll still get to Miami in time to catch the cruise. Get to gate and they are boarding a different flight to Miami. No other information except unprofessional person telling us they are confused as well. Waiting here - no plane. Should have flown United Airlines. American Airlines, never again."
2728,"Los Angeles to Shanghai with American Airlines. On time, good connections, hospitable crew and a smooth flight. On a flight this long (13 hours) I've been in the habit of getting up from my seat 2 times or more and taking a short walk, usually hanging out for a spell behind or beside the crews station in the rear of the cabin. Not permitted on this flight it seems. The airplane had plenty of space elsewhere. Overall, one of my best flights, all that was important went well."
2729,Absolutely appalling - never again. American Airlines provides a convenient non-stop service but the cabin quality is appalling. If I were an employee I would be embarrassed. The fascia looked as though a cup of coffee has been thrown over it. The in seat power has one connection per seat (there are two seats next to each other) and the configuration of the sockets means that you cannot use both at the same time. Other airlines are so so much better. Next time I will go indirect with United and the inconvenience of the extended journey rather than this. It is such poor value for money.
2730,"Full flight from Miami to Lima. Embarked, then told to debark due to some technical issues. Thus, delayed flight. An hour later boarded the same plane - old, falling apart Boeing 757. Torn seat upholstery, broken armrests, non-existent entertainment, lousy service. Plane felt cramped, as there were not enough space for all the luggage in the overhead bins and it was stored everywhere, reducing already minimal leg room for most. Exit row ""economy premium"" upgrade is a scam - hard, narrow seat with abysmal recline. I would never pay anything extra for this!  There were no proper fastened seat belts checks done and laptop bags and other items were allowed to be stored on the floor, blocking emergency exits. Sad, if this is the way ""new American Airlines"" feels, looks and flies like. Fly someone else, if you can."
2731,"I have never been so disappointed in an airline. I made reservations with American Airlines months ago so that I can have the perfect flight.  When I was talking to the representative on the phone I explained very clearly what I wanted, a window seat. However some time after booking our flight and before the day we were supposed to fly American Airlines changed the plane. That would not have been too bad if their email that was sent to me did not go into my Spambox. Getting ready to print our boarding passes, I saw this plane was a three seater and I had a choice of the aisle or middle seat! I wanted a window seat and made that very clear to the representative I spoke with when booking my flight. I called American Airlines and told them how upset I was and the rep said there was nothing she could do about it. I am stuck on their plane, it was impossible for me to book another flight with another airlines. When I got on the plane, I asked very quietly if I could have an extra seat belt. Well as I was walking to our seat, the staff member reach out and said Miss, here is the extra seat belt!  I was so embarrassed that I wanted to drop down and hide! Really, to have someone hand you a seatbelt in front of the rest of the passengers just showed me how unprofessional American Airline employees are. I am now on this plane in the aisle and anyone that passes me, hits me! This is what I had to endure the entire flight. We finally arrive and it couldn’t be soon enough. We walk to get our luggage and no luggage! We walk to the office and find out that American Airlines chose to put our luggage on another plane. The lady behind the desk tells us in one hour your luggage will be here. You can wait or they will deliver our luggage to where we are staying! Asking again how long will that take, she said only 1 Hour! Why did I believe her - arriving in New Orleans with heels on and warmer clothes because we were coming from Washington DC on this very uncomfortable flight, we asked to have the luggage delivered to our hotel.  After two hours I try calling their customer service to find my luggage. The lady tells me our luggage is at the airport waiting for a driver to deliver them. When we finally received our luggage, hours later they were damaged. Do not pay extra for priority boarding because I watched with my own eyes the representative allow people Who did not pay get on board before us who did pay."
2732,"Venice to Raleigh via Philadelphia with American Airlines. On our return from a wonderful Italian vacation, we had 4 confirmed seats on a connecting flight out of Philadelphia. Upon arrival, we learned that the connecting flight had been cancelled - no email or text notice - no explanation - no alternate seat arrangements. The improperly titled ""Passenger Service"" rep simply said, ""It happens"" and spent the next 10-15 minutes arranging Stand-By seats on a flight to Charlotte, NC and Stand-By from there to Raleigh. I explained that we didn't pay for stand-by status and wanted confirmed seats. She said that this was the best she could do unless we wanted to spend the night in Phil. We spent the rest of the night getting bumped. I will avoid American like the plague in the future."
2733,"Excellent cabin service, the dinner was better than average and the wine was very good. Overall almost back to the level of the 90's. Equipment was new with large screen individual seat video. Plane was full with usual carry-on bag kerfuffle. Left the gate 5 minutes late and waited in-line about 20 minutes for a take-off slot. Arrived in SFO about 10 minutes early. Overall excellent flight."
2734,"Oneworld Emerald business class customer. American Airlines Miami Emerald check in is inadequate and unacceptable. It should not take 30 minutes to get through the queue. Highly chaotic check in area and experience. Emeralds can no longer do Flagship check in which results in long delays. American Airlines Miami lounges are beyond appalling and subpar. WiFi spotty, food choices poor, overcrowded and dirty. The fact that there is no Flagship lounge in an AA international hub such as Miami is also unacceptable. Indefinite delay on today's flight with little/no information ahead of time or during the delay. Passengers wandering around having no idea what to do. Very poor form on all levels and won't be repeating anytime soon."
2735,"American Airlines is the worst airline I have ever flown, and I have never had a single on-time flight. I have always had to run to my connecting flight. during my last trip with American my plane out of Las Vegas was 45 minutes late forcing me to run across the airport to my connecting flight and when I got there my next flight hadn't shown up. (Should have seen that coming) Then my connecting flight was delayed 30 minutes before they would update us not before we could board. After waiting they then notified us that the flight would be delayed another hour. I would have rather road horse back, that way I would have been able to get to my destination on time."
2736,"American Airlines is the worst airline I've ever flown. They are rude and late in some capacity or another. My husband and I flew American to and from Hawaii, and it was nothing but nightmare after nightmare. Sure the flight was cheap, but in this case you certainly got only what you paid for. There are no complimentary meals for the long flight and no wi-fi. It must be a miracle American is still in business. Flying Delta next time."
2737,First American Airlines flight out of Palm Springs was supposed to leave at 6am. Didn't leave til 8 because flight attendants had to sleep in because they worked late. Captain on the same plane the night before got there on time. Then missed connecting flight in Dallas. Got ticket for the next flight. Sitting here they are 2 hours late. Hopefully it doesn't get cancelled. Every time I fly AA same thing. Late flights with terrible service. Never again.
2738,"Delays and cancellations are the norm for the American Airlines flights from the USA to Rome. Our flight was only 2 hours delayed, but on the return trip, the first flight, (111) was delayed hourly until 4pm, at which time it was cancelled. The next day, the flight was again delayed hourly until 4pm, at which time it was again cancelled. The third day, we moved to flight 721, which was delayed hourly until 3:30pm. which caused all of the connecting flights to be missed. We spent the third night in Charlotte, N.C., and finally made it home Wednesday afternoon, much later than 7:30pm Sunday scheduled arrival. The airline decided that two $100 dollar vouchers to fly with them again was more than sufficient to make up for a 3 day delay. Two weeks later, my wife's cousin was on flight 111 from Rome to Chicago, and it was cancelled again. The received nothing from the airline."
2739,"American Airlines has the worst customer service and highest cancellation rate I have ever experienced. My flight was delayed for 6 hrs and than cancelled without notice to all of sitting at the gate for hours. Than when the only other rebooked flight was in the morning they didn't give me a food voucher or hotel voucher and I had to fend for myself. When. I came back to my newly rebooked flight the attendant said I had somehow ""accidentally"" been cancelled out of my seat! I was than put on standby on a departing flight in the next gate and told to wait in another line for 20min. I managed to make it on the flight but that flight than stood on the tarmac for over an hr past scheduled departure time. I understand extenuating circumstances, but come on, this is ridiculous."
2740,"American Airlines has lousy timing and customer service. My flight was supposed to be at 6:15. A crew member got sick - which you would think is a regular enough occurrence that they would have a plan for dealing with that. But apparently their best back-up plan was to fly in a whole other plane 4 hours later - and then getting that off the ground 30 minutes late. No concern whatsoever for timeliness. And this is pretty typical, today was just particularly atrocious."
2741,"London Heathrow to St Louis via Chicago with American Airlines. The flight was awesome with the attendants all performing their jobs wonderfully. The food was very good as well with, considering it was breakfast, very well sized portions. Even though it is an older product, the flight was very comfortable indeed."
2742,"Phoenix to San Francisco, Seat 4D. Boarding priority given to first class passengers and passengers with elite status. Flight departed on time. No inflight entertainment on former US Airways aircraft therefore safety demonstration conducted by flight crew in a very effective manner. Flight crew very pleasant. Once airborne, refreshments were provided. Flight attendant on this particular flight in first class is nice and efficient. She took drink orders by rows. Once she served the drinks, she came back with the snack basket and offered to passengers. She came around second time taking more drink orders and offered more snack. Snack on offer was pretty good: Kettle potato chips, organic oatmeal cookies, mixed nuts, etc. I wish there were fresh food like banana and apple but what on offer was more than sufficient for the 90 minute flight. Interior of aircraft well maintained although the seat pitch in first class is a little tight. I think it is maybe 38 inches, like premium economy on other international airlines. But the American Airlines Boeing 737-800 aircraft seems to have better pitch, I think maybe 42 inches, but the four extra inches make a world of difference. A couple of minor complaints, no hot towel service and no pre departure drinks. That is maybe I chose to board the aircraft last so I don't have to sit while waiting for the other 180 passengers to board and walked by me and knock me over with the oversized suitcases. One recommendation for American Airlines is that they should enforce cabin bags regulations as many passengers are cheap and chose to bring the oversize suitcases onboard rather than paying check baggage fees. Smooth flight with a very pleasant female captain. Arrival into San Francisco ahead of schedule. A fairly good flight."
2743,"Houston to Manchester via Chicago with American Airlines. The most terrible flying experience I have had. Firstly the horrible customer service - they don't look at you when you ask a question, don't reply, don't smile, don't even dress smartly. The staff are so rude. The aircraft itself is so old, it has barely any leg room, horrible seats, no personal entertainment, and even if it was available it wasn't working. For a flight that flies over the ocean for more than 7 hours what do you expect the sleep deprived, uncomfortable passengers to do?  I had to buy alcohol, the food was terrible and barely filling for an adult. I will never fly American Airlines even if I have to pay extra! "
2744,"Calgary to New York via Toronto/Chicago. They left me a voicemail to let me know that the first segment of my 2-segment flight got cancelled and to call them so they could reschedule me on another flight. I call AA and explain the situation, and this girl is telling me that they can't do anything for me. Why did they call me and tell me that they would put me on another flight then? I got another voicemail from them the next day saying the exact same thing, so I called back and managed to get myself on another flight. Comes the day of the flight, I am at the airport 2 hours early, and my tickets haven't even been ticketed! I spent a whole hour and a half on the phone with a representative to fix the whole thing, and by that time, I received another call from AA to tell me that the 2nd segment of my flight has been cancelled - 7 hours before its departure! The rep on the phone finally managed to find a 3-segment flight to my destination. By that time, it's too late for me to make my first flight, and thank god for WestJet (operating the flight) front desk, they managed to push me through and off I went, running for my life to make the initial segment of my flight. Flights from each segments were late, so I had to run for it between every flight. Thanks for the terrible quality, poor service and added stress.  I am never flying American Airlines again. "
2745,"London to Baltimore via Philadelphia with American Airlines. Cabin staff on the plane leaving Heathrow practically shouted at one of the passengers for mistakenly pressing the call button rather than reading light. Too scared to ask for anything for fear of same treatment. Earphones terrible, continuos buzzing sound and one ear no sound at all. Food choice terrible and tasteless. Delayed internal flights meant missing connecting flights hence needed taxi for another airport an hour away to board another flight. Thankfully they paid for this but the anxiety of it all! Return flight to Heathrow, no inflight entertainment whatsoever. Communal tv screen with sometimes inappropriate content for children. Again some cabin crew not very nice, bordering on rude."
2746,"Flew Miami to New York JFK yesterday on a fairly new A321S - was pleased to snag the two seater in the exit row (24D/E) which had excellent leg space. Despite the full flight and the usual nightmare of boarding and finding overhead locker space, we left on time and arrived early. The pluses - punctuality, new plane, nice cabin design and comfortable leather seats with AVOD, friendly crew (some of them anyway). The negative - unsurprisingly all the entertainment worth watching (like any snacks etc) had to be paid for, the interactive flight map also wasn't activated."
2747,"Good to know some things never change and American Airlines is still the worst airline in USA. What an embarrassment. As usual ran out of a choice of food, messed up airmiles (still waiting). Surly and frosty staff on the planes, who just want to sleep and not give service. The staff had no idea about landing forms and customs forms.  No individual TV's on a full service transatlantic flight. Give me a break. And few tiny screens scattered in aisles that probably 50% couldn't see. No one asked once in 18 hours round trip if my 18 month infant was okay or needed anything. Except the one time a man working for American came to tell him off for clicking the attendant button. Except he didn't! It was a faulty button that kept coming on. And it was my button, not his. Great customer service folks. No one checked to see if he was even strapped in. Only flew because was the cheapest flight and only direct flight close to home. Will not be doing so again. Their three strikes are about 10 by now. No more American Airlines."
2748,"American Airlines from San Francisco to Phoenix, seat 10D. Exit Row. Departed slightly late but arrived into PHX a few minutes early. Flight crew fairly pleasant. Briefing before taking off for exit row passengers. No inflight entertainment on US Airways aircraft therefore flight crew did the safety demonstration. After takeoff, drinks service began. Pleasant crew and ontime flight arrival. Slept most of the flight and did not check in bags. Fairly pleasant flight. Got the flight for $81. Bargain and no complaint."
2749,"Our American Airlines flight from ORD to STL was cancelled without detailed explanation. They did not offer accomodation or really any other option. Customer service at the gate were very grumpy, unprofessional and disrespectful. I had to rent a car and drive to St. Louis which was very costly. I sent an email to customer relationship and their response was that they don't reimburse for cancelled flights, but they will further investigate matter and get back to me. They never contacted me. I will never again fly on American Airlines. "
2750,"I am a Concierge Key member on AA. I fly around 200k+ miles/year. In spite of the effort to remodel old planes American Airlines still has many old 777 in routes such as London and Madrid. But that is temporary (or so we hope). What is hard to understand is why a crew can be so unprepared and unprofessional (or at least part of it) JFK to MIA: First two flight attendants were missing. All passengers (since no preboarding was done) left on the jet bridge until somebody decided to show up (a minimum number of flight attendants is required to board a plane. So why did they start boarding ?) When the crew shows up decided to play the PA music at the loudest possible volume. Everybody in the plane complaining since we could not even talk or listen to the person seating right next. No menus. To get a glass of wine (first class and after paying $900+ for a round ticket) I had to ask three times. Asked twice to hang my coat. The flight attendant told me he was busy and could come back in a few minutes. Asked him again 5 min later. He could not care less! I gave up and carried the jacket on my lap the rest of the trip. Better than insisting with somebody that clearly is not prepared for his job. When I add this type of unprofessional service to the fact that AA charges substantially more than other Airlines on the same exact route (compare MIA-MAD on AA and on Iberia in Business for example), I wonder why I am still flying AA. Well I am already building mileage on other airlines so I can eliminate AA from my flight options."
2751,The new lay-flat seats in business class offer a great way to go. The seats offer good isolation from the other passengers and the in-flight entertainment controls were the best I have seen. Pretty much everything has been thought of in designing these seats. The service on the night flight to London was a little uneven and the food average. The service and the food on the return flight from London to LAX were excellent. The 777-300er is a nice plane and the American Airlines business class in this plane is excellent.
2752,"This was my first time flying American Airlines. When boarding the plane they told us there was no space for carry-ons inside the plane, forcing everyone to check their carry-ons. There was lots of people with their electronic devices, computers, and important loose items in their hands. Then, when in the plane, after a 45 minute delay, they told us that they could not put our baggage inside our plane. Incredible, and one of the worst flying experiences I have ever had."
2753,"I booked these flights without reviewing the airline as I thought they were in the One World Alliance and therefore should be fine. Once booked I read the reviews for this airline and thought I had made a huge mistake. However, we had no problems whatsoever, from checking in online, dropping bags off at the airport to reaching our destinations. All four of our flights departed on time and two arrived early. The boarding was fine and the flights were either full or nearly full. The first leg of our flight from Manchester to PHL left on time the the first round of service took place very quickly, the chicken dish we had was tasty and hot, one of the best airline meals I have had! Drinks were generous and came round a couple of times with each service. The flight attendants were good and we had a laugh with a couple of them. I could certainly have no hestitation in booking with American Airlines in the future."
2754,"Could not believe that an approved size/weight hand held luggage was not allowed on the plane with me because of some rule they have. They get all travellers regardless of class with travel wheel based approved luggage to valet check just before entering the plane. Only American Airlines could do that to 1st class and all economy passengers! Why do they have onboard baggage sizes and weights guides when it goes in the hull anyway?  On the flight the FA thought it was cool to stuff food in his face and chew it while doing the safety demo. Unreal only American Airlines could turn air travel into a subway trip to the Bronx and not a pleasant experience it was designed for. Disgusting airline, staff attitude and policies.  I will be looking for direct flights from overseas so I don't have to travel internally with American Airlines again."
2755,"Our American Airlines flight from Manchester to JFK was delayed by over 3.5 hours with no explanation. When I looked into the history of this route, this daily flight has not departed on time even once in the last 28 days. The flight itself was okay once we got going, but really departing and arriving on time is pretty fundamental to how highly an airline can be rated."
2756,"Because I am used to economy airlines, riding American was a change. While the flight on the CRJ-200 was operated by Air Wisconsin under the US Airways Express tag, the parent was still American. Overall the flight attendants were polite and attentive. I asked one of the stewardess (737-800 flight from DCA to ORD) how her day was going and how many flights she had today. She replied with her answer, then gave me a an entire can of Coca-Cola. Surprising considering that they aren't supposed to do that. Though $25 each way for a bag is excessive, it does beat the economy airlines. Their airfare is high, but because this was school sponsored, I only had to pay for the bags. Overall, including a 30-minute delay at DCA, not bad."
2757,"I booked a flight from Paris to Columbus, with a stop in New York (JFK). Shortly after booking my ticket, I noticed that American Airlines allowed just more than an hour to make the connection. Since I would be coming into JFK on an international flight, and would need to go through customs and re-check baggage before continuing on to my connecting flight. I become concerned about the time crunch and called American Airlines to verify that I would have enough time to make the connection. They assured me that I would, so I moved forward with the planned itinerary. When I arrived into New York from Paris, I was pleased that American Airlines had sent an employee to wait for me at the gate to give me an expedited pass through customs so that I could catch my connecting flight. Unfortunately, after clearing customs, I waited for an additional 30 minutes to get my checked baggage, so that I could re-check it. I literally ran the entire way through the airport to catch my flight. I arrived at my gate exactly 9 minutes before the flight was scheduled to take off, but the flight was already gone. Not only was the door shut, but the airplane was already gone from the gate. This left me wondering why American Airlines authorized a flight to leave early when not all of its passengers had arrived at the gate. I was especially disappointed since I was traveling with my wife and infant son, and we were all very tired after a long day of traveling (we began our journey the day before flying with a different airline into Paris). An American Airlines agent at the gate kindly re-booked me for a flight the next day, but informed me that I would need to wait in the check-in line in order to ask about a hotel voucher. After waiting in line and speaking with a check-in agent about a hotel voucher, I was informed that since my flight from Paris was on time, they would not give me a voucher. I explained that I had run through the airport, and that the reason I had missed my flight was because my bags did not come through for more than 30 minutes after I had cleared customs. The check-in agent seemed to feel genuinely sorry, but reiterated that he would not give me a hotel voucher. Instead, I paid $300 to get a decent hotel on short notice. It is frustrating and unfortunate that American Airlines would feel it more important to avoid additional cost than to reimburse a customer for an expense that American Airlines had caused. American Airlines made two mistakes:  They authorized a flight to push off early, even though they knew they had passengers rushing from a connecting flight.  They did not give a hotel voucher even though they were late in getting checked bags to the carousel, resulting in a missed flight and need for a place to stay for the night. Nobody likes to be taken advantage of when they are vulnerable. This is how American Airlines treated me and my family. For this reason, I will avoid using American Airlines in the future when possible."
2758,"This was American Airlines flights from Miami to Norfolk via Charlotte. This was a previous USAir route for sure. Our departing flight was delayed by nearly 30 minutes, but thanks to modern unexplicable airline scheduling, we still arrived into Charlotte an hour before our connecting flight which was on time. American is really more of a no frills airline than the so called discount airlines. Both of our flights were on repainted USAir planes which had no in cabin entertainment at all, other than wifi which I did not bother to connect to. No snacks served either. Both of these planes, while clean, were definitely on the worn side. One thing I will add, is for the first time I used Americans mobile boarding pass. This can be obtained via their app or emailed. With this and not checking bags, I had absolutely no contact with any airport agents. I also slept on both flights so I had no inflight contact with flight crew. I saw people with paper boarding passes and thought, how 2000's! I ultimately arrived on time and safely into Norfolk. I guess thats the ultimate goal when flying domestically these days!"
2759,"My flight to Colorado Springs went fine, but my return flight was horrible. I got to Dallas where I was supposed to catch my connecting flight, two hours early. I waited in the terminal and my flight kept getting pushed back. They would not tell us anything except that the plane was rerouted to San Antonio. About an hour and a half after we were supposed to board, they finally told us that the flight was cancelled and that we had to rebook. I went to the desk and they had me call the customer service number, which the woman I talked to wasn't helpful at all. I told her that I needed the earliest flight possible, but she kept listing flights that were extremely late in the day. I am 26 weeks pregnant, and didn't have any more money for food or a hotel room and they refused to give vouchers for food or a hotel, so I wound up having to sleep in the airport with nothing to eat. They finally got me on a flight, and we had taxied onto the runway, when the plane just stopped. No real explanation why. We sat on the plane waiting for it to take off for an hour, before we finally got off the ground. I will not be flying American again."
2760,"I missed a connection on America Airlines / US Air in July because the handicap cart in the airport was late. Handicap cart was in the record. When I told the agent I was going to use a wheelchair she said it was too far and to wait. Missed the connection listening to her. I was rebooked coach and have yet to receive a refund on the first class portion of the flight. Today I was to fly first class from Vegas to Memphis through Charlotte. Arrived at airport early enough but line and service even for first class was so long and slow missed flight even though had already checked in and had boarding passes. Agent apologized and admitted they were slow because of cancellations in Dallas. Would not send my bags later and let me board flight. No curb service for bag. It will take an act of congress to get refund for half of this $1500 first class ticket and now I am stranded. Higher tickets, record profits, less customer service. If at all possible never fly American ."
2761,"Our American Airlines flight from Chicago to Dallas Fort Worth was departing at 7am. However once we got on the flight we were told that we wouldn't be able to leave for an hour because someone didn't finish their paperwork and the hydraulic fluid needed to be filled. After that hour the door was closed and the pilot said we were ready to leave but still waiting on last minute paperwork so it would be about 5 more minutes. Finally, at 8:40, our plane started moving and we got to the runway only to be told by our pilot that the weather conditions at Fort Worth were too severe so they shut down the airport and they will keep us updated on when we get to leave. We are currently trapped in the plane waiting to find out if we will actually leave Chicago today or not. If there was a section below for zero stars, I'd be marking that."
2762,"Dallas to Oklahoma with American Airlines. While delays due to weather are understandable, the incompetence of the staff and their inability to explain issues in a polite and respectful manner is disturbing. Overall this was the worst flying experience I have been subjected to and I would not recommend anyone following in my footsteps."
2763,"Cavalier disregard for safety. Time is not of the essence. American Airlines staff (gate and flight attendants) showed no regard for safety whatsoever. Gross overloading of the cabin storage bins was only exceeded by total disregard for safety regarding exit seats. Passengers at the exit seats were permitted to place items too large for the bins between the seats. The flight attendants did not conduct proper checks to ensure passengers seats, seat belts, cabin trays and computers were in fact ready for take off or landing. The passenger briefing for take off was non-existent. The briefing for exit row passengers was worse! The flight was late and overcrowded, due to earlier delays, cancellations and overbooking. Check-in was fair, but boarding was poor."
2764,"I have been a frequent flyer with American Airlines for many years but have to consider to change. I have spoken with many of the staff at Tulsa Airport and all are trying to transfer out to another area. Evidently American is incorporating the policies of US Air in regards to customer service. Unanimously I have been told there will be little or no customer service. I have started seeing this at multiple airports, especially at DFW and with their reservation system. If 20+ year employees are leaving, is it like rats deserting a sinking ship? Not sure if this was a merger or takeover (which was the worst airline I had ever flown). Something to consider."
2765,"The flight was very uncomfortable, cabin staff attitude was that they did not want to be there. Being vegetarian I had booked vegetarian meal, which was not provided. When asked the answer was ""your name is not on the list"". I have experienced this before, but other airlines still make an effort and provide something, but they did not make any effort and I had to stay without food for the journey. Apparently American Airlines has a bad reputation for customer service that they just don't care. I will not recommend to fly on this airline."
2766,"I have has a multitude of terrible experiences over the past year with American, but after this weekend they will never receive my business again. After arriving to my flight just 50 minutes before departure I was not permitted to fly because I was too late. Traffic in LA was gridlocked due to a freeway closure from a mudslide. I was told that I had to pay the exorbinant $200 change fee to go on the later flight which had more than enough room on it. They did not offer the normal $75 same day change fee, or an option to fly standby. I was told they did not offer standby on this flight, however when I got to the gate their were 3 other passengers on standby. I have done everything to get a refund for my fee, which I clearly should not have been charged, but the airline refuses to assist me regardless of my elite status and nearly 500,000 lifetime miles and 15 years of loyalty. Apparently American Airlines has such a horrible reputation for customer service that they just don't care anymore that consumers hate their business. Thanks to congress approving the recent merger they have a ""too big to fail"" mentality and I am sure they will be bailed regardless of how many customers go to the competition. "
2767,"Why don't American Airlines they fix the plane before we get on it? We get on and then they tell us the bathroom is broken. Obviously the customer comes second and making a rating to get us on a plane is first. We will miss our connecting flight and who knows when we will take off,"
2768,Clean cabin and flights on time. American Airlines flight attendants with no smiles and rude behavior. I had the feeling that they hate their jobs and passengers are a necessary evil they have to deal with. Check-in staff in MIA was even worse. The guy wanted to charge me $100 for having 1 Kilo excess baggage. On top of the $25 they charge anyway.  Not a nice experience and I will try to avoid AA in the future. Tickets are not cheap either.
2769,"I'd award American Airlines zero stars if possible. Sunday, September 21,  Miami to Madrid, departure at 6:45PM with a code share on to Casablanca. At 4AM that morning, I am awakened by an automated call from AA, but with no recording - just silence. I check the web site, and the flight is delayed three hours to 9:45 PM. I get another ""mystery"" call waking me at 4:15 and another at 4:30. I shut off the phone. When our group of three gets to the gate that evening, we see the flight is further delayed to 11 PM (no explanation). We board only to find an aircraft that is beyond stuffy and hot - the temp must be in the upper 80s F (31 C). We're told the auxiliary power unit is malfunctioning, and there is a computer problem in the cockpit. By midnight, we're all soaked in sweat, and the temp we are old by an FA has reached 98 F (36 C), beyond union work rules. We're, told rather curtly, and in Spanish only, to get off the plane and wait at the gate. At 1 AM we're rushed back onto the plane. The pilot attempts to start the engines but the plane is plunged into darkness, with the emergency lighting cycling up only after about 30 seconds and the full lights not back on for five or more minutes (video never recovered). He tries this again, with the same result. Now passengers are demanding to get off. The gate agent comes on to give them a stern lecture that they will get no compensation or assistance if they leave since the plane has not been cancelled. At 2AM another attempt is made to start the engines, to no avail. Darkness, then chimes, then emergency lighting. All the while, the plane feels like a Hot Yoga tube. ""Folks,"" the captain said ""if we can just get the engines started we'll be just fine."" At 3 AM, the captain announces the flight is cancelled due to the failure of multiple APUs and FAA crew rules. Chaos reigns at the gate as there is no help with rebooking and announcements are in Spanish. At 3:45 we get our paperwork from the surly agent for the Iberia flight the next day at 5PM. We show up at 1PM only to be told by Iberia, a OneWorld ""partner"", that AA had not properly booked my seat nor endorsed the ticket over properly. (My friends were OK). I spent the next hour and a half running back and forth between the two airlines - they are about 1/3 a mile apart - while AA produced paper ""tickets"" that Iberia would not accept. ""These people are stupid!"" the Iberia guy complained - a helpful, competent, friendly soul so unlike the demonically possessed AA people. He writes down the instructions instructions for the AA idiots (with exclamation marks, no less) and I get the documents 40 minutes before boarding. By now all the seats are gone and I'm on standby. I do get on the Iberia plane - last seat - but after much stress and drama and a wasted $200 a night hotel room in Morocco, which AA will not reimburse. (An EU airline would). The return trip from Casablanca was a further nightmare, as AA ""damaged"" the record somehow. I found this out on a $38 phone call from Madrid back to the U.S. when the frequently down web site showed I was not on the MAD/MIA segment. Avoid this airline at all costs."
2770,"Bradley to Kansas City via Philadelphia. More than a little disappointed with American Airlines. First problem was the sitting arrangement upon ordering tickets online, we were forced to pay a higher fee for premium economy because we did not choose seating the day of original purchase - traveling with a 3 yr old and none of the open seats were next to each other, therefore we were hopeful that we could speak with someone prior to selecting seats to ensure my husband or I were seated next to our child, which we did get but had to pay the extra fee for the premium economy to ensure this. Where the tray table was broken and literally flopped down entirely into my lap and the seat was loose and sliding around under my rear. During our flight from BDL to Philly, our daughter (3 yrs old) had to use the restroom, my husband went to take her and was told by the flight attendant that they had to immediately return to their seats as we were descending and could no longer be up and about - those who have young children should understand, you cannot just tell a 3 yr old child to ""hold it"". What was further infuriating about this scenerio was that we were actually 30 minutes from descending and other passengers were continuing to be up and about to and from the restroom for another 15 minutes after this happened, yet my child was not allowed to go! I have no issues with the safety and rules of an airline but if you are going to tell one person to return to their seat then shouldn't this apply to all passengers?!? Our connecting flight from Philly to MCI wasn't any better, 45 minutes sitting on the tarmac due to delays made our 3 hour and 4 minute flight even longer. The flight attentants were rude and very short when addressed. Are they aware that they entered a public service occupation? After this entire experience, I would definately not recommend this airline for anyone. They have a lot of room for improvement in many areas!"
2771,"Our flight was late departing Sacramento so we missed our connection into Flagstaff and not one American Airlines/US Air employee were concerned. When they dumped us in Phoenix they offered no Help! When we went to baggage claim to recover our bags they told us they didn't know where they were or when they could get them, they suggested we pick them up in Flagstaff but couldn't tell us when. We had to rent a car to get to Flagstaff then return to the airport in Flagstaff a second time to get our bags from the last flight of the day which was also late.  Our flight out of Flagstaff was delayed after they checked everyone through security and took our bags they informed everyone that the plane had a mechanical issue and was not able to take us to Phoenix. We again rented a car to drive to Phoenix after they booked us on another delayed flight which they failed to tell us about when they booked us on the flight. When we finally got to Phoenix we confirmed that our flight was delayed over 3 hours. Once again not a single employee cared nor have we been reimbursed any money or compensation for their screw up. This is the second time this airline did this to us. "
2772,"I used my frequent flyer miles to purchase business class tickets from JFK to Barcelona. It was through AirBerlin. This budget airline was the best part of the experience. The American Airlines part was the worst. We had a 1 hour layover in Dusseldorf on the way back to JFK, but the flight was cancelled to our layover turned into a 9 hour layover. My mother was sick an I needed to be in New York at a scheduled time. AirBerlin asked me to call Aadvantage. When I called, the first agent jsut yelled at me. I literally have not had anybody in service speak to me since I left the USSR in 1978. The second agent after listening to my problem answered with ""And what do you want to do about it?"" and was sarcastic throughout. I thought I was in a bad dream. We got to New York 7 hours late, after spending $200 in roaming charges. I thought Delta was the worst, but American Airlines has the honor now. Do not fly American."
2773,"Book a flight with American Airlines but get a BA flight number. Want to pre book selected seats ? Use BA, no - use American Airlines stupid. Want to chose seats and check in - use BA flight number. Why can't I check in ? After 3 calls to BA's useless customer services"" we are told we can't check in online as it's closed to us, as we didn't select seats in time (news to me and never got any of this information from the website at the time of booking - nor did we get any warning notice telling us of the cut off point). All the more confusing as American Airlines allocated seat to us for the 2nd leg of the journey from JFK to Miami. Confused - we are ! We are offered the chance to pre book online for $30 per seat (what is this scam ?) but impolitely decline after spending a whole day online trying to sort it out. So just to be clear - the first part we have to pay for seats but the connecting flight we had seats allocated by American Airlines (at no cost). On the 2nd leg to Miami from JFK we are warned that, as per usual (in our experience on US domestic flights), there is a massive overbooking of cabin luggage and not enough space. As usual passengers refuse to give up their right to take endless pieces of baggage on with them so there is delay while ground staff literally confiscate baggage to put in the hold. Truly the indignation of tight fisted travellers with totally unrealistic expectations is a sight to behold. Everyone expects to get 2 pieces on board, regardless. No more internal flights for me, thank you. From now on it's British Airways or Virgin and damn the cost. The return flight (direct from Miami to JFK) - is it too much to expect that on a 10 hour flight we might get some inflight entertainment (and I don't mean 1 film). Truly pitiful. We board on the third group (not the last group) and guess what - no overhead locker space. Getting tired of this experience now. US airlines really have to sort this out and impose realistic expectations on their customers. Food average for economy, except the coffee which was really awful (I'm no coffee snob but how can you get this wrong American Airlines?) Cabin crew were okay to rude (congrats to the the one lady that really made the effort, on the other side of the plane). Got a nice warm ""thank you"" from everyone on departing the plane - but that doesn't make up for the previous 10 hours of mean spiritedness from the cabin crew. Ground staff very helpful and a simple, stress free experience. But really it's all about the flight - and American Airlines just don't cut it. It just seems US airlines are all in a race to the bottom (on price) and everything suffers accordingly."
2774,"I was very pleasantly surprised by the excellent quality of our American Airlines flights. The flight cost an unbeatable £300, both flights left on time and arrived well ahead of schedule. The ground service staff and cabin crew were cheerful, polite and professional. Aircraft were clean, and I found the seat comfortable and not especially cramped. The meals were acceptable, and free drink was on offer. The inflight entertainment was delivered via overhead screens, but because I was either reading or sleeping it didn't bother me at all. I have no hesitation in recommending American Airlines."
2775,"I recently flew American Airlines for the first time in years and was reminded why I don't. I was forced to pay extra for a seat on my flight when I had booked the ticket a month in advance and checked in 24 hours prior to my flight. When I got to the airport, still no seats were available and the employee was less than helpful in offering another solution. Once I got to my ""upgraded"" seat, I found that I had no extra room, the armrest was broken and so was the tray table. The flight attendants and airport staff had zero personality and were not very friendly. I will do everything in my power to not fly with American Airlines in the future. To top it off, the only way to get in touch with customer service to file a complaint is via email. The representative who responded had no sympathy and basically told me to kick rocks. I was unable to respond to the message because it was sent from an unspecified email address. The worst customer service I have experienced possibly ever."
2776,"Don't fly with American Airlines! Having booked our business class flight with British Airways we had to use American Airlines from LAX to Honolulu. We had a 6 hour wait in LAX for our ongoing flight so decided to use the American Airlines lounge. Fat chance! We were refused entry as we weren't members! Even after explaining that we were flying business class we were told we were not allowed in. Having flown all round the world over the last 20 years many times in business class, we have always had access to lounges. Not according to the American Airlines agent! So after biting our tongues, we eventually got onto the flight to Hawaii. What fun. The cabin service manager was rude and obnoxious. The food was the worst we have ever had, even flying economy. Even telling the Cabin Manager about the food, all she did was pick up the tray and make no comment. There was a young Hawaiian hostess who was sweet and smiled at everyone. So what was the problem with her boss? The seats were uncomfortable even though they were supposedly First Class. We had made the mistake of having front row 1D and 1F and we were so close to the bulkhead we couldn't stretch our legs. Don't have bulkhead seats! Return flight to LAX we changed our seats to non bulkhead which helped with the legroom. Went into the AA lounge in LAX and were greeted nicely and given access. We then asked why we were refused entry before, only to be told that it was a mistake as we had the right to use the lounge! We should have asked to see a supervisor to check our status! Pity they put untrained staff in a business lounge. Having got entry into a lovely quiet and spacious lounge we were disappointed to find a total lack of food except to crackers and cheese. We had been given 3 drink vouchers each so we could get something to drink. Why is it that other airlines give you no restriction on drinks? The next flight was from LAX to LHR on a new Boeing 787. Nice plane and nice business class seats. Hostess were quite attentive but again totally let down by the quality of the food unless you like over cooked steak for dinner and leather scrambled eggs for breakfast! Why is it other airlines can get things right but American Airlines have grumpy staff and absolutely terrible food?"
2777,"London to Los Angeles return with American Airlines. Flights were both on time, planes were clean and comfortable. The IFE was extensive and up-to-date. The food on the LAX-LHR route was good, although the red-eye return haul had a breakfast that I mostly left. When flying into LAX the boarding was a little chaotic - whilst Group 1 boarding were announced, after this no information was given, leaving the rest of us to guess when we went to board. On the flight itself, crew were friendly at first but after about 2-3 hours into the flight they clearly were tired and it reflected on their manner as I felt like I was irritating them every time I asked for a drink when they came down the aisles, which did feel a little intimidating to me. Thankfully, my flight back was much better organised in boarding and crew were very friendly throughout the flight. Overall though my experience was positive and I would fly with American again."
2778,"American Airlines has unsatisfactory customer service, takes advantage of its customers, and is uninterested in building customer loyalty. I have never been so disappointed in a major corporation.  I rarely fly American, but when I do I have the same miserable experience. I planned a vacation for several friends, and I have experienced multiple flight cancellations, changes, and attitude from the American Airlines staff. I would not even classify it as poor customer service, they are simply rude. "
2779,"Will never fly AA again. I was scheduled on a 4pm flight from Sacramento to LAX on Saturday, Oct. 11th. I arrived at 2pm for the flight. It was marked as 'delayed' and re-scheduled for 5:45pm departure.  At about 5pm I moved my seat closer to the gate counter to listen to the staff conversation about updates. They had probably a dozen conversations with maintenance people, pilots, etc  all in hushed tones to one another. Then, when someone would approach the staff, they would rudely say 'we know nothing - you'll have to sit back down and wait'. Super rude to nearly every person who approached to ask. At 7.30pm - after only 1 announcement over a speaker about what is happening, they canceled the flight. A long line of people had been waiting to talk to gate attendants for the last several hours, but most of the attendants were just beyond rude - no information, wouldn't look at people, just kept typing away for hours with nothing actually happening. We run down to the ticketing booths to get our flights re-booked. Of course, by this time there were no other flights to LAX that night. Again, if people had known an hour earlier that the chances were unlikely that they would get to LAX that night, they would have tried to get on another flight. As I wait in line I re-book a flight over the phone in 5 minutes. However, I then need a hotel voucher, as my flight left at 7am. After waiting in line at the ticketing booth for 2.5 hours someone finally provided vouchers to everyone waiting. 7After waiting for hotel shuttle to arrive for 45 minutes, a group of us finally pay for a cab to the hotel. We walk in at 10pm and the lone hotel staffer has no idea that we were coming, and also has no idea what airline vouchers are. They also only have 4 rooms available. As our group finally gets rooms a large group arrives from our plane with vouchers in hand, only to be told there were no rooms available. I'm guessing these people, after spending 8 hours waiting, just went back to the airport to sleep.  Again - things happen, planes get delayed/canceled by nobody's fault. However if the staff had been remotely professional and fore-thinking, they could have got people with important connections on other flights before it was too late. The staff could have communicated at least a few times over the course of hours to everyone, helping to alleviate the confusion and hysteria that grew out of knowing NOTHING. Never again, American Airlines. Folks - look at these reviews and go with another airline!"
2780,"I bought two $750 round trip American Airlines tickets from Newark to Barcelona through Expedia. The websites of Expedia and then American Airlines would not allow me to choose a seat and advised me to call. When I did call American Airlines, I was told I would not be able to choose any seats, much less two seats together so my husband and I could be with each other, until check in at the airport unless I paid $75 more per ticket to guarantee a seat and that unless I paid this extra $150 total we would probably not be able to sit together. I will never fly this airline again."
2781,"Booked two flights online to Chicago at $300 more per ticket than several other airlines because we had a gift certificate we wanted to use. While trying to select our seats, the only seats showing available cost an extra $58 per seat. I called AA and the 'customer service' representative informed me that she could make the seat selection for me, but that would cost an extra $25 per seat. I explained that I was requesting assistance because their website wasn't allowing me to make my selection. She said the only way she could help me without an extra charge was to transfer me to their technical assistance department and, if that person there could not help me, he/she could transfer me back to 'customer service' and authorize a waiver. Then, they could make my seat selection without charging me extra. The person at the technical assistance desk informed me that there were seats available at the quoted price, but that I had to complete my purchase, and select my seats 30 minutes afterward. It actually took eight hours to receive a confirmation, and I still could not make a seat selection. Once again I called 'customer service' and the rep informed me that the only way I could select my seats was to pay an additional $25 dollars per reservation. Otherwise, I needed to wait until the day of departure in order to be assigned seats at the gate. They could not even guarantee that we would be seated together. In light of the ridiculous two-day process of trying to get assigned seating, I asked to speak to a supervisor but was refused any assistance, refused to give me her employee ID (finally gave in after five or six requests), and refused to put me in contact with her supervisor. This is the first and last time I will fly American Airlines. Their flights are over priced and, based on their pathetic lack of any regard for the customer, their staff is over paid. After seeing the other reviews, I have no idea how they are still in business. Apparently, one-star ratings are commonplace for this travesty of an airline."
2782,"I had a pathetic experience travelling American Airlines from London to Miami and back from Chicago to London. They don't just have issues on one or two fronts but multiple ones. Being Indian, I am not used to great customer service but the flight attendants in American Airlines put the ones on Air India to shame. They are rude and do not care about your needs. The entertainment system is the worst and their fleet is so old that the screen size could be trumped by some of the bigger phones in the market. There were a total of 10 movies on the plane and the choices were pathetic. The entertainment system is not personalized and they have shows running like in a cinema hall. So if you miss the show start, you join in between. The food was another issue. I had specifically asked for a AVML (Asian Vegetarian Meal) and they told me that they 'call' it VGML (Vegetarian Meal). Nobody from American told me that it is a simple vanilla vegetarian meal consisting of bread, butter, crackers and pasta when I was expecting some food I am used to. I had called American thrice to confirm this and they told me I am all set.  While I was slated to fly back from Chicago, the aircraft developed brake issues and they had to install new ones. This delayed departure by four hours. Every one hour, American would announce that they will tell us soon but even after boarding, we could not take off for 1.5 hours. This obviously led to me missing connection in London. I am never flying American airlines again. "
2783,"This review concerns the Philly to Manchester leg of of our trip. A customer was able to get onto to the plane with an oversized bag. He refused to check it upon boarding, tried to jam it into the overhead and under his seat. When the flight attendant was also unable to fit the luggage anywhere, the customer was rewarded with a free upgrade to first class. Flight was fine and without issue other than this customer being rewarded for breaking the rules."
2784,"Manchester to New York with American Airlines. Upgraded to main cabin extra for a small fee, and well worth it with much more space. Food adequate. Staff did their job okay but not on par with the Qatar Airways staff I had just flown on. Shame about the poor arrival terminal with long lines for immigration and customs but that's not the airline's fault. Poor entertainment system which didn't matter to me, but my be of concern to others, especially families."
2785,"Today is 7 Oct and wife and I are not in Dominica! Long story, and very sad - we awoke this morning at 2:30 to get the last of the things done around the house necessary to close it for the 6 months we would spend in Dominica. About 3:45 AM, a buddy of mine showed up to take us to the airport. We got to Eppley Airport about 4:30 and had boarding passes about 15 minutes later. Went thru TSA in a breeze – best TSA screening ever for us – very quick. We walked to the departure gate and found a place to sit next to the gate work area. There was activity that early as a flight to Dallas was just before ours. The Dallas flight departed and our flight departure was suddenly changed from 6:05 to 6:59! What gives – no American Airlines rep at the gate would say anything. The only announcement they made was that the crew would be there shortly (25 minutes) (already post departure time). Lynn went to the gate folks and inquired about the flight, particularly because we had a connecting flight in Chicago to SJU. “No Problem” says the guy at the gate – the other flight is late, too, so all is well. You will have plenty of time. Our flight finally boards and departs – well over an hour late. In flight, the pilot announces that the delay was as a result of “crew rest time” as the original crew for this flight got in late the evening before.  We get to Chicago, go like hell to the gate for the SJU flight and get there just in time to see the aircraft preparing to pull away from the terminal. We were not allowed to board as the “door” closed 10 minutes before we got there. At that point, one of the AA reps hands us boarding passes for the next flight to SJU – several hours later. I ask “how about the connecting flight following that one?” Big blank stare, a look of shock on the guy’s face – he never looked to see if there was anything else on our itinerary. Now there is a supervisor involved, both banging away on the keyboards - they have nothing for today as there is only one AA sponsored flight a day into Dominica (DOM). Finally, out of the goodness of their hearts, they offer to put us up in San Juan for the night – but the catch is that the next available seats on Seaborne (AA affiliate) to Dominica are on 15 Oct 2015 –  a week away and they want us to sit in SJU waiting on the AA sponsored flight - then they offer to let us sit in Chicago! I was not happy. It was not our fault that the flight crew was so late getting us out of Omaha. We finally got new ticket vouchers for 15 Oct on the same set of flights as originally set up by Liberty Travel. One small point, our luggage is now missing in action – AA has no idea where it is – they are hunting. And the luggage cost me $50 for this mess. I hope it enjoys the trip. Later, when putting in a “claim” for our AWOL baggage, I find out from an AA employee that AA had no idea the crew was out of flying time and could not even find them in the morning? Had to have the hotel get them. At least that was the story from the ground crew personnel we talked to about the flight. We grab a ride from the airport back home."
2786,I spent almost 2-3 hours of my vacation on hold. When we landed I was told to call American Airlines two days before we left to change seats if they were available. I was told I could do it online. There website is a nightmare. Dis functional and impossible to use if you have an issue. It's impossible to email a representative. The list of questions they want is irrational. The site shut down and crashed on me because it wanted information I didn't have. I was unable to get information on seat upgrades. Then I called them and spent 45 minutes of my vacation on hold. Only to find out that.(this was on top of the 45 minutes I spent when we landed. I tried to upgrade the seats then but was told I needed to wait till two days before we left) so here I am on hold for an hour two days before we leave and they tell me that they cant help me and can't do anything because the seats were booked at an undisclosed rate.  They eventually helped me and scheduled a gentleman to call me. This process took 2-3 hours on the phone and a scheduled call two days later. Unfortunately it's impossible for me to get through to that guy from Ireland. The level of disgust I have is beyond words to describe and all I was trying to do is pay them to upgrade a seat to business class?
2787,"I had booked American Airlines travel in advance for myself and family well in advance of our trip at a fairly decent rate. a month before travel, the airline removed a flight from our plan. After trying to find a flight to get us home, I booked one with Southwest (who I've never had issues with, props to them), and asked for a partial refund of the flight I wasn't taking with them. They refused. Gave me the run around with customer relations, then got told to request a partial refund with the refunds department, which I did, and then all my flights were canceled. I was then forced to rebook my trip at a higher cost of course. All the while, the admitted that their refunds department should not have canceled my flights. This trip ended up costing me almost $1000 more than my original booking. They didn't care. I waited until I returned from my trip to request again the money I'm out. After writing 6 letters to the top 6 executives with AA, I once again received a customer relations email (auto-response) that tells me I again, won't be granted a refund. I had asked for phone call or email from them.  I can't even fathom how much money over the years they have taken from their customers by doing this. I will never recommend this airline."
2788,"A short flight from Tampa to Miami with American Airlines. Only 40 minutes long, so no service on board but clean and comfortable plane especially as it was a full flight. Friendly and informative staff too. Would have no hesitation in flying again."
2789,"My adult son, who is visually impaired, travelled alone for the first time and booked assistance on his American Airlines flights from Manchester to Pittsburgh via Philadelphia. He was looked after at every point of the flights. Thank you for looking after him."
2790,"Flight# 1281 was scheduled to leave O'Hare at 10.10 am en route to Seattle. As soon as I got through security, the departure board was now showing a delay. There were no weather issues whatsoever. The flight was rescheduled to depart at 11.35 am, and the gate had changed. Within minutes of arriving at the gate, the gate changed again, then again. The flight was then pushed back to 12.05 pm. Two hours past the scheduled departure time, we began boarding the flight. Not one American employee apologized for the inconvenience or explained the delay. I was miffed. I understand the American employees staffed at O'Hare were not to blame for the delay, but it would have been nice to recognize the delay was a huge inconvenience. Two days later, I received an email from American, asking me to review my flight from O'Hare to BWI. It was laughable. They couldn't even get my itinerary correct to review. In the future, I will bite the bullet and head towards Midway where at least Southwest has a far better on-time rating and employees that seem to care."
2791,"The American Airlines service was ridiculous, not only were the flight attendants rude, but then the airline loses my bag that they made me check at the gate. When I landed and told them about my bag they said it would take a total of one to five days to get it back. It has now been five days, and they haven't even come close to finding my bag. It literally had my name on every side of it, and my name and address on 2 tags. They forced me to check this bag. Don't even try calling their customer service, the people are rude and extremely unhelpful. Each of them told me different things and none of them lined up with what the other people said. American Airlines must hate their customers."
2792,"My wife and I flew American Airlines from Miami to Maui through LAX on the way over. On the return trip back we had to return through Dallas Fort Worth. The issue is our originally scheduled flight was supposed to have an hour or so layover in Dallas Fort Worth and arrive in Miami at 11 am. However, American changed this flight to leave two hours later with a layover now closer to 4 hours and an arrival time in Miami of 1 pm. There was a flight that would leave 1 hour earlier than the original, but apparently we were defaulted to the worse one. Thanks American for ruining our return trip. You did not notify us of the change when it occurred. We only found out at checkin and were presented with no better options until we reviewed them on our own. When we inquired of the gate attendant to get on the earlier flight, we were told that our bags would arrive at the later time regardless, and there would be a $75 pp transfer fee. Nice and classy move American. Last time I fly with second class American Airlines. "
2793,"I flew American Airlines last December and had an awful experience. Every one of my flights was delayed on the tarmac for at least 30 minutes. I almost missed a connecting flight and had a flight attendant yell at me for asking her a question. The flight was also very cramped. I swore I would never fly American again but I found a great deal recently and I thought I would give them another chance. I purchased travel insurance just in case and was ready to go. Unfortunately I just lost my job and when I called to cancel the flight I was told that there was a $200 service fee. She then explained that since my flight was less than that, I would just lose that money and not have to pay anything extra. When I told her that I would never be flying American Airlines again she got very rude and short with me. Apparently customer service isn't a priority for American Airlines. I will never use them to travel again and I don't recommend it for anyone else."
2794,"This was my 3rd American Airlines flight this week - returning home after seeing my 5 week old grandson for the first time. Again this was the same type of aircraft as the outbound flight. The ground staff were very nice and cabin crew pleasant and efficient. My hot entrée was on board and the meal very tasty. Again, my only complaint was the in ceiling screens - couldn't really see all that well. I didn't even bother using the ear buds at my seat. forgot to mention, blanket was also at the seat upon boarding - as well as my 2 outbound flights. Nothing extraordinary - just friendly, professional service."
2795,After going to an American Airlines counter at DFW to ask a simple question about my bag I was shocked to see how fast everyone wanted to pass the buck. I always thought Air Canada was bad but the staff at DFW with American airlines was awful. The flight attendants were rude onboard and the service was non existent. Will not be flying American again!
2796,"This is where my 4 flights of the week went downhill. First off, American Airlines changed the plane from a great A321 type that I flew out on to an old B757 - a much larger and much older aircraft. I thought I was sent back via the Twilight Zone. I hadn't flown in one of these in years! Anyway, pillow and blanket (neither of which I used) were at our seats. The seats were large but there wasn't any regular plugs to charge devices. Again, it was a 2 hour flight so no meal - just a choice of refreshments.  Entertainment was provided via overhead CRT monitors anchored to the ceiling over the aisle. CRT monitors! The ground crew were very good and organized since there were many people at the desk due to the change in aircraft. Luckily, my reserved seat was still mine - just not in the nicer A321. The cabin crew were younger but friendly and professional. The captain was funny on the PA system.  Overall and okay flight but thankfully short."
2797,I was amazed at the attention we received from our cabin attendant. She obviously has been flying for a while and she had this down pat. She introduced herself to each passenger as we boarded. We were served a drink and the warm nuts. I had placed my entrée order online and it was there for me - and very tasty. The seat was comfortable. My only concern was the plane having only the overhead screens instead of individual seatback screens. All in all it was very enjoyable trip.
2798,"I would never consider flying American Airlines but I had no choice so booked the ticket for the exit door. Being 15 and aware of the airline rules booked the seat -  when I arrived at the airport they said that I couldn't sit at the emergency exit. When I showed them the website and the rules they disregarded me and gave me a seat with less legroom. Being tall this was not the best way to go but I took the seat. Onboard plane it was filthy, no entertainment. We received an option of a banana or pretzels, a tiny cup of water and that was it. When II asked for more water he looked at me sarcastically. Premium economy had little extra legroom and not worth the upgrade."
2799,"Traveled American Airlines on 29th September and happy with the flight. Ground staff and cabin crew were professional and friendly. This was a newer A321 with good seats and 15 inch seat back screens with a wide variety of programing. It was a short flight with only refreshments served, but sufficient. "
2800,"I am horrified by how American Airlines tried to take advantage of a bad situation in the Bahamas to try and charge me £800 pounds for a one way flight of max 45 minutes duration, when I wanted to change my flight due to the hurricane from Saturday to Thursday. As a gold card member of oneworld alliance I will go out of my way never to fly with them again - totally unacceptable."
2801,"I have flown with American Airlines for years. I have changed to Delta and was given the same status I had with American. The reason I transitioned was a complete lack of customer service from American Airlines. My flight was delayed and I was going to miss my connecting. I called the AAadvantage desk. They told me they would put me on a 5:30 AM flight so I could get to Dallas for a 6:05 PM flight to get home. I asked for a later flight. The rep told me they had to put me on the next available flight. I asked to speak to a supervisor. This is where it gets good. The rep told me he would leave a message for the supervisor. They might call me back within two hours. If I was not contacted within two hours I could call back and ask again. If not contacted within two hours I could call back and request again. I could follow this pattern until I was called back. I asked to speak to customer service. They told me I could email customer service and they would reply back in a couple weeks. This week I flew Delta - I called the Skymiles desk and asked to speak with customer service. I was connected to a person. Goodbye American, hello Delta"
2802,"Upon arrival in DFW, I was informed they lost my bag. I had come to DFW a day early to ensure that I had enough time. I was told the bag would be delivered to the hotel. I checked via phone after the said time the bag was to arrive and I was told they could not locate the bag. I checked again later and was told to pick up the bag at the airport. At the airport, I was told they did not know where the bag was and there was nothing they could do for me. I went back to the hotel and that night the bag was delivered. I will never check at bag again. "
2803,"We booked our American Airlines flight in March for my nieces wedding and were scheduled to depart Kansas City at 6:05 am. At 4:00 am we were notified that the flight was delayed to 9:00 then noon. Our connection to Cabo was at 8:47 and the only other connection was 10:40 and it was full. They could not find us a flight with American or United, the only carrier they are contracted with until 4 days later. Said they could send us to somewhere as close as 300 miles away from Cabo. Exactly what I want to do, get dropped in the middle of Mexico and find my own way through the jungle to reach my vacation destination. Reason for delay was maintenance. Only option - refund and cancel trip. Very rude service, treated as if we were a number. This has also happened to friends of ours. I will never book with American Airlines again. If it's my only option, I just won't go! Only reason for 1 star is it won't allow me to post zero!"
2804,"My flight from JFK to CVG was continuously delayed, then cancelled, then reinstated, then delayed and then we finally got on. After 8+ hours they still didn't manage to get my bag on board, and no bagage service agent was to be found at CVG. Called 800 number, talked to an agent who promised it would be there the following day at noon.. Called to confirm today, AA didn't even have a flight coming in before 5, and the claim was never even registered with the company! Trying to have the bag flown from JFK to CVG is proving to be even more of a hassle than waiting 8+ hours. No one can help, and are giving us attitude as we are trying to be very understanding - ie. driving the hour from our house to go pick the bag up ourselves at CVG. I can't explain the situation to the point of understanding, but I will never fly American Airlines again in my life if I can avoid it. Sure the flight was cheap, and I now understand why. I have never encountered such unprofessionalism in a big airline, and I will do my best to spread the word."
2805,Had an excellent experience from Palm Springs to Washington DC return during September. I had not flown American Airlines for a few years and amazed at the improved quality of the First Class domestic product. All flights were on time with connections at DFW. The inflight service was excellent and the friendliness of the team surpassed expectations. 
2806,"I was visiting Miami for an academic conference. My colleagues arrived to MIA a bit late due to traffic issues/flooding. We arrived to the airport around 55 min before our departure on AA1265 to PHL. With no bags to check, we proceeded to security where I noticed that my boarding pass would not load on either the mobile app nor via the browser. I told my colleagues to go through security without me, and went to a nearby American Airlines kiosk to print my ticket. It did not work. I tried another kiosk which printed an error ticket, directing me to the counter. I did check-in from home earlier that day and had a reserved seat on this flight. Aware of the lack of time, I informed the check-in line rep of the situation, who referred me to the supervisor. She understood my situation but insisted I wait in the bag check line to print my ticket, despite 0 bags to check. When I said the delay would cause me to miss my flight she unsympathetically told me that I should have arrived 2 hrs early and walked away dismissively. At the counter, the agent printed my ticket easily with no explanation as to why it didn't work on my phone or from the kiosk. I went through security and sprinted to my gate, only to miss it by a few moments (walkway still attached), both of my colleagues aboard. Rebooking was apathetic and booked me standby for 7am. American Airlines has the worst customer treatment and I will never fly AA again."
2807,"American Airlines makes it almost impossible to speak with anyone in person, and now I know why. They do not want to be held responsible for any part of your flight experience which they did not provide well - which for me, was just about every one. The mechanics of the plane, quality of the flight attendant service, timeliness of the flight, etc. My son was smacked with the tray table from the seat in front of me repeatedly and no one cared to do anything about it. I finally just left it open so it could stop randomly falling on my infant (3 months old at the time). The flight attendant got annoyed and said I had to close it and I told her I would just as soon as she figured out how to get it to stop hurting my baby. She was rude and said she didn't know and didn't even apologize. Clearly, all they care about is taking your from Destination A to B, regardless if you get there in one piece or not.  If you get on the plane, then they have done their job, according to them. Do not fly with them if time or safety are your priority."
2808,"In Florida the American Airlines plane I was flying had mechanical problems which made us an hour late getting into Philly. I missed my connecting flight. I had to stand in the customer service line for 90 min only to be put on the next flight going out the next day. There allotment of hotels was out so I guess I was supposed to sleep in the airport, and some did. They would not help find a hotel, I was denied help when asking for transportation through the airport due to a disability. I ended up finding a hotel nearby and grabbing hotel transport. I was charged $172 for the night. After contacting customer service, in the end they gave me 10,000 points (which is worthless) and $79 towards my hotel. Thanks for nothing. I fly a lot and it will not be with American Airlines again!! They are a huge disappointment and unfair practices."
2809,"Someone else booked me this American Airlines flight, and I will never make the same mistake. I was taking the Red Eye back home to Boston, needing to make my connecting flight from LAX to BOS. Not only was my first flight delayed, from SAC I had to add another connecting through Chicago which they promised me was the earliest flight, but then ended up having to wait 3 hours in the airport. American Airlines customer service was abysmal and the whole trip was stressful and unproductive. Would not recommend."
2810,"So displeased with the customer service American Airlines serves. I booked a flight through one account with my boyfriend two months ago leaving from two different locations but meeting in Miami to connect. His first flight was delayed due to crew issues, which then had his connection put on another later flight to Panama. AA said there were many seats on the second flight but it would cost me 200$ for switching. Even though it was a mess up on their end, I tried to address it nicely but they refused to work with me. They don't care. Sat at Panama airport waiting for him. I refuse to fly with this airline again. I've never had issues with Southwest when I had to cancel my flight with full refund. American Airlines just wants your money and not your satisfaction."
2811,"Las Vegas to Miami via Los Angeles. The A321 is quiet aircraft, comfortable seats, wonderful spacing and inflight entertainment system. Crew was exceptionally professional on the first short flight and the A321 to Miami. Food selection was good. Captains informative especially deviating around weather. Returned to DFW on refurbished Boeing 777-200 and to LAS on new Boeing 737-800, again fabulous flights. Sat on ground in MIA with baggage and weather delays and Captain informed passengers of status. Missed DFW connection, but my AA app revised flight all figured out as we landed. New Boeing 777-200 interior is beautiful, loved the mood lighting. Once again, service was great and crew very professional."
2812,Second time this year American Airlines has changed my flight causing me and my wife to be seated separately on the new flight. The only seats available next to each other were premium seats that they were requiring me to pay for. Fist time was our 35th wedding anniversary. Never again.
2813,"American Airlines ground handling at Heathrow is slapdash, disappointing considering it's AA's own staff. Despite having Oneworld Elite status, no priority tags, explanation of lounge options or recognition at check-in or boarding gate (use of my name just once would have been nice). Used the British Airways lounge, and it was fine for a coffee and afternoon tea. Boarding at LHR chaotic. Onboard, the crew were friendly and jovial, the new Business Class seat is comfy, lots of storage, great IFE and Bose headsets. Wifi did dropout numerous times. The dining was second to none, compared to British Airways where a tray is thrown at you in Club World and the main course in overcooked and swimming in liquid. I have not flown in Economy with American Airlines transatlantic yet, but Business Class exceeded my expectations, and with their new product they exceed BA by miles. Looking forward to American Airlines and this aircraft on the SYD-LAX route."
2814,"American Airlines is hit and miss on most flights. Sometimes great service, sometimes not so great. They should have longer turnaround times in London Heathrow, because I often take their flights from there to LAX/JFK and the planes are dirty. This time, I opened up my screen at row 16 and there was food, drinks and everything else on the screen. The table dirt was the same. Seats had food bits in them. This flight was okay, food was better. Planes are packed these days, so even as Exec Plat, I had no chance of the system wide upgrade."
2815,"American Airlines cancelled my ticket without notice, then overbooked the new flight delaying me 5 hours on the beginning of my trip. They then did the exact same thing on the return. Horrible customer service. I asked to speak with a manager and the lady sent me to Alaska Airlines, and I had to call the 800 number to talk to anyone associated with American Airlines. I'm canceling my next 2 flights and moving to another airline."
2816,"We booked a flight with British Airways, but it was actually American airlines that we travelled with. I have flown with quite a few airlines in the past and never came across such rude staff. The staff in Manchester Airport were lovely but the American Airlines flight attendants were extremely rude. On the return flight a smile never crossed their faces. Sullen, miserable and very very rude, flown with them once and would never fly with them again."
2817,"La Guardia to San Jose via Miami with American Airlines. The ground service was ok, and the flights were on time. The p[lanes are a bit old, and American still uses the olds 737 on this route. The transfer connection in Miami fast and easy. However, the downside is that American Airlines FA's are not interested on offering a good service. Not even a smile."
2818,"On our way to Barbados Airport we got an automated phone message from American Airlines that our flight was delayed by two hours. This delay meant we had a slim chance to make our connecting flight home. The flight to MIA was good, pilots knew there were a lot of passengers who needed to transfer at MIA and gave a lot of information. Although cabin crew offered a drink service (many of which you need to pay for) only once, they did everything in their power to assist passengers making connecting flights. Unfortunately we missed our connection due to the unwillingness of American Airlines check-in staff to help us, and spent the night at MIA. The cabin interior on this flight was modern and seats comfortable for a 4 hour flight."
2819,"Sadly I read these reviews of American Airlines, aircraft and route after I had booked. I can confirm what others say. Old planes, older cabin attendants and a Mickey Mouse type service by crew. No seat back entertainment centre, only central screen every 5/6 rows and programmes started before headsets even given out. Could hardly see the screens. Food absolutely terrible, especially on return leg to UK. Really cold on the flights.  Our return flight was over the Atlantic when a warning light came on and the Captain returned to JFK. You could hear the alarm screeching in the background of his speech to the passengers. Escorted to stand by Fire Service after brakes checked. Second worst landing I have ever had in 45 years of flying.  The landing in the replacement plane by the same pilot was only marginally better. The airline industry has moved on, especially the Middle East carriers, but American Airlines has not. I paid more for these 6/7 hour flights than I do for 14 hour flights to Asia. Pay a bit more and get a proper airline next time. Like many other reviewers on this and other sites, I will never use American Airlines again."
2820,"I've flown on different US airlines and American Airlines was the worst. Ready to board the Boeing  767 on our 4 hour flight to Barbados, I saw a good looking aircraft. New paint and equipped with modern wingtips. The interior however was extremely outdated and worn. No IFE and one moment of inflight service (with everything practically costing money). The cabin crew was adequate. The flight was full and service practically non-existent. The aircraft departed with a delay and arrived at Barbados later than scheduled. The drop-off in service and airline/aircraft quality compared to our previous flight was huge. "
2821,"Boston to New York JFK on American Airlines Boeing 737-800. Plane was retrofitted with new seats. Obviously makes the travel much better, as although tighter on pitch, the slimmer profile allows a certain amount of comfort. Flight time was not enough to make purchasing TV content worth it. May have been a moving map available for free. Given the revenue on the Northeast corridor routes, the upgraded plane makes sense, but not sure how much charging for TV is worth attempting to charge for compared to others where it is free."
2822,"Dallas/Ft Worth to Boston on an old American Airlines Boeing 757. Thankfully I was tired enough to sleep the majority of the time. There are center aisle ceiling TVs showing something which I couldn't see that well from the window seat anyway. Woke up around a period when they served drinks. Requested an orange juice, and the attendant dropped the box next to the person in the aisle in the row behind. I couldn't see how the box was dropped, but she then picked it up and proceeded to pour my drink! How disgusting! And poor girl behind. Flight was packed, as you get connecting through a hub dominated by one airline. Benefit of the old Boeing 757 is that the seats were fairly wide and comfortable, despite age."
2823,"Wish I could rate American Airlines 0/10. Do not get the AA Advantage Card. There are barely any advantages. Fine print seems to be what American Airlines is all about with its loyalty program. We booked a multi-city trip with up to 8 days in a layover with our AA Advantage card, expecting to be charged for baggage on our international legs of the flight. But since we have the AA Advantage card, the domestic check is supposed to be free for the first bag for each person, up to 4, on the reservation. Well, American Airlines charged us for checked bags at every point. The agents claimed that we would have to call Customer Service to get reimbursed. Customer Service said that they could not do anything, so we have to go to the online site and leave a complaint. The American Airlines representative left a terse email stating that since all our flights were booked on the same itinerary, which included an international leg, we had to pay for checked baggage on every flight. We flew to 4 different cities in the US over the space of 2.5 weeks and were charged every time for baggage. What is supposed to be a benefit of our card that charges a $95 annual fee! So American is saying that we need to divide our travel reservation into international and domestic portions when purchasing our tickets in order to enjoy a complementary checked bag. The only perk: get 5% off if you buy the poor excuses for refreshments on American flights."
2824,"American Airlines ticket counter in Boston is severely understaffed and grossly mis-managed. Arrived at the ticket counter area the pre-requisite 90 minutes prior to domestic flight time. Three or four AA agents checking in approximately 200+ people at the same time. Total chaos. No organization, no expedited lines. Complaints to AA go for naught. Had to fly out 5 days later and pay over $1,100 in change fees and airfare increases. If you fly American Airlines out of Boston on 5am flights, you better get to the airport at 2:30am or earlier."
2825,Horrible. Every American Airlines staff member (except two of the flight attendants) were extremely rude and unhelpful. Not to mention when our flight was delayed - no one helped us get another flight. When we missed our connection we had to look up our own flight and physically take the details to the desk and show them there was space. Bag checks are 25$ each which is pretty ridiculous as well. Will not be flying with American Airlines again.
2826,"From the disinterested American Airlines gate agents who did not care to even figure out your problem, to crew onboard who exhibited awful attitudes and service - and then were shocked when you did not immediately fall over yourself thanking them for their poor service and almost uniform misinformation, American Airlines is awful. We recently took a long honeymoon trip out of the country and American Airlines lack of concern, poor attitude, and abysmal customer service frustrated us at almost every turn. My spouse travels quite a bit for her job and accrues AA points regularly. I will not fly this airline again. "
2827,"I left Maui at 9:30 pm to head back to Michigan. Unfortunately flying back I have a 6 hour wait at airport in Chicago. They charge $75 to change your flight time to a earlier flight which I was willing to do. What they don't tell you is you can only change to times they already picked! I found a flight on American Airlines that would have me at the airport for only 2 hours waiting but customer service said that the flight I wanted was not one of the choices, and if I wanted to go on that flight it would be $400 extra. I could drive back home from Chicago in a rented car and it be less than that! Then arriving to the airport I found out I could change my flight and be standby for $75. I was put on the list as number 8 and was not able to catch the earlier flight. "
2828,"What is happening with American Airlines? Worst aircraft I have ever been on for an international flight. I am Exec Plat, One World Emerald. Cabin staff pleasant but plane was ridiculous. I was in Exit row and fold out table was so old it dangled at an angle and I had to use a newspaper to prop it up. Rubbish single aisle TV so no personal media options. AA is not keeping its side of the One World agreement. This would never happen on BA and Qantas. I thought the merger with US would make AA better. Feels like they are a budget airline charging full service. I am thinking of switching to Delta."
2829,"Very poor service from American Airlines. Flight from Laredo to Dallas was delayed 3 hours. No apology, no attempt to provide even a soft drink during the wait. Had to practically beg them to reschedule the connection. Missed a very important connection because of this delay. Very dissatisfied."
2830,"Las Vegas to London Heathrow via LAX, and I initially booked this fight with a 2 hour changeover in LAX. I had concerns when received an email from American Airlines advising of 45 minute changeover, I sent several emails advising of concern, their response was to request I call them in USA. I find it strange that a company that you are paying good money to, contacts you by one option but then you have to contact them by another, I feel this needs to be addressed, I never in the end used the phone as I have had to do this with other airlines wasting time and money and just hoped all would work out. Checked in at Las vegas 3 hours before flight and was told there was no Business Lounge for American Airlines, strange as their main competitor has one and there are other lounges which you can pay to go into, why does AA not do this? The internal flight to LAX was ok, plenty of legroom in Business seats with some recline, we were provided with a bag of chips and a drink. Changeover at LAX was very efficient, arrived at gate next to where we had to get our plane to LHR, arrived with 10 minutes until boarding started. Boarded plane with no greeting from cabin staff they seemed to be engaged in conversation with each other, this caused issues when seating as my wife had to go all the way back to the front. Seat was a great set up, same as Cathay Pacific. Good seat storage, good choice of movies on large screen and comfortable seat and bed, although those over 6 foot might find ther feet feel restricted with limited foot space when in lie flat mode. Cabin staff were efficient and professional although they were not vey welcoming and did not smile - I managed after many contacts to get a smile from a hostess, but it seems to me that most do not want to be doing this job? It is strange that American Airlines would not choose to focus more on customer service especially as this is their new flagship plane. Suitcaes arrived at detination which was good. Overall experience was reasonable with food and seating being the best part of the experience."
2831,"On both outbound and return trip with American Airlines from Los Angeles to London Heathrow, there were couples including ourselves who had been placed automatically into slightly suboptimal seating arrangements eg across an aisle or with a singleton between them or in different rows in close proximity. This encourages you to pay extra so you can sit together on a long flight. I am suspicious that they do this deliberately, and if so, this is a particularly cheap and dirty trick. Also, we were placed in the rearmost row, meaning you get no choice of meal when they run out of one meal option. When I asked if this is going to happen for every meal for the whole flight, the attendant was rude and said, of course - hadn't I ever flown before? An apology would have sufficed. We found the staff dismissive, talking amongst themselves while customers were disembarking instead of saying goodbye like they do on other airlines. They're clearly not a quality liner, and we won't be looking to fly with them again."
2832,"Received an email notification that our American Airlines JFK-SJU flight was delayed 3 hours, had to inform the Premium Check-in Desk Agent myself. At gate, was told that a new aircraft was being flown in. After waiting 3 hours was told that the aircraft was used for another flight instead. Re-routed via MIA on flight that got us to SJU seven hours later, which meant we missed an entire day of vacation. After asking about our bags (nobody communicated anything prior) had to reclaim bags and recheck with just 30 mins before MIA flight departed. On MIA flight, they knowingly put our 12-year-old in an emergency row (against FAA policy). Lack of communication, surly agents, cramped flights. American Airlines seems to be going down the tubes."
2833,"Amazingly, no issues with both flights on American Airlines. Flight from MIA-DFW left on time. Boeing 777 is a great aircraft, the economy seats seem to be less cramped and overall flying experience is nice. Flight from DFW to YVR also on time, and the flight was full of people coughing and sneezing. I thought for sure I would get sick, but I didnt. That's obviously not the fault of the airline! The airline staff pleasant. I got what I paid for, a basic flight that took off and landed on time, all luggage arrived, no issues or problems."
2834,"I have many complaints about my first class trip with American Airlines this month from La Guardia to Charlotte, which were all answered with a canned response from American Airlines. I was most appalled by the filthy and run-down condition of the plane interior from on this flight. Since AA did not respond to my request to provide them with this photo of my first class armrest, perhaps they will view it here."
2835,"I have only flown American Airlines twice, once in 2012 and now in 2015. On both occasions I felt that staff interaction with me was simply in bad taste. On this most recent flight from Palm Beach to Dallas Ft Worth, I was delayed by staff at the counter because he wasn't sure about how to proceed with a passenger with an international destination. As soon as I told him my final destination was Cambodia, the look that came over face told me things might get bumpy (mind you this is in South Florida and they probably don't even know where Cambodia is). Nevertheless, after looking at my passport, he felt the need to get his manager. She comes out and tells me my visa is expired. Indeed, it was expired but she was looking at my Vietnamese visa. At this point I'm upset because I'm thinking, why are these people trying to stop me from getting on this flight? They were acting as if I just woke up that morning and decided I wanted to leave the country. I finally explained to the manager that American citizens can get a visa-on-arrival once they arrive in Cambodia. After she check on the internet to confirm, she issued my boarding pass and let me be on my way. The international leg of the trip from Dallas/Ft Worth was handled by Qatar Airways (who I love) so did we really need to go through all that? Back in 2012 I was sitting in First class and just before take-off, the attendant serving the first-class cabin comes to me, of all people, and asks “Where are you supposed to be sitting”? I was befuddled by her question because I was irrefutably sitting in my assigned seat! I don’t want to jump to conclusions but could her questing have been prompted by the fact that I look more like the average basketball player than the average businessman."
2836,"If I could give American Airlines zero stars I would, but the lowest I can go is a 1/10. Terrible and stressful experience! Worst airline I been on in years. We took a 7 day trip to Turks And Caicos in August. We arrived at Logan International Airport for our flight on August 27 to find out it has been cancelled. I was so irritated and we had to scramble to find another flight, deciding whether or not we would take another flight the next day or book another flight on the same day. Then we decided to book another flight to Chicago. We had to fly to 2 places before we officially got to Turks And Caicos! From Boston to Chicago then from Chicago to Miami and then from Miami to Turks And Caicos! Absolutely terrible. As if this wasn't bad enough, the planes were extremely old, and it looks as though they haven't been cleaned in a long time. Interior of the planes we flew were worn out, dusty and grimy. No personal TV's. The only TV's were those old fashioned TV's hanging from the ceiling every few rows that are largely defunct nowadays I was sitting pretty far away and couldn't even watch what was on there. Seats were old, worn out and very uncomfortable. Food was just terrible. Flight attendants were rude and had a bad attitude, making the flight even more miserable. The bathrooms were small and dirty. The return flight was somewhat better, but still quite unpleasant. We had to go the same route all over again. American Airlines is among the worst airline I have traveled. "
2837,"La Paz to London Heathrow via Miami with American Airlines. This was the worst journey ever. Disgusting staff attitude, no personal TV and terrible food. Missed our connection in Miami but their staff couldn't care less. It took us hours to get them to work with us and give us somewhere to stay overnight. We were told we missed the connection due to bad weather conditions, and apparently bad weather conditions is the fault of the passenger! Most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Cabin crew just seemed like they couldnt be bothered and were rolling their eyes at passengers, signing loudly and treated us very badly. Two staff members even had an argument in front of passengers. So unprofessional. Never fly with American Airlines, they make your journeys thoroughly unpleasant."
2838,"I would give American Airlines no stars if possible, our flight was delayed for a mechanical issue last minute (even though the plane was sitting outside the terminal for 3 hours before the flight). Our delay continued as the pilot informed us we could not leave until the log was signed, that took another 30 minutes. We expressed concern about making our connecting flight, they told us it would be fine. It was not fine, we missed the flight, we landed at 7:00 am in Dallas, the flight was scheduled for a 7:05am take off, they left early at 6:58am. We were sent to 3 different gates trying to get on flights, had to rush with our bags all over the airport and finally had to settle for flying into Reagan rather than BWI where our car was. We agreed to this because the 2 women working with us said the airline would reimburse us the $55 shuttle ride if we wrote to them,. We were not offered a voucher for food at the airport or for a shuttle like we saw other customers being offered. I was just informed by customer service that they will not reimburse as it is not their policy, but they did try to give us two $100 vouchers to use on a future flight. If I was going to fly anywhere within the 1 year they give us to use them, I would not be doing it with American Airlines and $100 will not get you far with their prices. Do yourself a favor and go with a different airline. On top of all this they will put you in the oldest plane they can find for a 7 plus hour trip to and from Hawaii, and no WiFi of course."
2839,"The American Airlines plane was old, dirty and horrid. Birmingham to JFK was a new flight started in May 2015 and they must have taken this plane from the scrap heap. They boarded us on time but sat us on the plane for 2 hours - nothing offered. Finally get going and actually make up a bit of time but then waited on tarmac at JFK for another 1.5hrs. Did we have to rush to get a connecting flight to Orlando. Security at JFK is a nightmare and we got on plane with minutes to spare. Closed the door, taxi out but then everything stopped and sat for another 1.5hrs. Got to Orlando, circle over Daytona for 1 hour land and then yet more time waiting to get to the terminal.  We left UK at 0600, and arrived Orlando at midnight. 18 hours on the plane - never again."
2840,"American Airlines from Miami to Milan. This is probably the worst travel experience I can state, to date. The aircraft was extremely old. I arrive to my business class seat with my daughter, it felt like we were on a flight in a third world country and instead of the screen being behind the seat, I was given an old, breaking tablet with some blue tape wrap around the charger (Photo), which cause the tablet to be almost dead throughout this flight. Next we have the bathroom, which I will say is the worst! It was so tight and dirty.  The food was disgusting and sloppy (Photo). The seat in front of me, the trim was lifting and not even attach to the seat(Photo).  Where I was seating exactly, the air vent was without the turning knob to adjust - just 2 holes! Everything was dirty and I wouldn't recommend American Airlines to anyone."
2841,"I am totally fed up with American Airlines. AA1021 departed Las Vegas without incident and on time. The flight to Dallas/Ft. Worth is only about 2 hours. The A320 can easily fly for over 4 hours. While over Wichita Falls, the pilot announces that he is low on fuel and has to divert to Wichita Falls. Later, the pilot comes over the intercom and tries to explain that it is because of weather around Dallas. Savvy passengers on the flight check this and find there are no current delays at DFW. Why does he not have enough reserve fuel? Maybe the FAA should look into this. Needless to say, we missed our connecting flight to Richmond from Dallas. American Airlines had only 2 customer service reps to process about 125 angry passengers. It was after midnight when we got our new airlines tickets for our continuing flight. Our flight was 9:30AM the next day. American Airlines offered us a hotel, but at our own expense. No food vouchers were ever offered. American Airlines left us stranded waiting for our next flight. This was not the passengers fault. Just saying sorry just doesn't hack it. So this is the new American Airlines? I'm not impressed."
2842,"Minneapolis to Chicago on American Airlines, in Economy class on a vintage MD80. Friendly check-in, where the agent worked with me to avoid the USD 100 surcharge because my hold luggage was initially 8 lbs over American Airlines 50 lbs. limit. This was appreciated. After that the experience became distinctly mediocre. Once boarding was completed the pilot announced that there will be delay due to a maintenance issue that they have not been aware of before. So a packed plane waited for the maintenance issue to be solved, which thankfully “only” lasted 40 minutes. Plane has obviously not been cleaned in MSP, as the seat pocket was full of stuff including used tissues and something sticky and disgusting.  Otherwise the flight was uneventful. Legroom was ok due to Economy ExtrAA seats, but service was very average. Flight attendants not exactly unpleasant, but not particularly friendly, either and not doing more than the absolute minimum. No snacks were served (also not expected as this being the US and the flight time was below 90 minutes). Drink service was limited to coffee, water and orange juice, which is pretty poor for a flight of this duration. Bags out fast in ORD with priority bags first. In general the flight as such was OK. Pretty much like taking a bus. However, due to the delay a lot of people were very anxious to reach their connection out of ORD. The only assistance from American Airlines staff seemed to be an announcement to “remain seated, if you do not have a transfer connection to catch”. Sorry state of affairs in the US skies, but American Airlines is still my default airline for domestic flights, as staff normally seem to be willing to assist, if help is needed."
2843,"This flight from New York JFK to Las Vegas was a reward flight using frequent flyer miles, so only cost $10 for me and my partner. However, we were very disappointed with American Airlines service. The flight was delayed from leaving the gate due to a paperwork issue, but the cabin attendants did not do anything to ease our discomfort (the plane was getting hot due to reduced air con while still at the gate). After we got airbourne (2 hours late) the trolley came around with refreshments, but most food items had sold out completely (only nuts or chips remained). We were seated mid aircraft so feel there was never anywhere near enough food in their stock for this 6 hour flight. Also, the trolley only came around once which is not enough on this length of flight in my opinion."
2844,"I ordered a round trip ticket from American Airlines. I revived no confirmation email from them so when it got closer to the flight I had to talk to the customer services. I had an emergency where I could not make the first leg of the flight and they were not cooperative with changing my ticket they suggested I had to pay at ""$200"" plus the fare difference which totaled $600 - so I booked an alternative airline. When I tried to use the return trip of the American Airlines flight they told me it had been canceled because I did not fly the first leg of the flight. My advice would be to pay careful attention to your ticket servicing."
2845,"In August we flew to Hawaii with American. We had first class tickets and we have to say that we are very disappointed with the experience. It is a 5.5 hour flight (like JFK - London) and the first class seats barely recline. Not even a footrest! Now many airlines even on the longer domestic flights have sleeper seats. We usually don't care about the food on the plane, we don't wait to fly to get a good meal, but on the flight from Kona to Lax when asked if ""pizza"" was ok, my husband asked what was the other choice and the answer was ""pizza only""!  At least don't call it First Class. We will never fly American again if we have other choices."
2846,"I was forced to fly from Orlando to Dallas/Fort Worth just get back to Pensacola. It doesn't make any sense to fly over my city just to get back to my city and add four hours. I accepted it and moved on. The reason why I am writing this review is because I arrived at Ft Worth about 15 minutes later than the flight expected. things happen, and I understand that. But when I arrived I almost immediately heard my name over the intercom for a final boarding call to Pensacola. I was told I had 10 minutes to reach the gate or I wouldn't make it. I made it to the gate I was instructed to reach in less than 3 mins. It was the wrong gate. They told me the incorrect gate both on the plane and over the intercom. SO when I finally found airport staff they told me the correct gate. Luckily it was just a few down. I got to it with more than five minutes to spare in my 10 minute time I was given. I walked up to three personnel from American Airlines and they didn't even want to break out of their personal conversation to help me. When I said ""I heard my name, I'm here to get on"" they told me they had just closed the gate and that I would need to be re-booked. The girl who locked me out of the flight didn't even want to help me get re-booked. She pawned it off to another employee as if it was a chore. He didn't even look me in the face the entire time and told me that I would need to fly at 8.30 that night if I wanted to fly today. I asked how to file a complaint. All he said was ""go online"". I will not be flying with American Airlines again."
2847,"Typically American Airlines is my preferred airline, but now that I have had to work with their customer service department I question whether I will ever fly with them again. I was issued a voucher a year ago and it says redeemable at the ticket counter or by calling. As the expiration date approached I contacted them a few days before it expired to inquire about extending it. They said no. This was fine. I located a flight and booked it and then called again (September 2nd) to ""purchase"" the flight. At this point I was informed that I needed to begin my travel on that day or else lose the voucher. This travel requirement had not been previously communicated. Also, I was told they needed 2 weeks processing time so the voucher was no longer any good since I was not able to travel immediately. Had I known I needed to travel by a specific date I would have. If I knew that I needed two weeks to allow them to process the voucher (via mail) I would have gone to the airport directly. The vouchers do not come with these instructions. So I have used their poor website tools to communicate. First, I ""emailed"" customer service with no reply. Second, inadvertently I ""emailed"" ""customer relations"" (who knew they were different?). This second communication got things moving. I was told we have no record of the first email. So I| sent them the tracking number, to which the replied basically, ""oh yea, it's expired. Nothing we can do. Sorry. Keep flying with us though"". I have since resubmitted an ""email"" to them via their website. This is a horrible practice and outright poor communication on behalf of American Airlines."
2848,"American Airlines has definitely upped their game. I was upgraded due to my EP status on AA. Out of all the US airlines only AA regularly upgrades me. I spend a lot of money with them in my business, not sure if that is connected though. This is their A320 shuttle between LAX-JFK, replacing larger Boeing 767, which I used to fly. It cannot be compared. Seats are great, comfortable. The only illogical thing is USB / Headphone plugs and cell phones which is behind your seat, to make space in front. But it is a little annoyance. Food is great, better than on international AA flights I take from LAX-LHR. They had great starters, good wines and fresher food options. AVOD great, good sized personal TV.  AA is going the right direction, I just hope they don't become complacent again. The competition is tough and I recently tried Mint by JetBlue, which I dare to say was even better."
2849,"I'm extremely disappointed with American Airlines on my flight from Denver to Chicago. It is the first time I have flown with American Airlines. The flight attendants and staff are great, but the promise of wifi (that I ended up paying for and it doesn't work) is very deceiving. One of the reasons I picked this airline is for the WiFi and it doesn't work. And they have already charged my account."
2850,"My American Airlines flight was rescheduled 1hr 20 mins earlier than when I booked it. American Airlines did not notify me, so I missed the flight on Labor Day weekend that really messed things up for me. I wrote to the airline about this, and they replied with an email telling me that it is their policy that customers should check with the airline 24 hours before the flight in case there has been any changes. Other airlines notify customers of changes. On top of that, the rep at the counter was extremely unhelpful and booked me on a flight that I told him wasn't going to work. I had to go to a second rep to get it fixed. I saw the exact same thing happen to another guy. He got out of line after missing the same flight and called the airline to undo what the rep at the counter did without his permission."
2851,"The aircraft was okay considering it was economy but they should definitely allow more leg room. As if that wasn't enough, I was squished by 2 people who were well-rounded. Their legs came about 3-4 inches to my side of the seats. It doesn't sound like much but I was in a very tight space. I can't believe I chose them for my round trip, too. Some staff were nice, but many were rude.  In fact, there was a front desk agent who was on his phone the whole time while I needed to get my flight changed.  Every time I asked a question, he would answer like he was offended and I'm known to be one of the most polite people out there. He has basically inspired me to write this review. The only reason why they're not a flat out 0/10 is because there was one woman who found my wallet, came back all the way just as I was about to board my flight. If it wasn't for her generosity, I don't know what I would do. But I can definitely say she can move to a better airline considering her qualifications and the level of service she offered."
2852,"American Airlines Dublin - JFK - LAX - Honolulu - LAX flights on time. Fantastic crews, some of them had definitely been around a while (and I saw more than one wearing a pair of crocs) but they seemed to be genuine and take pride in their jobs. Great catering,  Dublin - JFK I had the best steak on a plane. Generous meals were served on the long domestic legs. Crew offer drink top ups. The seats Dublin - JFK were old angled seats, fine for daytime flight but I wouldn't like to travel overnight with these. The full flat seats between JFK and LAX on the new A321 were superb. The old recliner seats LAX-HNL-LAX flights were nothing to write home about but a step up from shorter haul business class in Europe. only thing that could have improved for me would be handheld IFE units given out to customers in First Class on LAX-HNL legs. The flights are around 5.5-6hrs and this would have vastly enhanced the experience."
2853,"La Paz to London via Miami. The main reason for this review is that American Airlines now check your baggage through. After booking the flights, I had a warning from a friend that you not only had to go landside when transiting, but you had to collect your bags to check in again. I had minimal time in (Dallas on the way out) Miami and AA reservations confirmed that baggage could not be checked through. They now do so and I made the LHR flight with about 30 minutes to spare (unhelpful immigration staff). The flights were uneventful and unimpressive, but cheap and got there in reasonable time. The only real gripe is the entertainment system. The Boeing 777 flights provide a woefully short number of films, documentaries, comedies, dramas and any choice would get a 'you want to watch it from 20 minutes in or wait for the next one in 10 minutes?' Sound and picture quality are very poor. The Boeing 757 flight from La Paz was a throwback to the 80's - fold down screens in the aisle, where you will watch the only showing, unless you're sitting in a window seat and you can't see the screen anyway. Point I did like was that, for a cheap cost, you can buy a better seat well in advance. As said, my flights to Peru and back from Bolivia were a lot cheaper than alternatives so if that means the TV options are rubbish, so be it."
2854,"Flew Dallas Fort Worth to Washington with American Airlines on an MD-80 with a new and modern interior. First Class seat seemed to be smaller than the old seats, a little tight in the rear. Flight departed and arrived on time. Cabin crew was super, after take off we were served a nice lunch, surprisingly the food was pretty good. Wi-Fi was available but I didn't make use of the service. Crew was funny, professional and extremely attentive, great service. American seems to be trying harder, great improvement."
2855,"A great American Airlines service. Flagship lounge very nice at JFK. Boarding on time, nice FA, new aircraft, very comfortable seating. Only thing, do not sit in the front row for business, it is very noisy and crew are close. Choose row 7 or 8. Nice food service, and snacks. "
2856,"American Airlines flight from Frankfurt to Miami on American Airlines. This flight is over 10 hours, and American Airlines thought it would suffice for such an expensive flight to have a plane with about 10 overhead cabin TVs (TVs that are obsolete and not made anymore), No personal TVs on each seat. No plug or usb for charging or wifi - so we can't even use our own personal device to watch or do something else besides watching the 1movie on the overheard TV screens on the plane because we can't charge our devices and will be dead in an hour on a 10 hour flight! I emailed American and they basically told me it was not ""profitable"" enough to have up to date planes for this flight - although it was pretty much sold out! Never again!"
2857,"We flew American Airlines from Los Angeles to Santo Domingo with a connection flight in Miami. All flights were delayed, on of them for fuel while all passengers were already on board. On the flight from Los Angeles to Miami we were on the plane after landing for 55 minutes - supposedly waiting for a gate, and almost missed the connecting flight."
2858,"Sao Paulo to New York JFK. American Airlines newer Boeing 777-300 have started looking tired and a bit dirty, like the old 777s and 767s. The service was very good and friendly. Both seat and entertainment worked well (same poor TV programming) and in spite of the fact that we had a pair of spoiled loud children on Business Class, the ride was smooth and comfortable. The food was quite average, but a very decent selection of wines. I a very pleased to see that decent service, at least in the premium cabin, is becoming more common. Not all flights for sure, but enough for frequent flyers to notice."
2859,"The 2nd leg of 2 to Las Vegas with American Airlines. After travelling from Manchester and now feeling rather tired and weary, we couldn't wait just to get on the plane and get away. When we seen the plane at the gate it was a lot smaller than our first flight so we expected to be squashed up like sardines for 6hrs as the flight was fully booked. Again the flight boarded on time and we were greeted  by the cabin crew, found our seats and to our surprise there was even more leg room than the first flight. The cabin was also fresh, clean and bright. Departure was delayed by an hour due to a technical fault with something to do with the fuel. Once up and away the inflight service commenced and free drinks were served which I wasn't expecting for an internal flight. The entertainment was in overhead TV's but I didn't expect seat back entertainment on a smaller plane. I didn't even expect TV's on the plane. We arrived in Vegas only 30 minutes late so that wasn't too bad after our 1 hour delay. No problems at all with this flight (apart from delay, but safety is paramount)."
2860,"Manchester to New York JFK with American Airlines, being the first leg of 2 travelling to Las Vegas with my wife and son. After reading some of the horror stories previously I wasn't looking forward to the flights. The day got off to a bad start with a 2hr queue for checking in at Manchester airport, and then to find out that the seats that my wife had booked online (window seats) were then not available to us and we were put in the centre section - although one of us would be sitting by ourselves, this was rectified on board with another passenger who kindly swapped. The flight was on time and we made it with 20 minutes to spare thanks to the mass chaos at check in, the plane looked new and clean from the outside, but once inside the aircraft all that changed, and you stepped back in time to the 1990's. The cabin was dreary and their was also a stale smell in the air (like a pub carpet), and also the entertainment system may have well been non existent with the overhead TV's (no seatback entertainment here). The flight was good, the cabin crew were good - friendly and no attitude, the food was good, and also the refreshment service was no problem (free drinks). The seats may have been old, but they were spacious and plenty of legroom in front. Would I fly with AA again - if I got the same level of service then yes, if it was a dirty aircraft that desperately needs dragging into the modern age for a long haul flight then no. American Airlines need to up their game in certain departments and make sure it happens across the board so everybody has the same level of service whether it be long or short haul."
2861,"I fly American many times throughout the year from DFW to US and international countries. The most annoying thing is when traveling via Miami, American loves to fill the aircraft with a ton of cargo so much so that flight will often be delayed departing, meaning a missed connection in Miami. Seems American loves to put people in Hotels in Miami from delayed flights. My recent flight from DFW via Miami catching American Eagle to GNV, I nearly missed with the connection because American in DFW decided to load a ton of cargo onto the Boeing 777-300ER. Granted the plane was flying onwards from Miami to RIO, but most of the passengers were making connections in Miami to other US cities via American Eagle. As the flight was delayed 1hr in DFW while a full plane sat on the ground, by the time the food for purchase came around the food had run out. So much so that the cabin crew started giving out free snack items. As to the delay from DFW, American was nice to give each person the full can of soda or Juice, and the pilots took us over the gulf to so we could reach Miami quicker.  Once landed in Miami everyone ran to D60 where all the American Eagle flights depart with a mad rush for the sky train to make the connections. "
2862,"Chicago to Minneapolis in American Airlines First class (due to upgrade) on an MD80 (an old plane, but seemed well maintained and comfortable for this short flight, with standard First class seats).  Flight on time and no drama. Cabin staff in First Class was attentive and trying to give a good experience. Coffee/Drinks and some pre-packaged cookies were distributed for breakfast. Check-in in ORD was slightly weird. I was using economy check-in kiosks, as they were closest to the door where I entered the airport and had no lines. The first two machines did not work and froze immediately. Going to the next machine I was approached by an American Airlines employee and asked if I needed help. “Probably not, if this machine works”. The third machine finally did work. However, I got a lecture by this officious person that American Airlines requires to be at the airport at least two hours before the flight and actually three hours is needed to make the flight. Aside from the fact that he did not know or ask my departure time or flight number or anything else before lecturing me and the whole area was not busy at all, he was just delaying me while doing the check-in. All officious, surly and completely unwarranted. I finished check-in, went through TSA within 15 minutes and still had more than one hour left to wait at the gate before boarding started. Priority bags out first in MSP. Except for this weird encounter during check-in, the flight was ok, but of course no way near a First Class experience. Also, of course good value due to the upgrade."
2863,"I was flying out of Maui and it took several American Airlines agents to figure out how to issue the boarding passes for my family and check our luggage from Maui to Ottawa. We waited from 7.15pm until 8.50pm for them. We were originally scheduled to fly with United as part of a code share with Air Canada. At the airport, when we checked in with UA, they informed us of the changes and sent us to AA counter as our trip from Maui to Los Angeles was now with American Airlines. The agents sent us back to UA. The agent at UA was very helpful, printed the itinerary for us and told us that all the information was in order. In the end, the AA manager made some phone call to figure out how to issue our boarding pass and check in our luggage. They could have done that within the first 20 minutes instead of wasting our 1.5 hours in that hot airport. We did not receive any apology. When they issued our boarding passes, our family of four were split into 3 groups, when there were 3 empty rows (9 seats) at the back of the plane. When I walked to the back of the plane and asked the stewardess about putting me and my husband back there, they said no. My guess was those seats were kept for them to sleep/use for storage during the flight. Crew service was average. It was a red eye flight so there was little service required. The crew did not greet the customers on arrival and departure. I will avoid AA in the future."
2864,American Airlines is not the airline it used to be and has gone downhill since the merger with US Airways. My wife and I were recently on a smaller plane from Hartford to National and my wife could not make the flight. When I called to see if they would change the flight for her I was told it would cost an additional $200 plus the difference in the cost of the ticket. I expected this and had a fall back of a $60 fare with another airline. Told myself I would enjoy the extra room on the cramped seats with the seat next to me being empty. American Airlines decided to put someone in the seat and after I told them I had paid for it and wanted to use it was told too bad they could take it. So this seat was paid for twice. Once by me and again by another passenger.
2865,"Guadalajara to Chicago via Dallas/Ft Worth with American Airlines, and no problems. Flight to Guadalajara and back were good. Seat was not comfortable on the older MD80, but well managed and very clean. The A320 has inflight entertainment, however it stopped working about 30 minutes before landing. Flight attendants were kind and attentive, and the snack pack is actually a good buy on economy. Overall, very enjoyable experience."
2866,"American airlines has gone downhill since the merger, the personnel are rude and unhelpful especially in Phoenix. My most current flight was so cramped. They cut corners and up prices. This flight over the Pacific felt like I was on a flight from the early 90s it was so behind the times in the cabin."
2867,"I am so disappointed in American Airlines and their customer service. On August 26th I left from Vancouver to head to LAX. I was supposed to have a 51 minute layover before I jumped on my next flight to Denver. This was not going to be a problem, I was assured by many staff members that our arrival gate was right next to my departure gate, I did not have any luggage only a carry on, and did not need to go through security, just simply get on the flight. As I boarded my plane, we were told that we would have to sit there for another 45 minutes because LAX was under construction and was not ready for us to arrive at our estimated time. This made my connection now only 25 minutes before departure of my Denver flight, but again I was reassured by staff that this would not be an issue. Upon arrival at 9pm (25 minutes before departure of next flight) the pilot informed us that even though they were aware there were many who needed to run to their connecting flight, we were unable to get off. By the time we got off the plane and ran next door to our gate, American Airlines flight to Denver had already closed the door. I ran to the staff member right away as I was only a minute or two behind the designated ""door closing"" time and was rudely dismissed and told there was nothing that could be done. After waiting 20 minutes, a member came and helped me reschedule my flight for the next morning at 6.30am. Seeing as it was 9.30 pm, I would need accommodation for the night. American Airlines offered zero help with accommodation. In result, seeing as my flight was very early in the morning and I needed to be there the night before, I had to stay at a hotel close by. I contacted AA about this issue, but my complaint and request for reimbursement was dismissed. I will never fly AA again."
2868,"After boarding the American Airlines flight, we were kept on the plane, sitting on the tarmac for 2 hours. There were vague updates every 45 minutes and the flight attendants knew nothing about what the hold-up was. We were told that something minor had to be fixed and then were told that paperwork was being wrapped up but we had to wait another 45-60 minutes for this. Whenever the flight crew made an announcement, it didn't sound like they really knew what was going on. To top off the fact that they kept us trapped on the plane for that long, the flight attendant only came around one time to give us one small glass of water. Then 1.5 hrs after we took off, they offered us another glass of a complimentary beverage (after we took off the plane felt very stable in the air but apparently the pilot ordered that beverage service not start for a long period of time - no reason was provided). Overall, the way American Airlines crew handled this situation was very disappointing. They came off as incompetent. That entire experience was awful."
2869,"I'm one of the passengers of AAL 95 flight that had to leave today August 29th at 10:55 AM heading from Madrid to New York. We had a technical problem half an hour after starting the journey and we have been informed that we returned to Barajas airport to repair it. Once there, just over half an hour later they informed us that the problem was solved but they had to consult with Dallas if the flight crew could conduct in question or not. Minutes later, they told us that regrettably could not make the trip and moved all the passengers to a hotel with expenses paid. Moreover, we confirmed that the flight would leave the next day at 9:00 AM and we had to be at the airport at 6:00 am in order to embark. What is our surprise now, in the hotel where we are staying, they have been placed for a notice explaining that the flight will start tomorrow at 9:00 PM by decision of the pilot. After calling the airline does not give us any reason to delay the flight 12 hours. We have wasted two whole days."
2870,"London to New York with American Airlines. The cabin crew were friendly, food was tasty, and the trip was comfortable. For a relatively long flight, it was pleasant, and more comfortable than many flights I've been on."
2871,"Paris CDG to New York JFK I only flew American Airlines because all of the one-stop flights from Cairo to New York via Qatar Airways were full, and I figured that one transatlantic flight on American Airlines was worth it to experience Qatar Airways business class between Doha and CDG. Boarding was slightly problematic. They announced business class boarding, and when I walked up to go through, I was rudely told that only business class passengers were boarding. It was assumed that due to my appearance that I couldn't possibly be a business class passenger, but once they realized the mistake, no apology was forthcoming. The plane was obviously old and the IFE personal entertainment screen was small, with a very limited selection of movies and television shows. When ""The Good Wife"" is the most interesting series available, there's a problem. However, the seat worked, and the flight attendants were nice, even though they didn't go the extra mile- everyone had to take care of their own carry-on and put it in the overhead bin. My special Halal meal was great, for both the main course and snack selectio"". My main course was similar to everyone else's in terms of presentation, but my snack was even better - instead of the Croque Monsieur Sandwich or Thai sandwich that the other passengers got, I got an awesome shrimp dish. The flight wasn't bad, per se, but if you're going to fly business class, there are many better airlines out there."
2872,"London Heathrow to New Orleans via JFK, LGA, CLT, DFW, on Boeing 777-300ER, A321/319 and Canadair RJ900. I had a code share flight from Geneva with British Airways but I had to change terminal which meant clearing security again - American Airlines has very few European connections at Heathrow so I'd rather transit elsewhere, given the choice. While free wine and beer is a welcome addition in economy class, the food is still lacking in quality and served in little black boxes that give an industrial feel. Integration with US Airways is incomplete; I had a domestic flight segment operated with a US Airways flight number but an aircraft with American Airlines livery on the outside (and US Airways inside) and there was no way to know whether I'd have to pay for my luggage. It ended up costing me $25 from LGA to MSY - no prior warning (and another website that declared the charge would have been cheaper overall). Change of airport required for a connection in New York so I spent a few days there. Generally the cabin crew were pretty friendly and I appreciated the interiors in the new Boeing 777-300ER with individual IFE. On the way home, they would have wanted me to pay $25 to choose any other seat on my flight from MSY to DFW but the back row; $75 to choose anything but a middle seat between DFW and LHR. I thought this was stingy, especially since I checked in early. Also, when I tried to check in online, the AA website sent me to US Airways and then US Airways sent me back to AA. With my BA legs I had 3 different booking codes (I had to find the US Airways one from Check My Trip). Flight out of LGA was late - the captain never came on to explain why it took so long to taxi to the runway - but the crew were great, eg. making people change seats just before landing so that anyone with a tight connection got an aisle seat. Overall I felt that this experience was not bad; better than United but I would always choose a European Airline over American Airlines if I could. A lot of disabled people were helped by the ground crew which was good. While the apps were pretty bad in the sense that check in was hard and so was getting my own boarding pass - it's not possible to download it to the app. I did. however, appreciate the Wifi luggage checking facility - you can scan your baggage tag and see if your bags made it to the plane through the onboard wifi."
2873,"Customer service non-existent. D and E gates at Charlotte Douglas Airport are a zoo. Planes are old and interiors dirty and in some cases broken seats or tears in the storage pockets - they look tattered and beat. With some exception the flight attendants act like they are doing you a favor with a surly attitude. I will give them the rest of the year to show some improvement and if no, I will switch to one of their competitors."
2874,"I recently flew with my husband and 10 year old daughter and was absolutely appalled with every part of American Airlines, from the staff to the aircraft itself. The customer service was just non existent, the staff were rude and abrupt. The cabin crew were scruffy and had appalling manners. As for the plane itself well where do I start, a 7 hour flight to New York, no TVs , no radio, no inflight entertainment whatsoever. We were given an extremely thin blanket a pillow so small a 2 year old would have struggled to use it. The food was horrendous. When I complained I was told I should have brought my own if I didn't like it. We were offered 2 drinks throughout the whole flight. "
2875,"My experience travelling from Quito in Ecuador (UIO) to EWR via MIA with American was truly a very poor experience. Firstly I had a problem with my initial flight to UIO on a different airline but same alliance (One World) on an unlinked itinerary - zero assistance from American - I would be still be in Ecuador only for the help from LAN Ecuador. Rude, unhelpful and petty rule driven check in employees at AA in Quito Airport causing long lines at check in. Old B767 - my standard overhead carry on bag would not fit in the bins. In Flight Entertainment was limited to an old overhead screen about 20"" Poor food offering - meal service took over an hour to be cleared and there was no further beverage service through the flight. Had to ask for Blanket and Pillow. Cabin Crew who went through the motions but were not engaged with passengers. Glad to get off the AA plane and hope that I never have to fly American Airlines again."
2876,"I really enjoyed this airline. It was I'd say the cabin crew was 95.9% polite and I enjoyed the food. Since I was in economy, you'd normally think the legroom would have no leg-room. I thought there was plenty of space since I am of an average height. The toilets were great and the 9 hour flight was worth it. I would say they could've come round a bit more often, but other than that everything was great. I will be definitely taking this airline again."
2877,"Scheduled flight to leave on Sunday August 16, 2015 from Sea/Tac at 1:31pm. The plane that we were going to use pulled up to pick us up.  Then some ""newly hired flight attendant"" activates the slide - see the photo. Evidently once the slide has been deployed out the side of the plane, you can't just poke it back in and fly away. Also, who would have guessed that there isn't a backup plane available. So now we have to wait until 8pm for another plane to fly from Dallas to pick us up. Does it take 6 hours to fly from Dallas to Seattle? I think not. We are notified that we will miss all our connecting flights. The next seats available to Des Moines aren't until Tuesday or Wednesday. Well that isn't going too well with our employers, so we negotiate through a supervisor with ""finance"" to get reimbursement should we fly to another city and take ground transport home. BTW, we were offered snacks for sale and a movie headphone for sale while we were on our flight with 200 passengers that also sat at the airport all day waiting for this flight. Absolutely rude. Okay so we were up all night flying and arrived in nearby city at 9:30am on Monday so we could drive home 2 more hours. We were sleep deprived but finally home around noon on Monday. Sent email asking for refund for airline tickets and ground transport. We are being offered a voucher for airline tickets with American and nothing for ground transport. They say because we took a flight to another destination that they don't pay for ground transport. "
2878,"The new American Airlines business class on the Boeing 777 is very good with two exceptions. First, catering needs a serious upgrade. The food was barely edible, and I must admit although I like ice cream for dessert, my expectations are a bit higher when travelling business class on a long-haul flight. The so called ""Champagne"" is Prosecco, which is a fine Italian product, but not Champagne by a long shot. I would suggest that American Airlines should either offer the real thing, or call it Prosecco. My second exception has to do with the comfort of the seat. It is great for sleeping, but for day-time travel it is not very comfortable. "
2879,"This is an impressive and smooth aircraft and I had waited months to my first AA787 experience. For that reason I flew from NY to Buenos Aires via DFW. I've flown other 787s and this aircraft's first impression is created by the incredible effect of its smart lighting and design. Boarding AA's 787 from DFW to EZE was nothing like it. The cabin was quite dark and it felt very cold and claustrophobic. Overall the crew showed a lack of knowledge of the product and did not know how to help passengers enjoy the excellent experience flying a 787 is in itself. AA's 787 has, in my opinion, very decent and comfortable seats (I slept over 7 hours) and great personal space. But entertainment did not work for a portion of the flight and crew members did not seem to know how to fix it. Service was very slow and very impersonal and it seemed as if it was short of 1 or even 2 crew members. There was nothing memorable about the food, but who flies AA for its culinary virtues? So it was ok. Although I did not pre-order my breakfast before falling sleep, I was fully awake when that service started, yet they skipped me, and I was informed that because I did not tell them a few hours prior that I wanted to eat in the morning, they might not have much left for me (at the end I was served the full meal). I loved being on this aircraft and will look forward to my next flight in it. Too bad AA is missing the opportunity of incorporating decent service to an amazing aircraft in order to deliver the wow factor of other carriers' 787 operation. Beautiful brand new plane and very smooth ride with the poor service of and old 767-200."
2880,"This summer my family and I took a vacation to see Europe. We chose an overnight flight so that our children could sleep and the first row so that we could have more room and be comfortable. Needless to say my girls fell asleep and my two year old laid down under our feet on the floor and fell asleep. The seat belt sign was on pretty much the whole flight with no turbulence. My two year old, as mentioned before, was completely out of the way so passing people and airline staff had a clear path way but I was continually harassed instead of helped by staff telling me that policy states she can not be on the floor with the seat belt sign on. Thus, I had to wake up a peacefully sleeping child who then cried and disturbed others. If I could have come up with a better solution I would have but the hand rests on these new planes do not move up in the front row due to there being TV's in them and the seats only go back so far. On the flight back the movie was acting up and instead of going to check to see if it could be fixed they just said that nothing could be done about the bad quality of the movie. This is not the first time I have had such an experience with American Airlines. Their customer service is terrible and they should be ashamed of treating customers that way and have a little more compassion for traveling parents with children."
2881,This knocks spots off British Airways (same alliance). The business suites are much more private than Club World. The crew were friendly and the cabin was the right temperature. I was very impressed. There was virtually nothing I disliked about this flight and I will fly with them again.
2882,"Very decent flight with excellent, personalized service. For an avid critic of AA most of my life, it is time to say that I truly believe this airline is changing for the good. There is still garbage on my seat pocket, lunch was almost not edible and WiFi remains far from great, but the human component of the service is genuíne and professional."
2883,"Flew from SJO-DFW-AMS and got bit afraid to fly American due to all those bad reviews but didn't had any of all those. For starters their new triple 7 is a nice plane, even I flew in economy. For starters plenty of leg room, even for economy for a long haul flight. Entertainment system was ok, didn't had many movies that were my style but then again the fact that you could swipe over the screen to change between movies, games etc, was great. Food was poor, especialy the breakfast on the flight from SJO to DFW. Also switching between airplanes in DFW was awful but nothing American could do about. For the price I paid I got what I got expected nothing more, nothing less. "
2884,Business class? Are you kidding. Seats were wider than economy but that's it. No more reclinable or comfortable than coach. The only half decent perk was the food because it was warm vs. the humiliating sandwich offered in coach. The movies were free in business but I can't believe that they charge for movies in coach on an international 6 hour flight.
2885,"Admiral Club Lounge in JFK terminal 8 was decent, truly nothing special with limited drinks and food served without additional charge. Business class seats onboard the 777 were comfortable and one could easily spend even a bit longer flight browsing the sufficient entertainment selection on the flat screen tv. Food was ok, dinner nothing special but breakfast with lots of fresh fruit and berries great. Cabin crew were mostly very bored, even rude. Hardly any smiles to be seen and no real passion to make ones flight a real experience. Won't spend my money on American again, if I can choose something else instead."
2886,"Poor overall compared with other flights, particularly the BA one we got from Manchester to Heathrow then to Washington on the way out to the US. The flight was delayed overall by at least an hour, we spent the majority of the delay time sat waiting to set off due to a ""Minor repair"" which was announced by the pilot over the tannoy once we were on board quite some time later. Our delay continued probably due to missing our take off slot, it wasn't clear because no-one really explained what was happening. Within this time period, the cabin crew turned up and suggested we should move to another seat, we'd been settled into our seats for 20-25 minutes and had chosen seats towards the rear of the plane close to the toilets. When we tried to reserve a seat together before flying, it was fairly limited at the time and we were happy enough to be here however the lady suggested they'd be making a lot of noise behind us and would probably be bashing about around the seats as it appeared they'd used up the back row for their stuff and seating, we said this was OK initially but she continued to prompt us to move, we started to do so with us having to start moving and packing up our stuff, there wasn't much in the way of help on offer and we were made to feel like we were causing more of an inconvenience by booking ahead to get our seats, no suggestion of where were going was made initially which resulted in us moving without our stuff and in the end all the confusion and messing about just raised our stress levels. It appeared in the end that some of the cabin crew had taken up the seats around us and thankfully some of the crew, particularly one of the younger female crew members and another gentleman were very courteous and offered help with a clearly very upset passenger, the other more senior staff could do to perhaps follow their lead as their idea of customer service was far below expected. Aside from this, this particular plane had screens above rather than individual ones on the back of the seats, one film was offered, food was OK, same usual fare, I assume from the amount of chatter about drinks I heard that there was a shortage of certain drinks, particularly beer at one point. Generally, I'm disappointed as this is one of the longest and one of the most expensive flights I've been on. I've flown on the more notoriously bad budget airlines and still found that despite all the shortcomings at least the staff seem to care and they also seem to be a bit more apologetic about late flights, I don't think I'd use American Airlines again if there was another choice."
2887,"In all surprise by the low level of the service provided. Flight on time, and check in and on ground service ok. Once on board, FA desinterested. No a single smile. Robotic service provided. Food ok, but not great, Wine service basic. Welcome drink on a plastic cup. Seat on the 767 comfortable, lie-flat. Terminal 8 in NY easy to walk and fast passport and customs clearance."
2888,"Unbelievably poor service, communication, and accommodation provided by the AA staff in Chicago. After delayed flight from Traverse City, MI, my flight from Chicago to San Diego was also delayed. Very little communication at the gate by staff, as we watched the monitor change the departure time over and over again. First a delay of two hours, then half an hour, then two minutes here, 10 minutes there and before you know it, the flight was delayed until 11 pm. This was extremely frustrating to be strung along for so long. At the very last second, the gate crew made an unintelligible announcement that our flight was being rerouted to LAX. This created chaos and provided only minutes for people to try and make arrangements at their final destinations before boarding and take off. Announcements were difficult to hear and brusquely delivered. On the plane, the crew was perfunctory and unhelpful. The reason for the rerouting was that the San Diego airport would be closed at midnight and we would not make it in time. I am sure the airline staff knew this and could have provided that information in a much more timely fashion than it did. Very disappointing to be treated with such disrespect, disregard and callousness. A bus was provided for the final leg to San Diego, making the trip a grueling all night, uncomfortable affair. My last flight with AA."
2889,"I took 4 flights with them, 3 of them were late by a minimum of 2 hours. My eticket mentioned the wrong time for the flight from Sao Paolo to Miami and if I had not checked the day before I would have missed it. In Miami there were over 300 passengers waiting to board when we were told that they did not have a plane. When I expressed surprise at this fact I was told that I could walk if I was not happy with the situation. The staff in general were not helpful apart from a wonderful woman in Sao Paolo who sorted out my luggage effectively. The other passengers had sorry tales of missed connections and rudeness from staff. The only positive thing I can say is that my luggage was not lost. Altogether an experience I do not want to repeat."
2890,"A truly dreadful aircraft, older than most of the people on board. Took this flight for convenience to Manchester and expected a decent business class standard. Everything was below standard, the seat, the inflight entertainment (there are no personal screens on this aircraft), in business we are given a tablet. American Airlines obviously do not value Manchester based passengers as this aircraft should have been replaced or updated years ago. Even one of the crew said they had requested to be taken off the route as there are so many technical issues with this aircraft. For info I am writing this awaiting the return flight which has just been delayed by an hour due to local weather in Chicago whilst most other flights are leaving on time, again American don't value Manchester customers, and they should be ashamed of all of the above."
2891,"Minimal room between seats. I could not open or use my laptop as the person in front of me reclined their seat, but I could easily rest me head on the back of their seat, it was that close. Served a single beverage. Arrived on-time and tried to get on a flight that left for Syracuse 4 hours eariler. Since I am not a premier American flyer in this airlines computers I was not allowed to board even though there were several empty seats according to the agent. Called customer service and was told the same thing. American Airlines cost me four hours of my day just because I was not a premier flyer?"
2892,"I am once again reminded how horrible American Airlines has become. I flew this route many years in the 70s and 80s when American Airlines knew how to treat their customers. Now you can expect delays, pray that you get your luggage and brace yourself for rude agents and almost no assistance with any problems related to delays or connections. As I head back on the last leg of this trip, I vow to never fly American Airlines again. I will take a direct flight on Jet Blue to Newark and make the drive to Syracuse. Other airlines have learned customer service. American Airlines has not."
2893,"I have had plenty reasons to complain in the past about traumatic AA flights, but my LAX-JFK flight was impeccable. Best service and attitude by crew in years on this route and fantastic seat, state-of-the art entertainment (good movies, not that great tv programs). Also a nice clean cabin, that made me forget the dirty experience of the 767s."
2894,"If I could sum my AA experience in one word that it is disappointing. The Boeing 757 was really old. You could tell the aircraft was at least 20 years old by looking at the seats. American Airlines is promising a lot of new aircraft and improved hard product (one new aircraft every week) but I've done a lot of travelling over the past month (Miami-St. Maarten, St. Maarten-Miami, Miami-Los Angeles, Las Vegas-Miami) and only got to fly on a new Airbus A319 once. That was also disappointing because you had to pay both for the entertainment and the food. The inflight WiFi worked and offered three options: GoGo InFlight: Pay to browse the internet, check e-mails, etc. Prices like $4 for half an hour. Not bad. American Airlines Entertainment you can rent a movie for $5-$7. Ridiculous. Two free movies were available but none of them would play. "
2895,"I knew not to expect too much from AA, but wanted to make my own judgement. I can just confirm the opinion of the majority of the other reviewers. Old plane, pretty cold cabin crew, basically no inflight entertainment, meal not worth it, coffee and wine just awful. The only plus points - good connecting time to my final destination (ORD) and we were on time."
2896,"Unlike the international flight I took from Europe with AA, this domestic flight was quite okay particularly because of very open cabin crew attitude. Everything else was just okay. Nothing extraordinary, but nothing that I should complain about."
2897,"To start off they were overbooked, and I was not even sure I had a ticket until last minute. The seats are rock hard, and I ended up standing half of the flight.  I was supposed to be on a Korean Air flight, and that is how it was labeled, but there was nothing Korean Air about this long and horrible flight. I had fourteen hours in a seat that was so uncomfortable. The entertainment was rubbish, and there was little choice in movies. You could not pause a movie once you started it, you could only stop it and start it all over again. The remote on my seat would not go back into the holder and I had to force it back in. There were not enough bathrooms and always a line. I would never consider this airline if I was flying over three hours again."
2898,"On hold for 20-30 min about my missing checked luggage at this writing. My miserable experience began with their two competing online sites - one to make reservation thereafter just to be told to use other site to select seats, asking me for a ""locator"" code which wasn't given in the first instance. After much struggles and hassles connecting by phone with life agent adding a child to my travelling party, and entering payment info, screen got stuck at ""please wait a moment while processing etc"" through the night. Next morning I finally woke up to the idea of installing their Android app on my smart phone. When at long last I managed to reach the seating plan, the two last remaining economy seats I selected were no more and I was left with having to pay extra for the extra legroom seats. Upon boarding I was appalled by the aged aircraft and obsolete amenities. No individual screens, no plug-ins for phones, not even basic earphones provided unless you pay $5. Both featured movies were 2nd rate and displayed on some heavy CRT suspended units which emitted a very annoying glare during the red-eye flight. The extra legroom was not worthwhile or all that noticeable, as an equally crucial attribute was the lateral tightness of the seats which caused the usual shoulder-rubbing and sleeplessness. It was all-in-all was a strange throw-back to the 70s. For a flight of such duration, there was only one serving of drinks but even then, no snack of any sort. There were no pillows, but some left-over garbage from an earlier flight in the seat pocket. I arrived at baggage claim before others and there was a very long interlude for belt to start moving. Eventually after a prolonged and futile watch, my checked luggage was never forthcoming so I headed to their baggage service to report missing luggage. Luckily agent was helpful and wait wasn't long to write up the delayed baggage claim. However I was perturbed by the sheer number of displaced/delayed baggage affecting over hundred other passengers. An agent finally picked up my call after 35 minutes wait. Their online baggage status still has no update on my luggage where-about. Agent could not give any reason why, despite luggage was being checked over an hour and a half prior to flight departure."
2899,"Service was shocking. The flight from MIA-CUN was delayed due to a thunderstorm which grounded all aircrafts and closed the airport. American Airlines had informed passengers and since there was nothing which could be done, we waited in lounge for boarding to begin. Upon boarding aircraft, the FA's offered drinks and that's where the hospitality ended. After takeoff they came around once more with drinks, and packaged snacks. Afterwards, they stood in the gallery gossiping rather loudly and complaining about the airline (found it rather off putting). On the return leg, similar service. Loud FA's, packaged snacks and less than mediocre service. Older planes on both legs, but they were clean and seats were comfortable. Check-in in CUN was quick and efficient."
2900,"Arrived at the airport 2.5 hours ahead of my scheduled departure. When I arrived at the ticket counter to check my bag, I was advised my flight had been cancelled at some point late last night or early in the morning due to a flight crew issue. I was placed on a flight that was four hours later than my original flight. All other flights were full so I had to enjoy my six hour visit at the airport. My complaint is for this reason only, other airlines I fly give you email updates when a flight is delayed or cancelled. If American Airlines had taken this approach I could have possibly made another reservation or at least, hung out in my hotel for another four hours. Instead I had to hang out in an airport for six hours."
2901,"Excellent product. A first class experience. Check in, lounge,inflight service, entertainment and food all top class. Highly recommended. The seat comfort and personnel space is the aircrafts best feature. Their business class also has a very smart comfy feel."
2902,"Flew to Hong Kong via Dallas and back. I had a nice conversation with a flight attendant in the rear of the plane while I couldn't sleep. People don't realize that there are more than one flight attendant available to serve drinks and some snacks during flight, not just during their meal times. American's level of service is very standard for major carriers like Delta and United both domestically and internationally. I find that the majority of the time when I'm traveling it is passengers who do not understand air travel that are most frequently angry or upset. Those of us who travel frequently understand, those that don't have no idea. "
2903,"Onboard we were told the aircraft had mechanical problem ant we have to disembark and go to another similar plane on another gate. Everybody boarded to this alternative plane with no air conditioning in the hot August in Texas evening. The destination airport was also changed. After waiting more than 1.5 hrs in the plane we told by the crew that plane is going nowhere, and we will be given hotel vouchers until the flight next morning. Everybody got off the plane. The hotel given to us had no shuttle running. We were told that ever 15 minutes shuttle pass by the hotel. We had to hire a private van to get to the hotel. It was already 12 midnight with my four children and wife with one of the most miserable trips of my life.  Our next flight was at 7:30am but no hotel shuttle until 6 AM. We had to pay again to hire a cab to the airport. Will never ever travel again with American Airlines."
2904,"American Airlines delayed my flight for 3 hours because they didn't have the ""proper crew with experience to fly from San Jose to Dallas"". I finally get to Dallas and they have canceled my flight to Houston for weather reasons. Other airlines would have delayed the flight as the weather passes. The 3 times I've had to fly them it's been the same experience."
2905,"The flight back from Tokyo was awful. My in-flight entertainment was broken, they tried resetting it 3 times but it never worked. No music, movies, TV, games, nothing. Just a green screen the whole flight. The food was disgusting. Drinks and snacks were offered sparsely. I emailed American in regards to my in-flight entertainment being inoperable and received a basic ""sorry, your experience doesn't qualify for any sort of compensation."" The American Way magazine advertised our 777-200 with WiFi however WiFi was not available to us. Overall the worst experience I've had aboard an airplane."
2906,"I take this flight a few times a year and it is a good experience, however on my last flight the attendant went out of her way finding me a special meal and going over and above with her service. She changed my bad mood into a great mood and I wanted to thank her! "
2907,"I actually flew American four different times in one week, and experienced significant delays each trip, resulting in my not reaching my destination until 3 to 4 hours after the time I was originally supposed to arrive. The airline was completely unapologetic about the delays, which caused problems with rental cars and also made the entire travel experience exhausting. I will not fly this airline again. In addition, the airline charges for everything - wifi, baggage, snacks, even additional foot space."
2908,"A dirty and smelly plane, horrible food, dreadful coffee, and bad American Airlines service. Separated from my partner because the flight was overbooked - buying your tickets 8 months beforehand is apparently not enough. First time and last time ever with American Airlines, I have had a better experience in a low cost Russian Tupolev."
2909,"Missed my flight. Been on standby all day. They were letting several American Airlines staff on every standby flight, totally disregarding the customers.  Don't ever miss your flight with American Airlines. You will not be compensated or put on first availability standby. You will be at the airport for hours or maybe even days. Zero customer service. They are better about customer service on the phone versus in person at the airport. American Airlines tried to make me check my bag which clearly fits the carry on size and I threw a fit. They didn't make me pay for my bag only because my departure time was coming up."
2910,"Prior to take off the air hostesses wandered the aisles for what looked to be a general safety check. Not the case it would appear. Passenger next to me had their seatbelt undone, tray table down balancing an open drink? The row in front had their armrests up with seats reclined. Across the aisle passengers had their sun shade down while using their cell phone. This was just within 3 rows."
2911,"This was our first time in first class and the experience was horrific! We flew to Montego Bay from Killeen Tx and when we arrived, our luggage did not. It would've been ok if they were courteous and respectful but they were horrible. We arrived at Montego Bay at 3.55pm and didn't get to speak with anyone about our luggage until 6.15 pm because the person who was suppose to be at our counter (AA) was ""busy assisting someone else"" as they kept telling us. When we did speak with someone, they informed me that our luggage was still in Dallas but will arrive first thing in the morning. We were excited to hear that and continued on to our resort. First thing in the morning came and went, afternoon came and went, evening came and went. We had the hotel call the airport (we tried calling ourselves but the room phone wouldn't properly dial out the 800 number) they were told the luggage would be here soon. Our luggage came at 11 pm the second night we were there. Our vacation was only for 6 days, two days have already passed when we received it. No one knows why we didn't get it until and when the resort called they kept lying (AA representative) and said it was already on its way and would be here in two hours. We heard two hours for two days. Fast forward 8 days. We used AA once again for our trip to Aruba which was 8 days after this first disaster. When we go to check in (again first class/business class) the airline double booked us and had us flying to multiple locations. AA rep informed us we would have to check in at counter. We went to check in at the counter and it took us TWO hours, yes two hours to fix our reservations. I am traveling with my SO who is a disabled veteran (we both are veterans) who was told he had to stand those two hours because they didn't have a wheelchair available for him. It takes AA two hours to issue us tickets and then they change our flights making our stay in Aruba airport 4 hours. When I expressed how disappointed we were the AA rep informed me that this is the norm for AA. He said we shouldn't be complaining about only waiting two hours to get our tickets printed. He was rude along with the manager who kept talking in Spanish. We fly often, very often using American Airlines and we are embarrassed for you guys treating customers this way. "
2912,"My 3.5 hour flight was scheduled to depart at 5am going to Dallas. Ground crew announced the flight was overbooked. Many passengers were on standby which caused some problems. Boarding was chaotic and unorganized but fortunately managed to close the doors on time. The aircraft was their new A321. Cabin was clean, seats are ok with IFE and legroom is spacious. Take off was smooth. To my horror we had to pay in order for us to watch a movie and even use the wifi. For the whole flight nobody served drinks to passengers. A lot of the passengers were complaining. Flight attendants were at the back chatting. "
2913,"US Airways now merged into American Airlines does not seem to have made much effort into improving service! Despite a good aircraft and a well extended network, with an IFE not functioning on my seat and a crew with a ""it's just a job"" attitude, the experience was unpleasant!"
2914,"We were delayed 2.5 hours in the airport. Then when we do board we sit in the airplane for another hour with no updates as to what was going on. Finally the captain tells us the flight crew ""timed out"" and we have to return to the terminal. We waited another 20 minutes to get in to the terminal and were told to go to the help desk to reschedule. We returned to the line containing about 4 separate flights worth of people. They would only put us on AA flights so we were very limited. We received no compensation or food vouchers and were forced to sleep at the airport. The next day we caught our flights and though we were told our baggage would be in Philadelphia to meet us, it was not. We had to wait in another long line to give our information to have it delivered. "
2915,Every single one of my flights was either delayed or canceled. It took me over 10 hours past my flight time just to get out of Boston. I was promised another connecting flight since American made me miss my original flight because they didn't have a document giving them flight clearance (it took them over 2 hours just to get a piece of paper that said we could take off faxed over). I get in to Chicago and I'm told that I can't get on the connecting flight (over booked of course). They put me on a plane that leaves 14 hours later. I am refused a hotel voucher even though it was Americans's fault I missed my flight. I had to sleep in a cold airport terminal by myself and wasn't even offered a food voucher or given an apology. 
2916,Our flight from MAN to JFK was cancelled due to engine issues which resulted in us having to rebook and we ended up flying via LHR. Our rebooked flight was with British Airways which was much better as they offered individual inflight entertainment systems unlike American who are still on an old system of overhead TVs. Our flight back from JFK was delayed and when we eventually got on board the aeroplane was quite possibly the oldest plane I have been on with a cabin crew to match. After 10 minutes the pilot informed us that a member of American Airlines staff had attempted to open the cabin door when it had already been locked which resulted in the life raft falling off the plane! We had to all disembark and after an hours wait we were told our flight was cancelled and we would need to rebook. We were put on flight the next day via Dublin which resulted us being over 24 hours late home. Appalling service and we will never travel with them again.
2917,"We flew from Boston, MA to St. Thomas U.S.V.I. on July 14th 2015. Flight #1619 from Boston to Miami was our first leg of the trip and that went smoothly. Then we got onto flight #2421 from Miami to St. Thomas. It was delayed a half hour. We landed in St. Thomas still being able to make our ferry to Tortola. However, it took 1 hour and 45 minutes for all of our luggage to be deplaned. During this time three other planes landed, all of their luggage was sorted out and the passengers from those planes left the terminal. We found one of our pieces of luggage was still in Miami. Our flight came in at 3.30pm, originally supposed to land at 2.57pm. It is well know that ferries stop running from Charlotte Amalie at 4.30pm. American should have done everything in its power to get people on their way. At least one third of the passengers were in the same situation as us. Four others lost baggage. My son spent the next morning trying to reconnect with his luggage and were told we would have to make a trip to the ferry terminal to pick it up. Now on to our flight home, July 25th 2015, we arrive at the airport three hours before our flight. The six of us were flying from St. Thomas to Philadelphia, PA on flight 837 leaving at 3.05pm. We arrived at the airport at 11.45am. We went to the kiosk and got our plane tickets and then joined the extremely long line (1.5 hours), at the ticket counter, just to get our luggage tags."
2918,"Long detour to get from GRU to LAX but gave me the chance to experience their J flagship product both in the international (B777-300) and domestic (A321) products. The individual reverse herringbone seats on the 777 are second to none. Privacy and sleeping space are guaranteed. The entertainment is good enough and the flight crew professional and even friendly to some extent. The one downside was the food, which was not only below what one would expect for J and not very tasty either. In the transcon similar experience. The full lie flat in J is a nice touch, and even getting over the other passenger is not a problem at all. The only major difference was the crew, who were a bit more standoffish."
2919,"Be well warned that if you cross the Atlantic with American Airlines, they are likely to put you on a small 3x3 plane with absolutely no entertainment system. I was charged $85 for a few pounds luggage overweight where practically any other airline crossing the Atlantic would have let me pass through with it."
2920,"Business class was excellent, plenty of food choices, generous servings and good food quality. Avoid the bulkhead seats in Business Class or the seats in the last row of Business Class. The variety of inflight movies is excellent as is the sound quality."
2921,"The old Boeing 777 had been retrofitted. They removed First Class and Business Class seats upgraded to fully flat seats over two sections of the aircraft with a nice bar in between. Cabin crew were nicer and even managed to smile (have not seen that in a long time). The food offered was better also:  ie. for breakfast, a plate of fresh fruit with some granola and greek yogurt, warm scone, jam and butter. "
2922,"My flight was scheduled to leave at 7.45 to Newark after it was delayed twice, we finally boarded close to 9pm. The staff did not give a reason as to why the flight was delayed and then told me that all other flights to Newark were booked up. "
2923,"Because of a delay caused by weather we missed a connecting flight. However thats' not the issue. We arrived at Chicago late and missed a connection to Greenbay. We were put on a standby flight to be told that it was unlikely that we would get on. This was a Sunday evening. When we pressed for information about the next flight, we were told that this might be 8.30pm on Tuesday, as if this were not a problem. Pardon, not a problem! A family of three in the middle of Chicago, stranded for 3 days. There was no help at all. No useful information as to where we might go, what we could do, what transport we might be able to get. We were stranded and they did not give any assistance at all. It was a crisis for us. "
2924,"This review is about their ridiculous process to get credited for miles on their and their partners flights. Last week, it took me all of ten minutes to ask United to credit me for flights I flew on SAS Airlines, and all of two days to credit my account. I flew Iberia Airlines in November - filled out my request for miles from American in December - didn't hear anything by March. So I asked again, and now I have been asked for receipt, name, boarding passes, and advantage number - three of which I have provided, and the receipt is really moot at this point. Honestly, I believe this whole issue is because I have an apostrophe in my last name. Every time I tried to add my AA number to the reservation before I left, I was told, ""The last names don't match"". This is ridiculous."
2925,"I cannot think of one good reason to fly American Airlines in the future. I cannot think of one reason to keep any credit card that only allows redemption on American as well. Customer service is becoming almost fight as they are not willing to negotiate or explain or accommodate customers anymore. I paid 178.00 cash to buy three thousand aadvantage miles for a $200 ticket, due to all the fees, they even rewarded me 5,000 miles for my purchase. Every single customer service rep I spoke with told me I should read all their fine print online to add up the fees prior to booking. I could not cancel even within the first 5 minutes. They are aggressive and used tactics trying to make me feel I was inadequate in my booking purchase. Yikes. No reason to fly with them again, their prices are not competitive and their rewards program is not user friendly nor offers half as many perks as other airlines. "
2926,"I gave AA a one star rating because I had to choose something. Otherwise, I would have given it a negative. This was my worst flying experience and my children's first flying experience. We were supposed to fly out Sunday morning at 7.45 am and due to a mechanical issue the flight was delayed (at first) and ended up getting cancelled. The next flight out was full, so we had to take the next available flight at 4.45. Spent all day at the airport waiting to start our Orlando vacation. I was thinking this would be the worst part of our trip - but it wasn't. On the way home - our flight was delayed yet again. We flew out 2 hours after our original flight was scheduled, which caused us to miss our connecting flight in Chicago. There were no later flights, so we had to stay overnight. When I asked them about a room, along with many other passengers, we were given a discounted rate at a hotel 15 miles from the airport. The discounted rate was $75 and they didn't offer to pay for a cab (the shuttle wasn't running this late). Rather than taking the room, we slept at the airport. Definitely not what you wish for your children's first flying experience."
2927,"The aircraft was old and dirty. The cabin crew did not engage with passengers, (they only seemed interested in chatting to each other about their layover in London). The aircraft was freezing cold but they refused to notice that the passengers were wrapped up in hoodies and blankets even though passengers complained. Tickets are expensive and additional charges are applied for a second suitcase, if you want to choose a seat and $9 for an alcoholic spirit! The food was nothing short of disgusting. Many passenger bought their own packed lunches. The IFE was like something out of the 70's. Overhead monitors with no choice of movie. Tiny in-ear headsets were begrudgingly handed out to passengers unfortunate enough not to have brought their own. American Airlines are complaining about unfair completion from middle east airlines. Given the choice I would fly on Emirates or Qatar every time!"
2928,"Every time I fly on an American Airlines they lose my luggage, and the planes are always broken. On my way back to MO last time, the plane was delayed in Phoenix for 4 hours, before they finally switched us to a new plane. They still managed to mess up getting my luggage back that night. This time, my flight left an hour late because of AC issues. When we land in Dallas for my transfer, I went from a 45 minute layover, to run as fast as I could to catch my gate. Got there as the door was closing. Turns out that didn't matter, because there was an issue with this plane too. Apparently, one seat was not functioning. I will never fly AA again. "
2929,"It took 37 hours to get to our destination. It was suppose to take 18, or so. My confirmed booked tickets, for my wife and I had two transfers. One in Dallas and one in London. In the end it was 3. Our plane to Heathrow was late and we missed our transfer, so when we got off our plane at Heathrow an American employee gave us new transfer tickets and told us to hurry to our next gate to catch it. So we ran to the next gate which took 30 minutes (Heathrow). When we got there my wife looked at the tickets and the layover was 4 hours. So why did the employee have us run? Because the flight was to Florence, not Pisa and they probably didn't want us to notice. So we went back through security (1.5 hours, Heathrow) and we got new tickets through American through British Airways to Pisa. We had about an hour wait after another run through security (1.5 hours) and back to the proper gate. So why didn't American put us on this flight in the first place? They work with British Airways to get customers to Pisa! Since we got back I contacted American about this issue, they sent us a voucher for $200 for a luggage mess up on the way home. It didn't have anything to do with the sending us to the wrong city."
2930,"I am a US college student currently in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I was traveling from Columbus, Ohio with connections in Washington and Miami. I board in Columbus without any problems however once on board I dealt with rude flight attendants. The flight to Washington arrives to DCA on time, I had enough time to board my flight to Miami, where I boarded without any problems but once again faced rude flight attendants. Arrive in Miami 20 minutes delayed where I was called up to the counter by an agent where I was asked to switch seats with another passenger because a family was traveling. I paid extra for this seat because all that was left was the preferred seating, I asked the agent if I would be moved to a preferred seat, she said yes. I get in line to board and am told rudely that I was in boarding group 4 and that they were only boarding group 1 at the moment. I paid extra to be in boarding group 1 and will never again switch seats with someone. Finally am able to board and the safety video plays on the screen on the backs of the seats. The pilot comes over saying that there are two minor problems that need to be taken care of before we can take off. After waiting for over an hour the pilot comes back over the intercom again to explain that we need to deplane. So we got off the plane and wait at the gate for another hour before we are finally told that the flight won't leave until 11.30 the next morning. After waiting forever to speak to the ticket agent and was only offered a transportation voucher. I had to pay for a hotel in Miami. "
2931,"American is usually okay for me but they aggravated me this time around. I'm assuming the airlines set the flight times. We had a 2 hour layover which is usually enough time but due to the size and unecessary complexity  I already reviewed the airport separately) of Miami airport, it was not enough time and we had to run to make final boarding call. I feel like an airline should understand times and how each airport is and should not schedule flights if they know it will be almost impossible for their customers. We were so close to not making it even though we were responsible with booking the layover times. If there is such a risk of passengers not making it don't schedule flights for those times! Part of the problem was the need to claim baggage and recheck it which we were not informed of when we booked the flights. It took far too long for our baggage to come and there was no one around to answer questions about whether or not more baggage was coming. Then after running to make it we still didn't take off on time. We sat for 30 mins at the gate while they fixed some problem in cargo. Some smaller complaints: they did not serve snacks on any of their flights for this trip and they did not show any good entertainment. They kept showing show after show instead of movies and not any good shows either that are popular."
2932,Anytime I have ever flown with American Airlines there has always been a way to go above and beyond of making flight travel as miserable as possible.  I'll give American Airlines the benefit of doubt. Not all of the people who work for American Airlines are rude. They will acknowledge you if you are persistent and polite enough. When I was at the Denver Airport I was not impressed with the agents. The flight crew did their best to help me. They were able to inform me that I would miss my connecting flight to Pittsburgh. There was only one agent who seemed to address my issue in concise and respectful manner - other agents were rude. I don't need outstanding customer service.
2933,"I haven't flown with AA for a while and my July flight to AA is the most horrible experience I have ever had. The aircraft is not clean and new compared to other airlines like UA or JetBlue. On my flight from Dallas to New York City, I was asked to check my carry on baggage before boarding (I am the last few to board) saying there is no enough over seat space. But after boarding the airplane, I found that there are much more space near my seat and there is no need to check my carry on. On my experience with JetBlue, the flight attendee will arrange the carry bag space for you. "
2934,"My plane was diverted from DFW to Shreveport, LA, left on the tarmac for almost 3 hours and then abruptly cancelled. No flights out meant that everyone was stuck and no rental cars were available. No help w/ hotel costs or car rental. Will never fly American again"
2935,"We were set to travel from Vegas to Dallas then to Orlando then to Gatwick. The nightmare started on our first flight, flight was delayed due to cabin crew being late, when we got to Dallas we had missed our connection due to the previous flight delay, we then get told we can go on the next flight but it was fully booked so we would be put on standby. We made them aware we had more connections to get to, they couldn't of cared less! After my partner explaining we needed to get home due to commitments etc they put us on a direct flight, after they booked it then told us it was to Heathrow airport which is 45 mins from where our car was in Gatwick. Advised that the airline would pay for our bus journey so we took it. When we arrived in Heathrow our nightmare continued as American airlines had now lost our luggage. When we realised the luggage was missing we went to a help desk just to file a report and to be told to go home and our luggage should arrive later that day and all will be ok. Well I've been home a day now and numerous phone calls to American Airlines have not been helpful to us."
2936,"Flight from Boston to O'Hare, fair to good. Basic experience. AA did not handle the flight delay well in O'Hare - assigning late inbound pilots who were near time-out for active service on an already delayed departure flight to an airport with a curfew time. O'Hare frequently has runway holds and queues to make things even later. We ultimately returned to a different gate due to timed-out pilots for our now cancelled flight but then they didn't have the staffing available to open the gate and get us started with rescheduling flights for an additional 20 minutes - blowing any chance of catching some of the last flights to Southern California for the night. It was just one setback after another. My recommendation, if your flying AA - stick with the hub in DFW, at least they may have the extra resources there to keep things moving. I was dumbfounded by the decision tree and mitigation process for the not so uncommon event of a cancelled flight at O'Hare. No hotel help, a silly dinner voucher for some restaurant that might be open in the terminal after midnight, and just not a whole lot of explanation. Yes, the rain did cause part of the delay, but really no responsibility was attributed to the airline for the other factors that weighed into the cancellation. I am now flying home on a competitor along with at least 5 others I recognize from that fateful night."
2937,"A depressing experience. Flight delayed nearly 4 hours with no explanation. We went through a secondary security check so water purchased after primary security was confiscated. I should be grateful that AA takes security seriously but several people came through that check with water not found by the baggage checkers. The cabin crew were rude, unfriendly and very unapproachable especially when we needed water. There were passengers in the front seats who we assumed were airline employees. They were given priority treatment with much joking with the crew. All very unprofessional. At take-off and landing there was very little attempt to ensure seat-belts fastened or seats upright. To get on to a British Airways ongoing from Miami was a true joy."
2938,"Flew from Vegas to Chicago O'Hare, en route to Buffalo. Was informed via voicemail my next flight was delayed and then another canceling. I called the given number to get booked for the next flight it was not until 8.30 am. She said I would get info through email that never came. They had cots present to sleep on but failed to mention they wake you up at 4am. Sat at my gate for 4 hours just to find out they had changed it without me knowing about it so I had to run to my next gate. I got there with 10 minutes to spare but they closed the gate, would not let me on, and said that my ticket had not been issued when I had it present on my phone. Next flight was not until 3 pm, luckily was on standby at 12 pm where I managed to get on an ""overfull"" plane last minute. Arrived home 14 hours later than I paid for. Used their gogo service and paid $6 for a movie that cut off after 30 minutes, no refund. They don't even offer complimentary peanuts on a 4 hour flight. Never will fly with them again."
2939,"Our flight was delayed 5 hours due to a bad computer part. We were repeatedly given inaccurate information about the length of the delay. Told AA had to get the part from UA, then told part had to be flown in. Then part was on UA plane in hangar. Told it would take 5 minutes to swap out. Took an hour to remove, another hour to install and then testing began. After 2 hours of delay, given $12 meal voucher. You can't even buy a pre-made sandwich at ORD for that amount. Missed our connection and the rebooked one too. Trip that should have been 16 hours to my home took 24 hours. AA gave me 5000 air miles, which costs them nothing. "
2940,"Pleasantly surprised at how comfortable the flight was. Plenty of leg space, great overhead lighting, great seat back entertainment. I had asked for a vegetarian meal - which showed up and was delicious."
2941,"ORD-MSY, 1st July. Online check-in was swift and simple, no delays and friendly ground and air crew. Basic plane so no wifi or IFE but it was only a 1.5 hour flight so can't really complain. A bit of a bumpy landing in the rain but very well-handled by captain and crew. Was served a complimentary drink but no food, but again only a 1.5 hour flight. Would happily recommend AA to others."
2942,"First they changed my flight time in London so my layover was 5 hours, then I get to Chicago and they wait until the last minute to change the gate which was a 15 walk from the original gate. They changed my flight time there to another 5 hour layover then the flight was delayed again to leave at 9 pm. Because of AA my travel time was 31 hours in length with no apologies. No one wants to help or answer any questions they don't care about the passenger I will never fly AA again."
2943,"Awful plane, dirty, very cold, unresponsive crew. I am platinum with this lot but it is out of necessity. American Airlines really is the bottom of the barrel."
2944,"First Class on A321 Transcon. Ground service was excellent. Flagship Check-In was fantastic, very spacious and modern space away from the crowd. After check-in, I was escorted to the front of the TSA Pre-Check Line and was done with security in two minutes, although I wish the agent was more jovial. Flagship Lounge great with plenty of breakfast options and an extensive beverage selection. The lounge was not crowded. Seating was comfortable and WiFi was fast. Overall, a great space with much better food and drinks than the regular lounge. Flight was good. Seats were spacious with tons of storage. Power ports, USB plugs, remote control and a bunch of other features located by your seat. Seat was private, minor complaint would be the firmness, wish there were a lot more soft like the ones they have on the Boeing 767-300s. TV screens were huge, great interactive map with plenty of entertainment options. The purser was interactive and friendly, although they lack some finesse. She dropped my appetizer on the floor and constantly spilled liquid on my tray table.  Food in abundance, they also introduced a new menu that I got to try out. Appetizer, main and dessert were all good quality, although nothing memorable. Salad was extremely disappointing. It tasted and looked like leftovers from a prepackaged bag of salad and the dressing was oily. Overall, food could have been better although for a flagship route, American should step up their game, considering Delta offers excellent inflight meals on shorter flights. All in all, the flight was great. Excellent ground service, good service, great seat, although food needs some improvement."
2945,"The flight was okay. Legroom fine, snacks were okay, the average you would expect from a domestic flight. However, let me emphasize on the poor baggage handling on this flight. We arrived at the Terminal, 4-5 hours before boarding time, just to be sure. We were allowed to check-in. However, upon arrival at our final destination (STL), our bags were not with the plane. They were not on any of our flights! As it turns out, our bags never left New York.  We thought that being very early for our flight guaranteed every detail to be fine, including our luggage. However this event was truly a disappointment.  I still would recommend this airline to other people, as my other flights were fairly average, and didn't go wrong like this one."
2946,"Toilets were fine, seating was good. Food average (but at least there was food!). Great staff, pilots and overall a good experience. Some issues with our baggage as it appears our baggage never left New York (ORD to STL was a connecting flight from JFK). This issue was resolved quickly as our 4 pieces of luggage were delivered free to the place we were staying at in St Louis. Overall, our flight with American was fine."
2947,"Firstly, the transatlantic flight from BHX to JFK had no IFE, the staff service was inefficient and toilets dirty. Why on earth use a glorified 737 for long haul? After the flight from NYC to Dallas, which was delayed by 1hr, the final leg - Dallas to Lima was the same as above - with the added extra of a broken AC socket. Now I have found out that American have taken us off the return flight of MIA to JFK (then BHX) and given us a detour of MIA to ORD, ORD to JFK, so now have 3 stopovers, without notifying us. Awful."
2948,"This was the worst experience I have had with an airline and if at all possible, I will choose another airline for my next travel plans. We had a delay and then cancelation going to Montego Bay and the same (but worse) on the return flight. On the return home, we missed our connecting flight in Charlotte because there was congestion on the runway. The next flight was not for three hours. Then that plane was late and needed repairs, so after seven hours in the airport, we finally got on a plane to fly the 45 minutes from Charlotte to Atlanta. The airline offered us nothing, no vouchers or anything else, for causing us to miss our connecting flight. We just got attitude from the employees."
2949,"We arrived at Reagan Airport from LaGuardia to connect to an 8.40 am flight to Los Angeles. Predictably, the flight was late arriving, which was fine, as the connecting flight to LAX also was delayed. To 10 am. Then 11 am. Then the sign at the gate said to check at 3 pm. The aircraft was having ""maintenance"" issues which I learned only by calling the Platinum Desk. The plane was removed from the gate and taken back to the hangar. We were told we'd be boarding at 3.30 pm. And some of us - perhaps 10 - did board, only to be told to disembark. The pilot had ""timed out"" after waiting around all day like the rest of us. A few minutes before 4 pm, another pilot showed up and boarded the plane, but he strode off after a few minutes. The flight was then canceled altogether. I managed to secure a seat on a 6.17 pm flight to LAX via Chicago. In the meantime, I complained to a gate agent about the inadequate service and ""surly, ill-mannered, uncommunicative"" agents. The flight to Chicago eventually took off, and we connected from there to LAX, arriving at the California airport around 11.15 pm. My original itinerary had me arriving at 11.29 am. No explanations, apologies nor compensation. Just an awful experience all-round - and all too typical."
2950,"Coming off flights with Qatar Airways, I was on my last leg to New York with American Airlines. To start, the boarding began 20 minutes late because a previous American Airlines flight to Seattle was delayed. CDG is a shocking airport. I wasn't looking forward to the old B767 that we would fly either. But flight took off on time and wasn't that bad. I slept most of the time, partly due to a lack of personal entertainment. The only entertainment was an overhead screen showing some terrible movie. Crew was good, particularly one. Can't remember his name but you'll know when you meet him. Food was okay, main meal was decent, the ice-cream and snacks were excellent. Flight landed on time. So all in all a very average flight, but I won't recommend it."
2951,"Our flight from Miami to Boston was supposed to depart at 7.45. We did not leave the airport until after midnight. Nobody was offered an explanation as to why we were delayed. We had not one, but 3 gate changes, and our party was traveling with someone who needed assistance. The airport in Miami is huge and after the last gate change, we were told that our flight would leave in 30 min. The AA agent made one phone call for assistance and then left us to our own devices. We had to frantically scramble to find a golf cart, wheelchair, someone to assist. Many of the other passengers on the flight were outraged and not one AA representative gave us any reason why our flight kept getting postponed. Finally, when we boarded at 11.30, the pilot explained that extreme weather kept us from leaving on time. Not sure if I buy this explanation, as other flights departed, but at least he offered an explanation and an apology. Not even a packet of peanuts. Our original departure point was Aruba, and we'll fly JetBlue next time."
2952,"Flight cancelled from JFK to Cancun. I have had mobile app downloaded from American Airline's website that told me all the time the flight was on schedule. Arrived at airport to see on the boards that flight cancelled. Directed to counters to deal with and maybe try and book next flight. No apology, staff were unhelpful and counter staff downright ""offish"" to the situation. I was even told the mobile app doesn't communicate with flight counter so its information can be incorrect. So the question is what's the point of the app if doesn't provide up-to-date info. Flight booked for next day. So we incurred cost of overnight near JFK and incurred cost of night at destination. No offer to assist with accommodation for overnight caused by the cancellation. We were made to feel as if we as the customer was an intrusion to the non-operation of this flight. I lost my confidence with the airline, and return flight from Cancun to Dallas, the flight was delayed by almost three hours. So we had cancelled flight, then our scheduled return flight to connect with another international flight was delayed by hours."
2953,"Flew American Airlines from Tokyo to Chicago, 11-hour flight. We were a little delayed, but that didn't matter, the pilots did their best to make up for it and we arrived 45 minutes before the estimated arrival time. The flight was full, and as usual, the airspace around Tokyo Narita was congested, and there were about 7 planes queuing in front of us to take off. The little TV screen monitor that they had on the seat in front of me was tiny, and didn't have very many shows to watch. But, the staff were extremely friendly, and they had multiple drink options. I was seated in the window seat of row 41, and I had to try to climb over the person sitting next to me, who was sleeping, in which I failed. If you can find a flight with another airline, I'd probably take it."
2954,"Booked 5 American Airlines flights on January 13, 2015 for 4 of us going fishing in Alaska, flight out on June 24 and return on June 25. Called airline reservations agent in order to book flight and to specifically book seat assignments. Received confirmation January 13, 2015 for all. American Airlines changes outbound flights to a different route on May 20. Did on-line check-in on June 23 and discovered there were no seat assignments - AA refused to acknowledge or change to requested seats. AA as usual requests kiosk check-in at airport, even though we had boarding passes in hand. Newly kiosk issued boarding passes were not acceptable at any of the boarding gates and we had to re-check in at the boarding gate to receive a gate acceptable boarding pass. Bad, unpleasant, un-acceptable experience."
2955,"We didn't fly from Manchester to New York as the flight was cancelled. We sat on the runway for 2 hours whilst the pilot waited for maintenance staff. We were then de-planed without a single apology from the staff. We had to go back through airport security as if we had arrived in the country! All our duty free was taken off us. We then had to re-queue at check-in for over an hour and a half, staff were rude, brusque and aloof. Told that our only options were to cancel altogether or fly 9.5 hours later to Heathrow via British Airways. As we only had 3 nights in New York we would lose a third of our trip. We asked to come back a day later so we would actually get the trip that we had paid for, meaning adding on the day we lost onto the end of our holiday but they wouldn't honour this. We had to pay for our own additional night at the hotel in New York which they gave us 15 minutes to decide and organise. We flew back with American Airlines at the end of our trip and even on this flight staff did not smile and were brusque. "
2956,"My family had the most frustrating experience trying to fly to Toronto for a week-long vacation with United Airways (post-American Airlines merger). We bought tickets a month before our flight and ended up paying almost $700 each roundtrip (for 4 of us). On June 21st we drove 2 hours to Charlotte Airport and on our way we got an automated call telling us our flight had been cancelled for maintenance (at around 11.30) on a beautiful, clear day. Not knowing what to do we continued to the airport terminal and through the check-in line. The employee at the check-in said we had been rescheduled on a flight for the next day at 5.30am. This wasn't an acceptable alternative for us so we were put on standby for a 4.30 flight but then we had to check-in our stowaway luggage. We asked how we would get our luggage back if we didn't make it on the 4.30 flight, and were told that the luggage was marked for standby and would not be put on the plane without us. Past security we checked with other United Airways employees who assured us this was the case. These employees were all helpful and patient with us. We waited in the airport for hours for the standby flight, which unsurprisingly did not have space for all 4 of us. We were sent to baggage claim and waited for luggage that never showed up. Our bags had been sent to Toronto YYZ without us. I called Toronto Pearson airport where a helpful woman connected me to the United Airways baggage office. Finally I was satisfied that they probably weren't going to send our luggage back to Charlotte, and we drove up north. At Toronto Pearsons we found customer service who made a call and told us exactly where to find our luggage. A 1/10 rating is generous."
2957,I flew out from Pensacola on June 23rd at 4pm. What was supposed to be a connecting flight in North Carolina turned into a disaster. My flight kept getting delayed with minimal communication of when our flight would be taking off. The flight time continued to change and hours passed by with little communication as to why. The flight that was suppose to board at 9.40pm did not get cancelled until just before 2am. I had already been traveling for 14 hours. I waited in a ridiculously long line only to be told that the hotels in the area were all booked and that the cots at the airport were taken. I did not sleep at all. I had to re-route my original flight from LAX twice because one of the workers routed me to San Jose which was 6 hours away from my destination (LAX). They re-routed me again an hour out of the way at John Wayne airport and had to find someone else to pick me up because of the change of my arrival. When I arrived my checked bag was nowhere to be found. My bag arrived a few days later. I have flown with US Airways / American Airlines many times but this customer service is completely unacceptable.
2958,"American Airlines displayed appalling customer service to its stranded passengers in PHL on the evening of 30 June 2015. Several of us were late by minutes to connecting flights to Europe, after being encouraged to run to catch our connections, all flights left without the 15-20 of us. These things sometimes happen, but what followed was not acceptable. Customer service representatives had no solutions for anyone, other than bookings for the next flight 24 hours later. No hotel, transportation, nothing. My service at the desk was dismissive: we can't help. We have no solutions or contingencies. It was only after my pestering them, when she handed me the dreaded ""pink slip"" - a generic phone number and website for ""discount"" on a hotel. The biggest problem is that customer service failed spectacularly at the point where the client is most vulnerable and alone-in transit. There should be a representative for each imperiled connecting flight, or group of flights. On-ground coordinators should be communicating with gate agents and in-flight attendants. Even when connections are simply impossible, let us know and give us options, at the point of debarkation. All it takes is for someone to actively monitor and question the line. "
2959,"They decided to detour and refuel the plane in Austin. As a result, the plane arrived almost half an hour after my connecting flight to LHR had already left. I was told the next flight wasn't until 3.30 pm the next day (being today, I'm sitting in the airport), leaving me almost 14 hours between flights. I couldn't afford a hotel. I was given no vouchers for food or anything else, was given minimal assistance, just a slip of paper and ""hope they have room for you on the next one"". Re-figuring my pick-up at Heathrow was more expensive and inconvenient than I could really afford. The airline was less than apathetic. The entire experience has been appalling."
2960,"We booked a companion certificate through the old US airways. We missed the outbound flight and had to take an alternative one way flight. When checking back in for the original return flight, American said there was no reservation in the system. As a result of not making the first flight, American told us we broke the contract, they canceled our reservation without notification to us and we had to purchase another full fare one way flight to get home. In addition, we were stranded for two more nights in the airport hotel. This was insane! Who treats their frequent flyer passengers and credit card holders this way?"
2961,"We were overcharged for checking a 7th bag on a ticket of 5 people. Even after I explained to the ticket AA agent that the charge should only be $40, she still insisted on charging us $150. When our flight on June 25 (2971) from ORD to MLI was canceled due to mechanical issues, we were given incorrect information from multiple AA gate agents (ie. couldn't provide a rental car, couldn't rebook us on another airline, couldn't get us out of ORD until two days later), and after finally connecting with an AA representative on the phone (more than a 2 hour wait), we were told that we were indeed overcharged for our bag, and we should have been offered voucher per ticket because our flight was canceled due to mechanical issues, which caused more than a 5.5 hour delay. We were neither told this, nor were the gate agents helpful in trying to resolve the issue. We were told we couldn't file for a refund over the telephone and had to submit an email on the AA website, which I did four days ago -  still have not heard back from anyone yet. "
2962,"I traveled with my wife to Paris (CDG) from Boston on June 14 on AA146. The attention was mediocre and even forgot to give my breakfast or snack.  On the return flight on June 26 from London to New York flight AA107 the service was better, like the food, plane with plenty of room for the feet and service better than normal. "
2963,"Both flights to and from destination had delays. First flight was almost 2 hours delayed due to mechanical failure, we ended up boarding a new plane, then sitting on the runway for another 20 minutes. Return flight didn't have working DC outlet under seat, and GoGo flight entertainment application wouldn't work on the phone, a terrible application.  This isn't the first time I have had delays with AA (2+ hours delay due to Mechanical failure on a flight to Cancun via DFW) and if I keep on flying with them, I would assume it wouldn't be the last. Other customers were voicing the same complaints."
2964,My flight from London to Chicago was in an ancient plane with no in-flight entertainment. The crew were not very friendly and the food was poor. I was told I would have to pay for spirits (on a long-haul flight!). I would avoid where possible.
2965,"It was about 82 degrees on the flight home tonight. FA's didn't seem to care about passenger comfort. Passengers were complaining about the air. Television at our seat was intermittently working. This airline needs an overhaul, sadly, just when I'm about to achieve status. "
2966,"You get what you pay for, is how I feel after my second trip with American Airlines. But to be honest, was expecting a worse so I was pleasantly surprised. Flights were on time. Food and drinks were served during the flight. Wine, beer and soft drinks were served for free. Staff was polite, efficient and a few almost friendly. Plane new and clean. Water and juice or soft drinks were left available overnight to be self served. Lots of movies for entertainment. But Online check in was impossible. Especially with a connecting flight (even OneWorld one). Ground service was badly arranged at LAX. No signs or staff to seek help from. Seats in economy uncomfortable. Leg room absolutely minimum for a long-haul flight. Entertainment system worked well but selection in music was terrible. Screen didn't turn so when seats are reclined it's almost impossible to watch anything on it. Quality, taste and portion size of food was a little disappointing. At the end of the day we got where we wanted to go. On time. With no sleep but very, very cheap."
2967,"We travel every 1-2 years internationally and often use American because of the flight availability out of Tulsa. Two years ago we flew Delta business class while we chose American business class this time - the difference was startling. Delta was great service, great seats, great food. American Airlines seats were nowhere near as comfortable, the amenity bag was a relative joke, food was acceptable but not as good. The staff were less helpful. almost every flight was late to some degree which meant having to rush to connections. They did a fairly good job in O'Hare of expediting the process. the flight out of O'Hare was one class and despite paying for business class, we received nothing."
2968,"Flight #116 departing Maui on June 22 at 8:35pm was delayed 3.5 hours. All the restaurants and stores at Maui close at 10pm. We asked the flight attendant for one bottle of water to share amongst the four of us (me, my husband, and 2 children) when boarding the flight at 12:15am and were told they have a limited amount for the flight and do not give bottles to customers. Plane had no power outlets in economy class cabin.  Even though DFW is closer to my home I will make the extra drive to Love Field and take Virgin to LAX and connect with Hawaiian on my next Hawaii trip. "
2969,"American Airlines has improved for US domestic travel. I would say 90% of staff encounters I have are upbeat, courteous and professional.  I don't know how it's going to be after US Air is fully integrated, but for now I am happy with the new planes, mostly professional FA's, helpful gate agents. There's a tiny part of me that's tempted to try them on an overseas flight, but maybe that's a bridge too far."
2970,"I chose to fly American Airlines because they offered the cheapest flight at the time I booked. I wish I would have paid the extra money to fly another airline now. While leaving Louisiana we boarded the plane twice only to be told to go back and wait in the terminal. We were not informed as to what was going on and when asked if I would make my connecting flight in Dallas I was told that I would find out when I got there. When landing in Dallas I had an hour to get to my other flight (or so I thought). We sat on the runway for over an hour, which of course we were not informed as to what was taking so long. The only thing that made the flight bearable is the fact there was movie service from the flight from Dallas to Las Vegas ($8 for a movie). I attempted to just check in online for my flight leaving tomorrow morning only to find out it told me my request could not be processed and I had to check in at the airport. I called the customer information number listed on the website only to be told it wasn't processing because I did not have a seat on my connecting flight from Dallas to Monroe. To say the least, I will never fly American Airlines again. I will spend the extra money on an airline that I trust and is less stressful to travel with."
2971,"What a difference a new plane can make. New seat is comfortable and well designed, sat in a reverse facing seat but did not feel out of place. Crew very friendly. Enjoyed the walk up bar area. Food excellent and AVOD same quality as new 777. Took a while to get used to the window shades as people darkened the window to their preference. "
2972,"I have never encountered less friendly cabin crew than the ones supposedly serving on our flight from Miami to London on June 19th, 2015. That lot was comparable with perhaps the Aeroflot ""of old"", whereas today you get a smile out of Aeroflot crew. American Airlines has a lot to do in this respect, if they even care. I would feel embarrassed to work for AA, it is a pity that the customers are more polite than their staff."
2973,"Chicago to Manchester on Boeing 767. After an unexplained three hour delay, which kept being pushed back 15 minutes, then waiting for further updates, whilst all passengers ready and waiting at the gate, it transpired that we were waiting for cargo to be loaded at the inconvenience of fare paying passengers. Economy class has tired, hard, uncomfortable seats, limited leg room. No personal TV, just overhead TV showing (bizarrely, childrens films). Cabin staff were surly, not a smile between them. All older staff, and so rude at times. The way the breakfast boxes were thrown out was embarrassing, customer service was non-existent. No offers of second drinks, all they seemed to want to do was to get the meal service over so that they could sit down and rest. During the night time hours, it was freezing cold, even the blanket did not suffice to keep me warm. Strangely, they kept turning the lights on every now and then, so sleep was impossible. Probably the worst airline for onboard customer service I have ever encountered."
2974,"JFK-BOS-LGA. Lounge at JFK and BOS great. Complimentary snacks limited but bar menu great and quality excellent. Onboard service personable, flight attendants very interactive. Seats were good on the B737 and drinks were plentiful despite the length. My only complaint is on the return flight, the seats were a tad hard and aircraft needed a lot of attention. They could also improve on the snack selections onboard. "
2975,"The  friendly cabin crew and comfort of this new looking aircraft, in particular the amount of leg-room in economy, surprised me. Entertainment options were good (passenger pays) and the food for purchase was much better quality than I expected. Better product all round than the Air Canada flight taken a few days earlier LA-Toronto."
2976,"The seats were uncomfortable, service was a straight menu with just 3 types of drinks (coca-cola, water, and orange juice). The seats did not have a screen, and the general screen failed and no one can listen when the safety video was played. The crew did not give us something to drink, and no headphones."
2977,"A window seat was paid for, confirmed, and I had paperwork proving this, but when checking me in American Airlines randomly changed my seat. When I questioned the service representative at terminal D5 her response was, ""well I don't have a window seat to change it to sorry."" I will never fly AA again. Terrible customer service, very disorganized and rude."
2978,"Throughout my recent trip, there were difficulties due to under-staffing at the terminals and ticket check-in, leading to several long delays. Several of us missed our first flight out of Gainesville since there was miscommunication leading to no one being at the check-out counter prior to our departure and none of the boarding pass kiosks working. The return flights were equally difficult, with only 1 kiosk working and only one person working the ticket counter, which lead to check-in requiring about an hour. Several of the initial flights were delayed, leading to several of us missing our connection. While this is understandable and does occur at times, it took approximately 2 hours to receive our hotel vouchers even though the flight arrangements were made prior. This was again due to being under-staffed as only 1 person was working this terminal. The following day, multiple flights were cancelled due to ""mechanical difficulties"" leading several of us to again miss our flights. This again lead to an almost 2 hour wait in order to re-book after already waiting an hour prior to the flight being cancelled, causing many of us to miss our chance at making a compatible connection flight. I was initially told I would again have to stay over-night and was not given further options. After calling customer service myself, I found a flight to an airport 2.5 hours away although I was required to pay the rental car fee to drive back home. In summary, due to consistent under-staffing, there were numerous long waits which ultimately delayed travel planned. This combined with several flight delays (due to mechanical difficulties - not weather), lead do my initial flight leaving a day late and my return flight being delayed 2 additional days. I travel fairly regularly, and have never ran across this issue previously. I will avoid using American Airlines in the future if possible."
2979,"Day and night difference! US Air to Portugal was a nightmare and I was not looking forward to the return via AA. But there was a difference! The crew all were smiling and were friendly as we entered, our seats had not been changed as US Air had done and the plane was clean and almost comfortable. I am 6'2"" tall and 315 lbs, they provided an extention without even a request for me and the tv/video screens were present and operational. Interior temps were comfortable and the food service was pleasant as well as edible. The crew was present and friendly all day. I would fly AA again but never their counterpart US Air again."
2980,"First, the good. The customer service was friendly and engaging. They checked my bag for free because of my military service and put my girlfriend's bad under my name too. Good deal. Well, that's about all. I accidentally went to the wrong airlines line for me and my girlfriend to check our bags so we were running a little behind. That was my bad. Now, the bad for them. The flight was canceled. The delay was exceptional. Before I even knew that, there were two workers behind the counter and both were tied up. One had a problem with an international traveler couple. Second, a family had their flight canceled or rescheduled. American was attempting to help but the mother refused the offer of a taxi because she requested a carseat (which is understandable). Things slowed to a crawl at this point. Now we resume to a positive note. Did I mention the staff was friendly earlier? Yes, they were nice. Disclaimer: I reviewed this prior to boarding."
2981,"Poor customer service after the returning flight was delayed. It took 48 hours, another delayed plane, a trip to Miami, then Charlotte, then Detroit! To get from Tampa Florida to Louisville Kentucky. You can drive it in 10. No one in customer service in Miami spoke understandable English. Not one person! And all I get from American Airline is ""We know you are disappointed"" and ""We are confident we can do a great deal better""."
2982,"I can't believe what a dissapointment this company has became, I had a flight from NYC to Memphis, on Friday 12th, my flight was cancelled at the last minute without any explanation. I catch a early flight in the morning of the 13th, then I have my return flight from Memphis to NYC on the 14TH June. When I got to DCA my flight was delayed and as always at the last minute they cancelled my flight, they didn't even give us a hotel room., I slept at the airport thinking I would leave the airport first thing in the morning, to my surprise I didn't, they put me on another flight with US Airways which was the same, as I was waiting for my flight, they cancelled again, then they put me on an AA flight leaving at 9.47 am and now is leaving at 10."
2983,"The worst exeprience I have had. Completly disorganized routes. In 1 day 2 delayed flights, one with 4hr, second one with 2hr delay. Next to that 2 changes of gates - terrible!"
2984,"First trip on the reconfigured B777 business class and I was impressed. Virtually identical to the CX layout, which I love. Quite a bit of privacy and personal space, with a very comfortable flat bed. IFE had ample choices, and the food and beverage was good as well. In flight overseas WiFi worked very well also. Flagship check in at LHR in a separate and dedicated building makes the process very easy. I think AA has upped their game on the overseas routes - perhaps not all - but this was an excellent trip."
2985,"First overseas trip in the newly configured B767 with flat beds. The cabin looks very crisp, clean, and modern but I found the seats to be uncomfortable and poorly designed. The seats seem very narrow, and once in the flat bed position your feet end up in a narrow, confining box-like area which makes it difficult to move around. Impacted sleep quality immensely. Tablet-based IFE strange, clunky with limited choices. The biggest positive surprise was the food, which was as good an airline meal as I've had. Perfectly roasted duck breast in a coconut lime curry was restaurant quality, salads fresh and crisp. On balance better than expected and an improvement for AA."
2986,"AA has completely lost my trust. The woman at the check in counter knew nothing about free bags for military civilians. After paying for our bag, she gave us our boarding pass and mentioned nothing about it being delayed. We found out after I noticed that the time was different on our boarding pass. When the time came to board, we find out that the flight is cancelled when we noticed no plane at our gate. We approached some AA attendants and the woman apologized for forgetting to announce it, and then looked for another flight for us. She found one for a 5am flight - 4.30am check in and gave us a hotel voucher of which the shuttle runs every half hour. That means we would have to leave the hotel at 3am in order to make the flight. At 2.30am, my boyfriend finds out through the flight tracker to discover it is cancelled again! He tries to call customer service to reschedule but had a 1 hour wait time on the phone. When he finally gets through, the man on the phone suggested a flight at JFK at 7am, which we wouldn't be able to make it in time even if we left at that moment (3.40) because we would have to wait for the (every 30 min) shuttle, get on the airport train, get to the stop for long term parking, then get the bus to get us to our car, and then drive over an hour to JFK. So then he puts us on a 3.50 flight to Chicago getting us there at nearly 6pm. Our whole Saturday is gone. AA wasted us a lot of money and time. I will never fly with them again. "
2987,"What has happened? Airlines have revolved into greedy money making machines and in turn allowed people to become smug and uncaring for others. What used to happen in my day when a person of 6ft 5ins boarded a plane there was consideration and care? Now it is all about extra money! I distinctly remember when this situation arose we would kindly ask smaller exit seated passengers to swap and 9 times out of ten people would be happy to do so. We maybe would offer a few drinks in return and everyone was happy. My son who is 6ft 5in was like a caged animal on our recent American Airlines flight, 10 hours of absolute hell. Yes we could have paid more for an exit seat but he is a student and this was not an option. While shorter passengers get seats for less he is now faced with either having to pay more to travel than shorter people or not travel at all. It is not as if he can do anything about his height, if he was simply overweight – then he could diet – but this is not the case. American Airlines allowed him to stand up all the way from LA to LHR for 10 hours, when he had to sit his legs had to be wide apart and any chance of a brace position would be completely ruled out. American Airlines – shame on you for your greed! I am not sure why trolleys were used for the meal service – they could have just chucked boxes of junk down the cabin and asked those interested to catch them. "
2988,"I flew non-stop from SLC to MIA on a redeye, 4 hours of flight time, no problems, delighted to find a non-stop flight. A week later, coming home, (June 10 2015) was a totally different experience.  The flight to DFW was delayed for a mechanical problem (air speed indicator), so they re-boarded us on a different plane, but after all
passengers were seated and the safety video shown, they said there was another mechanical problem (didn't identify it) and sent all 200 of us to a re-booking desk which couldn't possibly accommodate all of us.  Meanwhile after an hour standing in line, they called us back to the second airplane and the ones of us who hadn't left in search of another flight, toted rolling bags etc on board yet a third time and we sat and continued to wait while the baggage was loaded. This leg of the trip had begun with the supposed 12.25 pm departure of Flight 2407, but by now it was 5.30 pm, with no signs of hope. I knew I'd already missed my connecting flight to SLC, and was able to book another DFW flight for 6 pm.  I made it in time to board this different flight, but the 6.00 departure time turned out to be 7.00pm.  The delay here was for yet another unexplained reason.  Still,  I was able at DFW to make my connecting flight to SLC on a 10.00 flight, but this interminable day stretched out far longer than it should have, and I don't see how it could be, that every single AA flight I was on that day, all had delays. The staff were friendly and helpful, but, I can't recommend this airline. "
2989,"A friend and I flew JFK-BOS-MIA-CUR last minute and at an incredibly low cost. BOS-MIA we got 'upgraded' to Main Cabin Extra for no apparent reason. Check in was actually surprisingly smooth and efficient, friendly staff. Out of the 12 Cabin Crew on the 3 legs 9 didn't spare a smile, didn't manage to finish the 'service' (consisting of 1 complimentary drink) and seemed to be tired and/or just hated their job. 2 were plain rude to fellow passengers for no apparent reason as well as unprofessional and only 1 of the 12 was outstandingly nice and cheery as well as professional. Aircraft old but decent enough, no entertainment (one leg not even safety demonstration after all screens didn't work). On ground experience and price top, inflight flop."
2990,"This is the 3rd time this year that I have flown with American Airline, I give this airline 1 star out of 5 stars. Number 1 reason is this airline has constant delays all across the board, every flight I have flown on has been late or delayed for the past 3 times this year. I will never fly with this airline again. I am extremely dissatisfied with the quality of service and the delays they have for every flight."
2991,"Just returned from a trip to the Caymans for a wedding, and as usual had a bad experience on American.  I had hoped that the pending merger would improve Americans quality, but instead I'm afraid it will make USAir worse.  I used miles and flew business class on USAir - cost 120,000!  The plane was actually an American plane, and was dirty, with torn, worn out, uncomfortable seats. Service was marginal.  I keep having bad experiences on American, and have actually decided to use up my miles and change to another carrier - it is sad to see how airline travel has degraded - dirty, worn out, cramped, buses with wings."
2992,I travelled to and back from LGA. Going was actually with US Airways. The staff on both journeys were rude although the LGA to LHR flights were better. Going to LGA staff were rude and not helpful when serving food. The entertainment system was okay although have seen better the touch screens do not work properly. I was sat at the front so luckily had good space however the other seats seemed tight. The second part of the flight (domestic one) was a two by two carrier and the tiniest aircraft I had seen. I would not recommend and I would avoid at all costs.
2993,My husband and I flew to London in business class on 4/29/2015. Plane was old business class seats were too close to each other the food was the worst ever. Toilets were dirty. We will never fly American Airlines business class anymore. Very unsatisfied customers. We usually fly Qantas business to the U.S. from Australia and let me tell you that it is a first class airline! I'm flying back to London on July 9 business class flying with BA never again AA. Very dissatisfied customers.
2994,American Airlines without notification or reason cancelled my ticket on the return leg of my trip leaving me stranded. The flight to Seattle from Philadelphia went smoothly. I was able to check in board and fly without problem and it was actually one of my most pleasant flights. However when I tried to check in for the return flight I was informed that my ticket had been cancelled. After waiting on hold for a long time one of the American Airlines representatives informed me that the ticket was cancelled because I never boarded the plane in Philadelphia. Eventually I was told that if I showed my boarding pass from the flight from Philadelphia to Seattle to a check-in representative they would be able to book a seat on the flight for me. However until that time the seat was not reserved for me or guaranteed in any way. It was important that I make the flight in order to be at work so I had to make an extra trip to the airport early so I could re-book my ticket thereby wasting precious vacation time. So do not fly on American Airlines unless you enjoy the thrill of not knowing if you'll get to use the ticket you bought the mystery of whether the airline knows you're on the plane or not and the excitement of using vacation time to pick your way through a companies complex inaccessible and unable customer service system.
2995,First Class JFK - Seattle June 1. Although the flight was delayed almost two hours due to a combination of weather aircraft delays etc.. the flight was fine. The JFK ground crew worked with a combination of humor and professionalism that provided the right touch at the gate and once the aircraft arrived everyone worked very quickly to get us on our way. Once in flight we had warm service in the small front cabin (737-800) by two experienced yet friendly attendants. The food was definitely an upgrade from recent trips and all in all I felt American did a good job. Baggage delivery at Sea-Tac was awful.
2996,May 14th AA63. May 21st AA62. Paris-Miami Economy: the worst experience I have had for a long distance flight. I was lucky to get the seats with more space without paying as I was one of the last ones to check in. The airplane was so old that it is difficult to put a small bag inside the plane. What's more shocking is not having an individual screen for each passenger. moreover on the Paris-Miami flight the steward was not nice at all. While the hostess gave me a can of coke he only gave me a glass. The food was ok but very low quality compared to the price paid. On the return flight the food was just terrible no comment I did not eat it. Of course same thing on the return flight no screens and very old plane. The seat in front of me was all torn. I have tried many other airlines for long distance flights being in Europe or Asia and none of them were as bad as this one.
2997,"Flew with my wife from Seattle to Charleston with stops in DFW and DCA. Selected the least expensive flights and we are not frequent travelers so I did not expect a great experience. Our flights did get rescheduled probably due to the merger with US Airways. Delays were manageable with just one hour on the first leg out of Seattle. What I did not expect was for the flight attendants to be so curt and rude. When I was denied a blanket I could almost read the attendants mind (""please put me out of my misery""). Impolite doesn't even begin to describe their attitude."
2998,"A very frustrating experience. First their flight is delayed due to ""bad weather"" in LGA whereas we can see that United and all other airlines are taking off and the weather looked good enough. Initially they said it is delayed by an hour so we thought fine lets wait for an hour then they tell its delayed by another 2 hours. We had to catch a connecting flight at ORD which had just an hour layover. Then finally this flight from LGA is scheduled to take off 6 hours later than actual scheduled timings which means the connecting flight has already left. I called the customer care to check for the status and they tell that there are no more connecting flights from ORD to XNA for the day. The next connecting flight was only at 9.15am from ORD. So we decided to wait until 6.30am that day and leave directly from LGA instead of going to ORD and waiting till 9.15am. We (including my aged mother) finally landed up sleeping in the airport all night. The TSA officials were kind enough to give all passengers sleeping in the airport a cot and a bed sheet. Next day morning we start at 6.15AM and then again the flight is delayed by 2 hrs. One of the passengers asked the flight attendant if she will get her connecting flight and the attendant replies ""We just have to keep hopes. That is all we can do""!"
2999,I flew from IAH Airport to DFW as a layover and then DFW to ORD as the final destination on Saturday May 23rd. The flight leaving IAH was on time and arrived on time to DFW. However the flight from DFW was delayed by 45 minutes because the plane was coming in from Montego Bay Jamaica. So we had to wait and it took an additional hour to arrive at final destination.
3000,All four flights were terrible and the disorganization and poor customer service was inexcusable. We didn't experience anything like mixed up flights or delays that lasted too long but what we did experience was bad enough. We left for an international flight that departed at 6am they had such slow kiosk and desk service that almost an entire flight of people barely made it on the plane. Kiosks weren't working the people that worked there didn't even know what was going on and were flustered. The anxiety level was high because we all thought we might miss our flight due to American Airlines awful check in service. Instead of reassuring people that the flight wasn't going to leave without 75% of it's passengers. The wifi isn't free it doesn't work half the time and they boast 'free' things to watch and it's all a scam. For as much as they charge for a flight something as little as wifi can make a huge difference. We were on an international flight and they don't even offer snacks you have to buy snacks! I had a bad cold coming home and asked the flight attendant for some cold water and hot water and tea. She rolled her eyes at me and brought me hot water and cold water and no tea. I had to ask for tea from another flight attendant who practically threw it at me. I went to the bathroom during the flight and asked a flight attendant for tissues (again I had a bad cold) she was sitting down looking at her phone and didn't even look up at me just pointed at the bathroom. On the flight home there was a group of people that were obviously traveling together and were so disruptive and rude. They were standing up in the aisle talking loudly and there was a toddler with them that kept running up and down the aisle. The flight attendants never once controlled the situation even though all the other passengers were clearly annoyed and people were saying so out loud.
3001,Flew May 9 2015 from Boston to Paris. I am 75 yrs old and having lived both in South Africa and Europe have done a considerable amount of flying. This flight was absolutely the worst ever. Conditions regarding space and comfort (lack thereof) were beyond appalling. People who could not fit their feet under the seat in front of them were forced to stick them into the aisle. I feel that safety is compromised by these conditions and both the US Transportation Department and American Airlines need to seriously consider this issue. I will of course never fly with this airline again. In addition the food was not fit for consumption.
3002,I flew from Orlando to Barcelona on May 6th with a return on May 18th. It was by far one of my worst experiences in commercial flying. The reasoning for this rating is extensive and ranges from their computer changing my times and seats three times from reservation to flight to inoperative bathroom in flight to massive delays both ways ranging from almost 2 hours to cool down an aircraft cabin before boarding to waiting over 2 hours for flight attendants to arrive in Miami from Philadelphia. It is obvious that no longer is the passenger important but rather all the extra charges and cramped seating that rule the day. In terms of choosing an airline carrier it is sadly my opinion that airlines such as KLM or Lufthansa offer better service and would be my first choices on international flights.
3003,ORD-SAT on Apr 9 and RNO-ORD on Apr 23 both legs in First (due to upgrade) on an MD80. Both flights fine with slightly early arrivals and no drama - Obviously older planes showing some wear and tear but comfortable with standard First class seats. FA tending to First Class on the ORD-SAT leg was excellent hard working attentive continuously present in the cabin to tend to the passengers also a bit more formal (in a good way) less chatty (again good) and obviously concentrating on delivering a good service. FA on the second leg more relaxed in delivering service but still ok. Catering for the first (evening) leg was a chicken or pasta choice with the chicken dish bland and just barely edible. Not good enough even for economy on many other airlines. Also strange that AA considers the chicken or pasta choice a First Class offering on a three hour dinner time flight probably only possible on the US market. Wines served were ok and regular refills offered by the good FA. First Class breakfast RNO-ORD leg was cereal with no other option. Again how this can be considered a First Class breakfast for a four hour flight is beyond me. Good premium check-in with no significant lines and manned counters in both ORD and RNO boarding professional and painless. Actually two pleasant flights with good crews but also with sub- par catering. Also of course excellent value due to the upgrade.
3004,Flight 55 to Chicago due out Sunday morning at 9.30. Sat in airport all day to find out at around 3pm that the flight had been cancelled due to a technical issue. No information from the staff all day. Had to find out what was going on via the website. The flight got rescheduled for Monday. After another hour delay we finally boarded the same aircraft that they where having issues with the previous day. We set off to the runway only to turn back with a technical issue. We were then sat onboard the aircraft for a further 6 hours as they where having the same issues as the previous day. After the 6 hours we where informed that the flight was being cancelled yet again. By this time it was to late to make alternative arrangements. The downfall for me was the job I should have been at on Monday morning had to be cancelled as I could only get there by Wednesday. Total disgrace.
3005,I had a flight from Chicago to London Heathrow. Flight 46 on 14th May. A Boeing 767-300. Delayed by 2 hours so missed my British Airways connection. Cabin was dull. Worst part no personal screen and seats short on legroom. Felt like all economy passengers were refugees running to some other place. Food was ok but not as good as compared to Air India. Staff were ok too. Will never recommend AA.
3006,After a 24 hour delay during which time we were not kept informed of what was happening we board another plane. The new plane sits on the tarmac 45 minutes past take off time and only then the pilot informs us there appears to be a problem with the plane so the plane returns to the gate. There are no apologies there is no information and it seems total indifference to people like myself who will miss their connection resulting in a further 8 hour delay. Service is zero professionalism is zero however the aircrew do appear to be putting in a lot of effort to avoid passing among the passengers or making eye contact. Flight 9268 to Chicago.
3007,I flew Baltimore to Seoul (BWI-DFW-ICN) on 10 May 2015 the flight out of Baltimore had to return to the gate due a cockpit display not working making the flight an hour late on take off. We were then diverted due to weather - admittedly the crew were helpful during our enforced 4 hour plane-bound ground stop in Austin. We finally got to Dallas 5 hours late – ‘to be greeted by a (non-existent) customer representative’ the queue for the customer service at C25 was pathetic – two people and a queue of several hundred snaking around the terminal. Fortunately I had my BA executive card and got into the Admirals lounge were the queue was only about 20 people. We (three of us) were rebooked on the flight to Narita (Japan) and onto Seoul the following day. Although technically that flight would have left technical ‘issues’ meant that we left 7.5 hours late arriving in Narita at about 11pm. What a contrast - upon arrival there were about 15 Japanese customer service people with individual ‘packages’ for passengers containing onward boarding passes details of buses to pre-arranged hotel accommodation and a food box. Next day a special bus took us back to the airport for our onward flight to Seoul. Our luggage was not so lucky – even with the 7 hour delay at Dallas AA was unable to send our luggage out for another 2 days! The return flight was ‘better’ – in that there wasn't a delay but the flight was cramped – the 777 clearly had not been ‘spring cleaned’ since its delivery many many years ago the food was mediocre at best and the ‘entertainment system’ simply because it was entertaining trying to find anything of interest to watch/listen to. Quite simply AA (as do other US carriers) provided the absolute bare minimum. Unfortunately it is ‘company policy’ to only fly American carriers – and probably the only reason that American carriers still exist.
3008,Flight 2256 to depart IAH at 6pm on 5/12/15 was delayed by one hour. Myself and 2 daughters were on our way to Branson MO for a short vacation with family. This delay made it impossible to connect to our flight at DFW so we had to reschedule our flights to the next day cutting into our planned time with family. I have not flown AA in years due to lost luggage issues previously and this is my experience the first time I tried to use them again. Not only was this a huge hassle with 2 kids to get to and thru the airport (then out again and back the next day) but I'm very disappointed in the fact that our vacation is having to be cut into as a result of the flight delay. Extremely disappointed.
3009,AA138 DFW-DCA first class. I've really stopped expecting anything when flying domestically in the US or Canada. Flight departed late due to heavy traffic and weather. Seat ok but nothing special on a 737-800. Was in 1A. Having just got off QR from Doha a big change. Cabin crew not friendly Basically had my meal tossed at me. Meal itself was tasteless and over cooked. No control over economy class passengers using first class lavatory even while the seatbelt sign was on. It is getting me home which is about all I can say that is positive about this flight.
3010,It is not a good feeling when you get ashamed of the company that is representing your country to the world. But it was how I felt when I boarded AA 91 from London to Chicago. The oldest plane ever out of 4 overhead TV (they didn't even fold-this ancient) 2 didn't work. How can you still not have an in seat entertainment on an 8 hours international flight? Noise level in the cabin was at times unbearable. It was the last leg of our round-trip to Greece. First 3 legs were served by British Airways - what a dramatic difference.
3011,AA2320 - May 7 2015. Inaugural 787 flight on AA - DFW to ORD. Fun flight - a lot of press at the boarding area. Photos were taken of each passenger standing in front of a green screen so that you would get a picture printed with you in front of the plane. 82 people on the upgrade list for a completely full flight - most I've ever seen. Boarding was smooth - about 90% of the passengers were airline/aviation enthusiasts that purposely were on the flight. Flight attendants/pilots were all jovial and happy to show off the new plane. Water-cannon send-off from Terminal D - then a nice smooth take-off with cheers from passengers. Good inflight entertainment - but still they show the same shows that were on flights I took 9 months ago. Why can't American keep updated entertainment? Emirates/Singapore/Qantas/British all do it. Drink and BOB on board - people walking all over the plane between First and Coach taking pictures. Camera-men filming the cabins and passengers reactions. Landed early at ORD and quick disembarkation. Overall a good flight and cheap fare.
3012,"Just returned from a two week trip to China using AA into Beijing returning from Shanghai. We've traveled to over 70 countries world wide and this was the first and last time we'll ever use American Airlines. They use a 777-200 out of Chicago which resembles a cattle car the way passengers are packed into the economy section. 2-5-2 configuration and while we paid extra to sit in the two side the seats were so cramped there wasn't enough room between rows to put the tray table down for meals. When the passengers in front reclined their seats it was claustrophobic. Keep in mind this is a 14 hour flight. Ironically enough the flight attendants who refer to this equipment as the Slave Ship told us AA is talking about adding another row of seats. Meals were horrid power port and audio jacks didn't work and the ""entertainment"" system is laughable. We had three flights in China on China Eastern Airlines while we were there and their aircraft were all modern clean and spacious. If this is what we can expect from the American/US Airways merger I will avoid the new company at all costs."
3013,This was the worst travelling experience! The staff are rude and abrupt at check-in the meals are terrible and you cannot purchase anything else on board they didn't have earphones or the option to purchase on board (for a long haul flight from Philadelphia to Dublin) and none of the reading lights worked in our row. Aside from this the planes are extremely old to the point where it was genuinely terrifying. The insulation is extremely thin in comparison to other planes so you can hear every noise the engine makes! Also the navigation system didn't work as we were landing but the pilot told us not to worry he knew Dublin so he could find the airport!
3014,I just traveled with my mother to Miami Florida from Calgary Alberta in April we bought our tickets online a month before our trip. We received the flight information by email everything was going fine. The flight down to Miami was great however the return trip was a different story again we checked-in the night before to save time but they overbooked the flight from Dallas to Phoenix and my elderly mother had to pay an extra 35 dollars to be guaranteed a seat on the flight to be able to stay traveling with me. I was asked to check in my carry on in Dallas because they were not going to have enough space in the overhead compartments. When we arrived in Phoenix they announced that the flight was overbooked and asked if anyone was interested in staying overnight and catch the morning flight to Calgary they offered to pay for the hotel and give you a travel voucher I could not take them up on the offer as I had already checked my carry on in Dallas. We bought our tickets a month before I felt that our seats should be guaranteed. The only saving grace of the trip was that the stewards were very nice on the flights.
3015,"As two couples we traveled Heathrow to Palm Springs via Dallas Fort Worth. The Heathrow flight was on time and the service was ok but not great. A little too ""matter of fact"" if I can use that term. Our flight from DFW was a different affair. Because we couldn't book our seats we were advised to ask at the desk at Dallas. When we arrived I was impressed that they knew we were coming but added"" we think we have four seats spare but leave it with us"". I had already had trouble booking seats from Heathrow with not wanting to pay and extra £30 pre booking fee! We eventually did get 4 seats. 2 at the front and two at the back. The attendants were efficient although abrupt. On our return flight again we couldn't book the seats we wanted and got split up yet again on DFW to Heathrow leg. The Staff were quite rude to all passengers. One fellow passenger asked what choice was for breakfast? ""Only one option"" was the reply ""take it or leave it""! We got the impression that they didn't really want to be there. Many reading lights and video screens were not working just what you need on an overnight transatlantic trip! We bought our tickets in September 2014 and we couldn't get seats together when it came to the 24 hr check-in. So what gives. I will say this now; we wont fly AA again and I will not recommend them either. They are advertising ""We are Adding new planes every week"" I think they should repair some of their existing ones first!"
3016,Very happy to write a quick follow up to my recent review indicating that my good experience was not a fluke. LA- Kona first class on a 757. I was served a decent meal by an extremely pleasant crew including the signature sundae. Everything was crisp and professional with a touch of warm. Same comments about sad entertainment system though.
3017,Just travelled Heathrow - JFK and back in economy. Really happy with the service the stewards were very helpful even giving us info on the best places to eat in New York. The flight was half empty so we could spread out on both flights. It was on time. Food ok and they make sure we had a drink in our hand whenever we wanted. Very comprehensive choice of old and new films/TV. Would recommend.
3018,I am quite happy to write a positive review of my experience yesterday. Flying from Honolulu to LA on a 757 I was expecting very little. Instead I was welcomed by a warm crew to a comfortable seat and received warm attentive service. The breakfast was quite nice and beverages were free flowing and offered in a friendly manner. The entertainment on a screen ahead was minimal and that was the only second rate part of the trip. The pillow and blanket offered were large and comfy. I hope this signals an upgrade system-wide for a product that has long called for one.
3019,"Will not be flying with this airline again. Was traveling from Seattle to Houston Hobby through DFW. Plane was delayed on the runway for over an hour because American couldn't communicate with their own computer system in Dallas. Because of the delay we landed in DFW just 20 minutes before my connecting flight was scheduled to leave in another terminal. Hauled over to that terminal only to see a completely different flight posted at my gate with no agents in site. Found another gate with an agent and told him my situation. He put me on standby for another flight to Houston. I was called from the standby list and put on that flight they asked me to gate check my bag. Then after I was seated they called me off the airplane saying they had double booked my seat! They could not return my bag to me. Put me on yet another flight to Houston for two hours later. But that gate listed information for another flight. Talking with other customers it became clear that none of the gates displayed the appropriate flights it was utter chaos with agents switching gates for flights every 15 minutes or so and disgruntled passengers everywhere. Meanwhile it turns out that the flight they kicked me off of was cancelled because the pilot had reached his maximum number of hours before the flight ever left. Everyone on that flight was moved to my new flight. Eventually they boarded the flight and then sat at the gate for an hour because as the captain put it ""someone who needs to be on the flight is not on it."" The passenger sitting next to me showed me radar on her phone indicating that a storm was rolling in that would prevent us from leaving if we didn't leave soon. Many passengers started shouting to the crew asking why we hadn't left yet and many openly started wondering if the crew was actually making excuses to delay the flight until it was cancelled. Remember that many of these passengers had been on a cancelled flight just a few hours before. Anyway the captain did wait long enough that a storm rolled in as predicted. We were told we would need to fly out of the other side of the airport and circle around the storm so we taxied over. Once we were all the way on the other end we were told the new route required more fuel than we had so we had to return to the gate. Then we were told the ramp was closed so there was no gate for us to refuel at so we had to just wait. Finally a gate opened up for us but we just sat there for another hour. Then the captain told us that he reached his maximum number of flying hours so the flight was cancelled. At this point I cut my losses rented a car and drove to Houston from Dallas."
3020,This review is being written after a number of times flying with American Airlines. You can almost always expect delays terrible customer service and just an overall bad experience. We had a two hour delay from MIA to SFO which would connect to LAX. The airline representatives were not helpful and made our travel anxiety even worse. Absolutely the worst airline across the board-from aircraft to personnel. How could the customer service be so terrible? The only reason I chose this airline was because it was cheaper than JetBlue. American Airlines is truly a disappointment.
3021,A321 TPA-IA 737 MIA-YYZ. First leg delayed by over 1.5 hrs. Missed connection by 12 minutes. No apologies and stupid explanations. Put us on flight over 5 hours later. Once boarded we sat over an hour waiting for a pilot! Two different stories. Pilot delayed in traffic or pilot was timed out for his duty day and had to find someone else to drive the 737. And of course they lost our luggage. Is this any way for a major airline to operate?
3022,We had two flights with AA from Madrid to Miami with their 777. The first flight was five hours late no excuse no money. The B777 is one of the worst you can fly with - 2-5-2 seating but AA charges 100 Euro extra for the 2 seats-row. The seating is horrible no space in economy the in-flight entertainment is like 2002 with a small amount of films on re-run every 15 or 30 minutes (by the way my LCD did not work). The worst about AA is the staff - unfriendly tired and virtually throwing the trash food on your seat. Even for a US-carrier AA is under all poor standards. So - stay away. American is like Ryanair but not as cheap. Never again!
3023,DCA-DFW-SEA-DFW-IAD B737-800 Coach Class for all four segments 04/17 and 04/21. PROS: First Class check-in due to my One World Emerald Tier status; Flights on time except for DFW-SEA that left the gate on time but returned due to a mechanical problem that resulted in a delayed departure of an hour and arrival in SEA 40 minutes late. All planes clean and either new or fairly new. Staff efficient and most were quite friendly except for one on the SEA-DFW segment who had an attitude problem. Snacks for sale on three of the four segments and complimentary beverages served on all segments seats comfortable except for DCA-DFW (see CONS). Baggage transferred efficiently and delivered on the carousels at SEA and IAD very quickly as they had One World priority tags. CONS: The Admiral's Club Lounges look nice with comfortable seats but the free snack offerings at DFW were pitiful DCA-DFW had a brand new plane with the new B737 sky interior and AA leather seats. This was outstanding though sadly ruined by two awful boxes for the seat back video screens anchored on both sides of the middle seat foot well. This was pathetic for legroom on even a three-hour flight; Any airline that can find a very compact version of this video control box is a winner! Overall despite the many negative reviews that I have read recently about AA I was very satisfied with this trip and will definitely use them again. I didn't have high expectations for domestic AA service upon arrival at DCA on 04/17 but they actually did much better on the entire round-trip.
3024,R/T SFO-JFK. Outbound in business return in F. I think AA is doing a very good job with its Airbus 321 transcons in the premium classes. The seats are excellent both in C and in F. Indeed both are horiz lie flats. IFE is superb. Lots of choices large HD screens and Bose noise cancelling headphones supplied. Service was good in both directions. The food was a 7 on a scale of 10. My main criticism was the lunch in F. It unfortunately conveyed a sense of cut backs. Lounges at both ends were top notch particularly the F lounge at JFK. That is not to say that SFO Admirals was bad. It is truly excellent just that the F lounge is better. Overall on these transcons AA has a quality product.
3025,"Wife and I booked a trip from Houston to see the son in West Palm Beach on 4/17/2015. Our flight was supposed to be one of the first that left that day so we were ate the airport very early. Check in was 4 am. Of all the flights in the entire airport ours was delayed 2 hours. Why? Because they said it did not get in till late the previous day. Well that delay messed up our connecting flight in Dallas-Fort Worth so the day got worse and our total day was extended 6-7 hours. I understand that there are times when issues cannot be avoided but the airline booking personnel just didn't seem to care. We paid extra for the priority seating but they just threw us in the pool of last place seating until we got in their face. They did give us a meal voucher good for one of the vendors in the airport but only when we had to demand it. The pilot explained that there are rules of mandatory rest between flights which we understand but that news was known the previous day so why did we not get notified? The connecting flight was also delayed due to maintenance of passenger seats. For our return flight home my wife and I were praying for no issues but American Airlines made sure that we would not go home happy. The flight from West Palm Beach to Dallas-Fort Worth was pretty routine in the air but flight was delayed leaving the airport due to some ""auxiliary power"" issue that maintenance had to remedy before take off. When we arrived in Dallas-Fort Worth the powered boarding shute needed maintenance's attention before we could exit the plane into the terminal so we had to wait for that fix. As luck would have it our connecting flight was delayed another 1.5 hours! I will definitely find another airline before I choose this one again. The money you save does not justify the agony or grief this airline dishes out."
3026,I was scheduled to fly from DFW to HOU Flight 5770 departing DFW 3.10pm arriving in HOU. Instead they notified us that there was no plane. We didn't have a plane to board until 5.30pm and the plane didn't depart until 6.20pm that evening. Over a 3 hour delay due to not having an available plane. Before we took off the pilot notified us that due to weather they were going to have to take a more Western route and were not sure if they were going to have enough fuel. Instead of actually getting more fuel we took off anyway. 30 min into the flight they notified us that there was a line to land into HOU due to weather and that they didn't have enough fuel and needed to land in San Antonio. Not only did we not get into SA until 8pm but the crew notified us that they had flown too many hours. So even if we did get more fuel there was no crew to fly the plane. At this point we were stranded in San Antonio and the weather had become so bad in Houston there were no planes out. We were stranded. After 2 hrs waiting in line the representative informed me I could not get back to Hobby until 7.30pm Monday. Monday I flew back to DFW 1433 to catch another plane 1489 to get to IAH by 12 noon. I took a cab from IAH to Hobby where my car was at b/c this was a better option than waiting all day to get back home. Practically over 24 hours to fly from DFW to HOU. I am extremely dissatisfied with American that I will no longer be flying this airline. Even though American did supply meal vouchers and put us in a hotel this is completely unacceptable.
3027,I know American is now responsible for US Air so I will put my comments here. I had a 4 leg trip from Houston to Ashville through Charlotte. Tickets were cheaper flying out of Bush but I will go through Hobby next time. Every leg of trip was delayed crowded or a rough ride. Seats were cramped. Snacks were to expensive. I checked my small bag to avoid the storage bin struggle. Our gate at Charlotte was doubled up for two flights from two major airports the information on screens was not updated with delays and confusing. I will pay more and fly another airline or drive before I fly American (US Air).
3028,My family and I were traveling on March 27 on flight AA 238 from (DCA) Washington Ronald Reagan National D.C. at 5.35 pm to (MIA) Miami International Airport. The airplane was old. We could see where the paint was chipped on the right wing. We had seats 15D 15E and 15F. The seat next to the window would not move back up after it was inclined back. We were landing and we pressed the button and could not get the seat to move back in an upright position. A male flight attention called my attention and I said I could not move it. He said that seats on American were more aesthetic than they are functional. The airplane lacked tray tables. Accordingly when served drinks there was no place to put the drinks. Furthermore not only were tray tables absent from this old plane but even the lock to hold them in place was gone from the plane. The plane had not been properly cleaned before the flight and our flight was overbooked. The seats were very narrow even though we paid for more better seats. My mother who is of normal weight and body proportions had difficulty getting in and out of it. Our earlier trip to Washington DC from Miami was on a newer plane and we didn't have these problems.
3029,8th April AA57. Return on AA56. This was our first and last trip with AA. We were told we would be flying on the new AA planes. This simply was not true. Why should one pay the same price if you are going to fly on a dirty broken old plane in business with a ridiculous 2 3 2 seating arrangement and the entertainment system broken. We will never fly AA again. They seriously need to up their game to compete with Emirates Singapore etc.
3030,"This is a rough review because we flew first business and coach. We usually fly coach but for a trip to Napa we used our points to go first class. The AA/United merger combined the worst two airlines in the Western world. Flew on 4/7 (260 / 193) - BAN-DFX-SAN. Service food seating excellent. Plane a little old and shaky but all in all a good flight. Returned 4/13 (193/5290) SAN-Charlotte-BNA. Although we had first class we were relegated to business with an accompanying drop in quality across the board. The trouble is the age of the planes - it's like something from a museum. The noise from the engine was so loud it was like sticking your head under the hood of a car. But for once all flights left on time without mechanical problems. We were closer to the real world of 95% of all travelers with tasteless food (a box handed out at the end of a 6 hour flight with a roll candy bar and smoothy). Entertainment (quote unquote) was from attached dirty ancient screens for which AA would kindly sell earphones. I had my IPAD and kept busy while the Mrs tried to doze. Then at Charlotte it's Reality Time. We got bumped to economy (first row) but the constant groans reminded us that these ""seats"" were once used for unruly reform school students. That was in the 1940's since they were tiny dirty torn and stretched. The place looked filthy. A webbed shower curtain in several pieces separated ""first class"" (real classy) but they did manage to pass drinks to us in the cattle car. Yes we are switching carriers to anyone who has bought a plane in the last 30 years."
3031,AA flight 2891 on 19th Apr 2015. Flight was late 140 mins due to which I was sure to miss my next connection to Calgary. Technical faults do occur and are understandable. But the issue is how rude and uncooperative the staff were. They had a permanent no for an answer for everything in a most unprofessional way. As a last resort I was booked on same day from San Francisco to Calgary as it was very important for me to be there in Calgary. I had to rush and take ground transportation from Sacramento to San Francisco and working out the next step as I was moving ahead. Forget help no guidance was provided on how I can get to SF airport. Would have accepted same sequence of events if they were delivered to me with a smile. AA staff needs serious training in this aspect of customer service.
3032,AA 954 on 12th April 2015. Truly awful service from Buenos Aires to NYC. Flight staff were alternately incompetent angry or non-existent. Bizarre lack of professionalism creates a stressful flight atmosphere. With so many international options never again will we fly American. Not worth the few dollars saved on the ticket price.
3033,"On April 9 2015 while my wife and I waited to board a flight from Barcelona to NY-JFK there was an announcement that it had been canceled. It was hard to hear and broadcast only once. Several of us had to confirm with an attendant that it was indeed canceled that we had to pick up our luggage at the baggage area and return to the check-in counter. My wife and I along with the others scrambled to navigate our way through the airport area finally to the baggage area. After what seemed like a very long wait our luggage along with a handful of others' came out last. This meant that when we finally found our way back to the AA check-in area we were at the end of an extremely long line. Eventually my wife and I ""split"" with her waiting on a long line at an AA service counter. After about 3 hours she made it to the front while I still had many people ahead of me. AA booked us on Iberia flights for the following day and a hotel with paid meals. We were then given directions to a free hotel shuttle. We never found it and ended up paying for a taxi but the driver took us to the ""wrong"" airport hotel. Fortunately that hotel let us take their shuttle to the ""right"" hotel. It's surprising but almost understandable that AA had no ""backup airplane"". My complaint is less about the cancellation and more about the lack of assistance at Barcelona Airport. Announcements and guidance was poor. There was no one to help us navigate back to the baggage area. We had to wait on a customs line to get back ""in"" so that we could go to the baggage area. We and others had to grab AA personnel passing by to find out anything even in the baggage area. It was an upsetting experience that cost us a day. We will think twice before using AA again & have spread the word wherever we can."
3034,LHR-RDU economy. I was really impressed with this flight. Ok the plane was the same age as me (28 I checked) and showed it - particularly in not having PTVs for quite a long flight. Seats a little hard. Everything else was very impressive though - food was edible and generous (main meal Ice cream and second snack meal) and regular drinks runs including beer. Staff were incredibly polite and friendly and there was a very relaxed atmosphere which I liked.
3035,My husband and our teenage son went to visit family in Nashville for two weeks this Easter. We booked our four flights each London-Chicago-Nashville and back through BA. BA were supposed to take us as far as Chicago with American Airlines doing the Chicago to Nashville bit. We missed our connection at both legs of the journey which was hugely inconvenient particularly when returning to the UK. To be fair AA brought us back to Chicago airport in time but for some reason the they were not given a gate for more than an hour. I approached the flight attendant asking whether AA can communicate with BA about this delay particularly as there were several people apart from us who were due to catch the same flight. She said that the flight will probably wait for us they know that we are being delayed. This resulted in a mad run between terminals 3 and 5 in vain. We were then sent back to AA desk in Terminal 3 to rebook our tickets for another flight. AA staff took a very long time to process each person. By the time we finished it was more than 1.5 hrs after we started queuing. We were told that the we will be put on AA flight to London tomorrow afternoon. There are many flights between London and Chicago and we requested an earlier flight. The person dealing with us said that if we wanted tickets to an earlier flight we should have come earlier. She refused to check whether BA had any flights the next day. In fact they were as unhelpful as possible. I made a point that we paid tickets for the flight that just left and had we managed to be on it we would not be asking for anything. We were told that we cannot collect our luggage as 'it has gone to BA'. We were given vouchers for an airport hotel and forced to stay overnight without luggage and they reluctantly gave us two sets of very basic things such as toothbrush and toothpaste for us three. The next day at AA check in desk we were told we need to collect our luggage at luggage collection No 5 after which we needed to bring it back upstairs and check them in. They could not locate our luggage. As the time for our next flight was approaching my husband ran to the check in desk to let them know that our luggage never materialised whilst I waited at carrousel No 5 in case it does. We asked if we could be upgraded if there were any spare seats in the premier class and the staff member said 'we do not upgrade for such a reason'. No other option would make me use this airline again.
3036,"Non-existent customer service. Recently flew JAN-DFW-ELP. Delayed and missed connection in DFW due to weather. Had to overnight. No help whatsoever from AA because of ""weather"". No vouchers no distressed travel rates no phone number to call for booking my own hotel and had to walk 20 gates for hilariously cheap toiletries kit that was given grudgingly. Surly agents throughout. Truly an example of the worst in airline culture. To top it all off was unable to be booked on next morning flight and missed work. Agent could only put me on a later flight. Said I was put on FC upgrade list however. The next day when I was told I was upgraded they wanted $70 for the 1 hr flight. Agent said ""well it's not free"". I am AAdvantage Gold which is meaningless. Now a hostage to them with my new location but will take United or Southwest whenever possible in the future. People understand weather issues but the total lack of even the most basic customer service and rude behavior/attitudes is appalling about this ""airline"". Previously flown with Delta extensively and they always handled weather delays and misconnections in ATL professionally and courteously. So it can be done AA just doesn't care."
3037,Original flight was scheduled to depart at 10.30 am from DFW. Flight delayed too many times to count. Right now we are at 4 hours past (2.30 pm) I am on the plane have been sitting here with no air flow or electricity for about an hour. We were told that the flight crew was coming from OK however all the passengers from OK are on board and the flight attendants said they could not find pilots. This type of incompetence and lack of communication does not instil a lot of confidence in my safe arrival at my final destination. Although AA was $100 cheaper than United I will never fly with AA again.
3038,Flew American three times in the past two weeks. All domestic. 1) San Francisco to O'Hare Chicago. 2) LaGuardia NYC to O'Hare Chicago. 3) O'Hare Chicago to San Francisco. Good: on time performance. Did not experience delays Bad: 25$ for a checked luggage? Come on! What are you? A Low Cost Carrier? And because of this many people opted for a carryon resulting in overcrowding of overhead bins. There were simply not enough space for all carry-ons. Bad: flight attendants! No smiles! Not very attentive. They looked tired grumpy and stressed! Bad: IFE! No individual screens. Bad: old single aisle Boeing planes. Bad: you have to pay for everything. Complimentary drinks limited to water canned sodas and juices.
3039,LHR-DFW return on 777-300ER. I booked this route especially to take this newer plane for the inflight entertainment which did not disappoint. I found the crew okay and some even smiled! What I disliked about AA was the exorbitant prices they charge for pre-allocated seats which was a necessity in order to seat a family of 4 together. The food was mostly below average but having read reviews I wasn't surprised. I don't like the way they have chosen to add another seat to each row in economy. So instead of 9 abreast they have made it 10. This makes the aisle ridiculously narrow and I don't see how hundreds of people would be able to escape in an emergency so I'm surprised the FAA permits this higher density seating. Legroom was tight for anyone of above average height. I also found it strange how the seat belt sign was illuminated for virtually the whole flight - in both directions - and there are hardly any announcements from the flight deck even when turbulence is quite choppy. I chose AA for the equipment they use on this route but I would think twice about booking them again due to the hidden costs that aren't factored into the ticket price.
3040,I have just flown American from London to Miami with a connection to Cancun. The flight AA 57 due to leave at 9.45 am from London was delayed by 1hr 35 minutes with no apology or explanation as to why. The delay coupled with a customs shambles in Miami meant we missed our connection. The Express tickets (red ones) were a complete waste of time we just joined the queue with everybody else and the lady at the next baggage check in was totally disinterested and dismissive. I am frequent flyer an this was booked via BA and was a very poor customer experience. I will avoid American at all costs in future.
3041,LHR-MIA March/April. We were sold this round trip on the 'new' AA Business Class product. We knew it was a 777-300ER LHR-MIA and a 777-300 back. The outbound was fantastic with great service seats AVOD and everything one should expect from a modern BC cabin. we have flown Emirates BC 4 times in the past 6 months and this cabin is comparable to both the A380 and the 777 in that class defining airline. Whilst we found the service in Emirates a bit disorganised AA was efficient friendly and warm we like the more mature no nonsense crew on Airlines out of the States although it's a thin line to rude and dis-interested on occasions! However AA should be ashamed scheduling a 200 version for the return leg which was not a result of a last minute 'change out' due to failure but that quote ' The newer plane has been stolen for Los Angeles some weeks ago'. Call me sad but I would have changed my flight if I'd known we'd be on this antique! Lie at an angle beds a 10 inch screen maybe 11 low def (love the jumpy fuzzy effects reminded me of the 90s) and the general feel of a very tired plane! What was different was the excellent service and food I was annoyed when I sat down but slept for 3 hours and was relaxed when I got off. AA has begun to catch up it's got some way to go and given the lounge experience (don't ever ever call sparkling wine Champagne!) there is a way to go the crew are spot on and at the end of the day that's what makes a flight. Seat score is for the 777-300ER but oddly it's not great for couples as these seats are very. 'Pod' like and chatting to each other isn't easy AVOD score is the new plane.
3042,Flew Boston to Barbados via Miami March 10 returning March 17. Managed to buy a cheap upgrade to First Class Boston to Miami which was good - though American airlines first class doesn't measure up to the first class of other airlines. One good flight out of four. The rest was economy all the way and truly miserable. Miserly leg room have to pay extra for everything ground staff ranged from hostile to comatose cabin crew completely indifferent. Was made to feel like a dollar bill squeezed till I squeaked. AA operates for its shareholders not its passengers.
3043,Flew from San Francisco to DFW (Dallas) for my connection into Houston Hobby (04/05/15) just to sit around for hours the airline changed the departure time at least 7 times then in the end it was cancelled and do you think they had the decency to have a ticket agent at the booth no mysteriously the agents all disappeared right before the cancelled notice went up on their board. No one instructed us to do anything I went to other agents and they just told us they could not help. Just ridiculous all around meanwhile Mother's and children traveling alone sitting at the gate crying trying to figure out how they were going to get home. I ended up having to get a rental to make it to my final destination on my own. All American Airlines does is inconvenience people the final straw was when the agents at the rental car counter stated that American does this every week to folks who are going to Houston Austin and Lufkin so it was nothing new to them they claim mechanical failure! If they supposedly have new planes and they are investing in all this new equipment where is it? Why don't they use some of those new so called planes they have purchased! This was a less than an hour flight come on American have some common sense!
3044,From LAX to PVG (Shanghai) the worst business class. Most of the flights to Asia have much better business seating. The middle row has three seats if you are in the middle of the middle row you must cross someone to get in and out. The seats configuration is old and looks very dark and unpleasant. Larger screen for movies but not very many good selections.
3045,AA are making a big thing about all the new planes they are buying. I flew from Heathrow to JFK 27th March on a really smart 777. That's where the complements end though. I have never flown with a worse cabin crew. They all wore different clothing as though they had turned up from home and not bothered to change. They were totally uncommunicative - amazingly not a word was spoken to us through the entire journey. One of the crew fell asleep in a seat at the back of the cabin. Food was served as though they were doing us a favour and just dropped in front of us without a word there was not a friendly smile between them. One of the crew was not tall enough to close the overhead lockers. I cannot believe AA are spending so much on renewing their fleet yet seem totally unconcerned that their staff are behaving in this way. I flew back on BA - a fabulous crew who worked their socks off for the customers what a contrast!
3046,AA flight 397 on March 25th. The first leg of our trip was delayed so we arrived at the gate 7 minutes before the flight was to take off. We had notified the gate agents that we were on the way to the flight but they shut the door in our face and would not let us board. We found out they had overbooked the flight by 50 seats. On the next flight we watched as friends of the gate agents boarded on standby while the rest of us were bumped > again. No gate agents seemed interested in helping us get home. We eventually had to rent a car and drive home since American Airlines would not give us a seat on any flight to get home. An extra $100 and 10 hours delayed we arrived home.
3047,LHR to MIA Business Class. The plane was one of the older 777-200 with 2-3-2 seating meaning that the person in the middle always had to disturb someone to get out. The seat was ok but not really a true flat bed. The VOD was patchy in that on two of the films I watched there was something wrong with the display so I had to stop it and restart it. The food was very nice - my steak was delicious. Cabin crew were all very friendly and accommodating.
3048,Travelled with AA February 2015 LHR-MIA return flight out older plane - adequate for a day flight. Thankfully new plane with fully lie flat bed. On return excellent service from cabin staff food also beyond expectations.
3049,I flew Manchester to JFK and return with AA. On arrival at Manchester the airline staff quizzed us in detail about where else we usually travelled to why we were going to the States what jobs we did. This took about 10 minutes. Check in was via a machine designed to make AA a staff saving however it did nothing for their customers most of whom were frustrated at its inability to work. The whole crew were late and ran through the airport together to take up their posts. Did this account for them not checking whether the passengers had on their seat belts or arm rests in the correct position? Apparently not as it was exactly the same on the return flight. The safety video could not be viewed by passengers seated by the window due to the low overhead and central hanging videos. Did the crew have a uniform? They all dressed differently some wore extensive amounts of jewellery and chewed gum others had not even combed or tidied their hair. All were markedly scruffy compared to every other airline I have ever flown with. More worrying was that none of the crew advised passengers to remain seated when the seat belt light was lit and passengers proceeded to walk around the cabin throughout the flight. Or maybe it was the Captain's error in not turning the light off at all. Who knows whether we even had a Captain as on the out flight no announcements were even made! Not impressive on safety at all. Lets face it food comfort etc are also important but if an airline fails on basic safety the rest pales to insignificance.
3050,I have the time to write this review due to the third delay I've had with this airline. Not a single good thing I can say about my experience with American. I have flown Southwest Delta Jetblue Frontier and this is by far the worst airline I have flown. We had an hour and a half delay the first flight plus an emergency situation so we missed our connecting flight which has never happened to me. They supplied us with the worst hotel overnight. It wasn't just us that missed our flight 5 other families on separate ones missed theirs too. Then the flight the next day got delayed 30 minutes! So our three day trip turned into one day from all the delays and missed flights. Finally heading home and they announce mechanical problems with the plane. So now the flight is delayed 2 hours and we are missing our connecting flight to Salt Lake. So we get to board on a 6 pm flight but let's not kid ourselves that'll be delayed too so probably 7. And then it's a 4.5 hour flight so I'll be getting home at 2am. Other airlines can figure it out so please do to and spare us all the pain and frustration.
3051,"Due to a booking snafu (which may have been of my making) and the flight being oversold our non-stop return flight LHR-RDU was unavailable. The courteous and helpful ticket desk staff re-booked our free ticket LHR-JFK-RDU. We were told with great pride that the transatlantic portion would be aboard AA's new flagship 777-300ER. I applaud AA as being the only U.S. airline to give it's customers the opportunity to ride the latest and finest of American ingenuity technology and manufacturing excellence. It did strike me however that AA may have commissioned a ""lite"" version of the plane as it was missing some of the bells and whistles I had seen on some foreign carriers (wood floors mood lighting etc). Overall the economy interior can best be described as bland. On the plus side mammoth overhead bins decent seats great ride and as good an in flight entertainment system as you'll find anywhere in coach. Watched three excellent first run movies. All we need now is some edible food and AA will have caught up with BA and VS. However as a word of caution to those flying from the US to the UK on AA be aware of the aircraft type when you make your booking. In addition to the new AA Flagship 777-300 the airline also flies the 777-200 which is getting along in age the venerable 767-300 and the 757-200 which in my opinion is not at all suited to Transatlantic travel."
3052,New York (JFK) to Antigua during the very bad snow on the US East Coast. Early morning departure was going well until we reached the gate and found that a problem with a burst pipe meant no baggage could be loaded. However assume this was a knock on from the weather conditions. We were kept relatively well informed about delay which extended to around 3 hrs. However the anticipation of arriving in 85 degrees warmth mitigated the delay. Service on aircraft was fine. We had seats with extra leg room. Inflight entertainment ok. Only soft drinks were free. We had an egg sandwich which was OK. Flight back was also delayed slightly but made up time to arrive near to scheduled time. No queue at immigration. However all this came to nought due to baggage problem at aircraft which meant we waited an hour for bags to arrive. No complaints about flight crew either way - clearly not as customer focused as Non US airlines but efficient.
3053,Flew RDU-LHR on a free economy ticket. I prefer other airlines but the RDU-LHR non-stop convenience trumps all. It also gives me the opportunity to judge the progress of the AA/USAir merger. On the downside the venerable 767-300 is one year older (27 years and counting) still has the mail slot overhead storage bins the ancient hanging screen entertainment and the excruciatingly uncomfortable seats. I did notice that this old warhorse had been updated with blended winglets to save money which I'm certain they pass along to those paying for tickets. On board the hot breakfast croissant has been replaced with a box of sugar laden treats and the dinner has regressed from merely uninteresting to inedible. The flight attendants are excellent given what they have to work with - even giving up their crew rest seats to accommodate the spring breakers who made this a 100% full flight. On the plus side a current movie that I had considered paying to see (Whiplash) swift check-in and 45 minutes early into LHR. AA doesn't seem challenged to upgrade their transatlantic game but unless you're flying from RDU there must be a better option to get from the U.S. to the UK.
3054,Flew JFK to Manchester. First disaster came when checking in for flight to be told as a group of 6 we couldn't be seated together. Then it got worse as we couldn't be sat as couples unless we paid $260.00 per couple. Once on board we were sat apart. The cabin crew were at best unkempt and rude. The meal we were served was awful. Only 1 toilet was working for the full economy cabin on a 757 this is not good on a 6 hour flight. Overall a disappointing experience and will not fly on American again.
3055,AA 280 ICN to DFW. Was flying with an economy ticket got an upgrade to business kind of last minute. Aboard as my husband was flying in first class (empty cabin) the purser invited me to join him. What a difference it makes. So glad for the double upgrade in the same flight. Service was good purser was friendly service oriented and professional. The 777-200 is showing its age but the first class suite is still very comfortable.
3056,London - Miami Return January 2015 (Boeing 777). I could only choose where I wanted to sit 24 hrs before my flight which was fine as most airlines have that policy but what really threw me back was that all aisle and window seats cost an extra $69 - $100 each way depending where the seat was located! You have to pay extra for an aisle seat at the back of the plane on a 10hr transatlantic flight? This is not easyjet or Ryanair for goodness sake! The so called cheap flight on a major airline was not so cheap after all as they were already nickel and diming before getting off the ground. I refused to pay and went for a free middle seat which I loath I have wide shoulders and have to hunch inwards my plan was to arrive early and hope the check-in desk could sort me out with an aisle seat which they were able to do but that is where the Customer satisfaction stopped.) Plane was on time and boarding was reasonably quick and I was perched in my aisle seat which was very narrow I also noticed many people getting their roller cases stuck in the aisles as they tried to roll them down but it turns out that in an effort to squeeze an extra seat in each row American Airlines compromised with narrower seats and aisles. In the air nightmare #1 The narrow aisle caused one particular cabin crew to bump the trolley into my shoulder or elbow without even so much as an apology. #2 You get free beer and wine but the entire cabin ran out beer and white wine before the first drinks trolley finished its first pass. #3 The plane was old and the only movies available played at set times (not on demand) that's right 2015 with 90s technology - AA may have painted their planes but they are still old and nasty inside. Worst of all it was the same experience on the return leg mercifully the flight was 60 mins less - A truly awful transatlantic flight!
3057,Flying home from Rochester NY to Los Angeles CA I had to change planes in Chicago. Our flight from Rochester landed with plenty of time to make the connecting flight. One problem is that we had to park on the tarmac for one and a half hours. Another plane was occupying the gate. When we reached the gate it took the employees forever to bring up the valeted bags. I missed the connecting flight and it was late in the evening so there wasn't any available flights. I asked about other airlines in the morning and was told nothing was available. I was given stand-by for AA in the morning and if I didn't make that then an 8.05 pm flight was booked for me. AA wouldn't pay for a hotel room so I was on my own. Once I got to a hotel and started my computer I found a United and Virgin America flight for the morning. Of course it cost me more money but I had a meeting the next day and couldn't risk the stand-by status. What a difference dealing with Virgin America customer service over American Airlines. I will only use AA as a last resort in my future trips. American couldn't tell me how many people were on stand-by for the morning flight so I could evaluate my chance of boarding.
3058,JFK-MIA-JFK. Priority check-in at JFK was awful. The AA staff were absolutely rude and unhelpful to the point that she was yelling. It was an appalling experience. Things got better on-board first leg on a newly configured 767 as a last minute equipment change. The new First Class seats are extremely comfortable. There were tons of storage space and it went completely flat. Flight attendants on this flight were very friendly pro-active and interactive. Breakfast was delicious and creative. Overall an absolutely delightful flight the new cabin is gorgeous. Return flight in Main Cabin Extra and this time ground staff in MIA was much friendlier than JFK. Exit row seats were comfortable and entertainment options were decent. Overall another great experience with AA despite the bad impression at JFK.
3059,What is the point in paying extra for Priority when the seats are still the same size? Not to mention the overhead bins are not full yet you made me check my one carry-on. This is ridiculous. I planned ahead and packed lightly so I could use a small carry bag. I have an appointment when I land and cannot wait for Baggage Claim. What should have been offered was Priority Baggage PickUp. These items should come off the plane first and be stowed with strollers or other items along with First Class baggage. I will avoid this airline at all costs going forward.
3060,DUS-ORD-Tampa-LAX-ORD-DUS. We fly on European carriers quite often - but American Airlines have made an art of employing non caring - ignorant and unfriendly staff. I have never encountered such condescending flight attendants - and such arrogance. We flew from Dusseldorf to Chicago as first leg. The seat allocation was a disaster at the airport - my wife was in a middle seat 6 rows behind me. When we asked the check in crew to change it - we were told to take care of it at the gate at the gate we were told to sort it with the cabin crew and the cabin crew? Not our problem - you should have taken care of it before boarding - end of interest. Only after I really got angry - and walked off the plane - telling them to get my luggage off - a steward from the front end of the plane got involved and shuffled people around so we could sit together. Our friendly stewardess then managed to ignore us for the whole trip. Second leg - we were on the last row of an ancient DC9 - with the galley next to us and a toilet door that would not close properly. Return trip uneventful - but one thing is certain - never again American.
3061,AA78 DFW-LHR March 6 2015. What a disappointing flight on one of AA's ancient 777-200 cabin feels more like a prison cell than business class. Seats in 2-3-2 configuration (haven't had this for 15 years now). Instead of lie- flat seats they still offer lie in s-style and be careful not to slip down to the floor while you sleep. Stewardess climbing over me to cut off the way she had to walk. Food was disappointing as well. Only highlight was the wine selection that was a little bit better than ok. No way that I will use AA again.
3062,DFW-LHR in B773. Not sure what other people want but I got what I expected. Good steak for dinner accompanied with a nice Pinot Noir form New Zealand seat turns into a comfortable bed IFE is excellent flight attendants had right mix of anticipating what you need and leaving you in peace. on the down side overhead bin space is limited compared to Business cabin.
3063,LAX-ORD-CDG - First - the segment from ORD-CDG was on refurbished 767 with new style biz class seats. Very nice cabin interiors are better than most European airlines. There were only two small things I did not get - table - very difficult to pull out and angle - to a point flight attendants had issues with it. And second was iPad for entertainment? Really. The planes have new seats! What was worst was that the purser collected the iPads and head phones 4 hours before we landed! So there was no entertainment. And when I asked why they collected it so early they said they were preparing for landing. 4 hours ahead? The same on 777-300ER they keep collecting the headphones at least 1 hour before landing therefore you can't use the system. But the food was ok and apart from the unfriendly purser the staff were nice.
3064,I traveled reluctantly on American Airlines Buenos Aires - New York and return in early December 2014. On the most recent trip I can only say that the seating was horrible the flight attendants inattentive. I did like two attendants on the return flight one a male who saw the girl sitting next to me unwilling to put her tray up for takeoff and he firmly said 'you know the drill put the tray up'. You could sense his professionalism and no nonsense approach. He was quite professional. Another attendant was very personal with me and admitted that flying was not what it used to be said that the 777-300 had two back seats that you could not recline and actually defended the passenger in terms of lack of comfort. She said that now it is a question of bringing your own entertainment food all of which surprised me since she was not party line and quite personable apologizing for making me wait ten minutes for some water saying 'I'm sorry I'm in another world today' not so reassuring but she was on top of things. A mixed bag. On the flight to New York the food was awful but a flight attendant when telling her that I need a lot of water subtly gave me an entire bottle in a plastic bag. Perhaps it's because I helped an older passenger with her luggage but still what a shocker. I find that I am very uncomfortable getting off their planes. They have twice lost my luggage once on an earlier flight but found it days later. The latest was really just uncomfortable because of the 2x5x2 seating arrangement on a 777-200. I cannot recommend them for comments like 'whose the next victim?' or 'the entertainment system is not working. We suggest you read a good book and go to sleep'. This was on a flight Buenos Aires New York about three years ago stated in Spanish and English by a flight attendant. Passengers laughed but you could see many were offended by her suggestions. It used to be a great carrier.
3065,Sitting at AEX. Flight 3271 was scheduled for 6.05am. It is currently 8.20am and still not boarded. There is always delays. I travel for business and American is so inconsistent it makes it hard for the business traveler.
3066,Recently we traveled to Cancun from Calgary Canada with an over nighter in Dallas Fort Worth. Our flights down were for the most part uneventful with only minor delays out of Calgary and Dallas. However coming back on the 28th of Feb was the worst experience we have ever had in over 30 years of flying. We were stuck in an enormous backlog of passengers in Cancun Airport the majority of the backlog was with American Airlines. Not withstanding the fact that there were storms all over the southern US the American staff assisting passengers in the line-up un-organized cluster that accrued in the terminal was appalling! They could not organize anything and upset passengers constantly. They were so incompetent that they would have had difficulty organizing a staff bathroom break. We where in the line-up for 5.5 hours and never saw a listing for our flight till we finally went through security and even then they had the gate location mixed up. A horrendously poor experience.
3067,"I had an unpleasant experience with this airline on Sunday March 1st. I took a flight from Houston to Chicago then had an hour to connect to my flight to Toronto. The first leg was fine on time and was surprised that a meal was served on a short two hour flight. I got to Chicago checked the departure board and saw my flight was delayed an hour. That was not too bad so I used the washroom came out to get a coffee and decided to check the board for the gate again and to my surprise my flight was then listed as cancelled. Told that even though I had booked first class if I wanted to get to Toronto the next morning it would be in the back of economy told that the only first class available would be in two days. The biggest surprise came shortly thereafter when I went to search for a Customer Relations desk: there was none! There was a system of phones. Eventually a CS agent came to the phone. She told me that the previous gate agent booked me for the following night from Chicago to Philadelphia then a six hour wait to board a 7 am flight back up to Toronto getting me to my destination two days after the original time. I instead took charge and asked if I could get a flight to Buffalo and was placed on one for two hours later. Of course ""weather"" was the cause for the delay but oddly enough only my flight was showing up as being cancelled. I fly often so if weather was a major factor the board should have at least a few more cancellations or delays. Because of this ""weather"" excuse there would be no assistance for a hotel. I was to depart from the L gates and just before boarding there came an announcement that we had to go over to the H gates- - with just minutes to spare. Service has been much better to me by other US based airlines when faced with unusual changes such as weather or mechanical delays-I have had them all. I will stick to my preferred airline and not use AA anymore as this experience plus a similar one last summer with them has completely eroded any confidence that this airline can get me from point A to B on the same day."
3068,MSP-MIA. A battered old airplane arrives at the gate looking like it would be from 1960. We got inside and some of the monitors were not working and the seats barely reclined. The flight attendants were very nice and passed out drinks but I still don't understand why they do not offer snacks on a 3.5 hour flight. My flight from MIA-MSP was terrible. We arrived at MIA airport getting ready for our flight at 1pm. We find out it is cancelled and the airline did not give us a reason why so we were rescheduled for a 2pm flight. When we went to board the 2pm flight we find out that they cancelled our seats for that flight and replaced them with a 9pm flight. We had to stay in MIA airport for an additional 7 hours! Once the time finally comes to board the flight bound to MSP we get onto the plane which previously came from Mexico City. The flight attendants were very welcoming however they then tell us over the speaker that this plane was out of service and that American Airlines must find us a new plane to fly on. So we get all of our luggage off the plane and leave the gate once again tired and exhausted. We wait in the gate area and find out our plane is located at the opposite end of MIA airport a 25 minute walk/train ride to get to. So we get all of our stuff together and head towards the other gate. Boarding begins immediately on one of the brand new planes and it is delayed an additional hour. The flight finally leaves at 11pm and I was supposed to be home at 6pm originally. We got to Minneapolis at 2am. Do not recommend this airline if you have little kids with you as changes to occur commonly but the flight attendants are great. The flights not so much. American has really gone down in service.
3069,I cannot find one thing to say about this airline that is complimentary. Had a flight from Orlando to home and arrived 2 hrs early. Line and kiosks were absolutely packed. And why is that? Because there are only 2 check in people working. Of course I am late for my flight and spend the rest of the day trying to get on a stand by. AA workers at the gates very unhelpful and dismissive. Tell me if I am not some kind of gold customer I cant be put on a stand by list. Terrible customer service in every way. I will never fly them again and do not recommend anyone else to either!
3070,After a cruise in Ft. Lauderdale we took a connector flight to Dallas on the way to Phoenix. Upon arrival had to sit in the plane 2.5 hours as there was a plane in our gate. Because of snow and ice on runway and also because Dallas is not prepared for this and American could not find a pilot we were cancelled. So for the next 24 hours we spend in the Dallas Fort worth airport we spend 8 hours waiting in lines for a flight and slept along with about 100 people on the floors and in chairs in the airport as the hotels were full. I felt sorry for seniors would had to endure this drama as there was little to no help from American Airlines. Finally after 2 cancellations and 1 standby refusal we found a flight to Phoenix.
3071,Flight from MSP to DFW to MIA was late both flights and each time they were highly unorganized. Late to board and very uninformative to passengers. Flight itself ok. Very uncomfortable seats and I'm an extremely small figured person. Flight returning from MIA to DFW and then to MSP was a disaster! Got to the airport 2.5 hrs early and had American Airlines bump my flight unbeknown to me to a following day! They put me on standby with a confirmed seat and then argued when I didn't get on that I was late when I was there an hour before departure. They did not out me on and when talking to a supervisor and his pawn they did nothing claiming it was not their fault even though I had a confirmed seat on time and they bumped me. They did nothing to appease the situation and the girl behind the counter was very rude! I will never fly them again. Disorganized unprofessional and expensive!
3072,"After 30+ years of flying American I will now avoid them. My flight from Heathrow to Miami ""First"" was appalling with a complete lack of the usual amenities. The plane was old and tired media system small and ancient only 1 current movie of interest terrible food (inedible) and tantamount to false advertising in my eye to call this ""first class"". Be warned that unless you know the exact year and configuration of the plane you are flying the customer service department won't give you a definite answer you may have the same experience."
3073,Flew AA Cost Rica-Miami-Toronto. Ancient airplanes with drop down televisions every few rows. Couldn't read anything on the screens. Staff unhelpful and I never saw one of them smile. The man beside me (mistakenly) asked to purchase some cheese and crackers. The attendant literally threw a menu at him and hissed that they didn't have cheese and crackers. The seats were painfully thin and I could not get comfortable even in the Exit row isle. The only bonus you got a full can of pop although I asked for ginger ale and they didn't have any. Service only came through once and people were all complaining that they were parched and would like water.
3074,Booked on a Sunday morning flight from Miami to New York. Arrived at 6.50 for an 8.10am flight. There must have been 10 lines along a large expanse of the terminal. We were misdirected 4 times to the wrong line. The lines were 4 layers thick and moved incredibly slowly. We stood on one line for 40 minutes before we began to fear we would miss our flight because of the slow pace of check in. The American line attendants were unhelpful. They suggested self- check in but I explained that I had a dog. He then told me I was in the wrong line. The correct line was equally long and I missed my flight. I will never travel AA again. There are other choices between Miami and NY and AA is not less expensive.
3075,Flew from Philadelphia to Dublin old plane unfriendly staff - one screen for 50 people and 1 movie in 5 hours. Pasta and bread tasted the same and fixed recline for seats. Unsatisfactory! Will switch to another airline next time.
3076,"Business class LAX-MIA-SXM and back. I booked seats 9 months out. Two weeks before departure my wife and I were separated. After four calls and ""It can't be fixed"" answers it was finally fixed via email. Of the four segments all but the first ones were quite enjoyable. The first a red eye out of LAX was average at best. Smooth boarding rock hard seats that sent my back into pain an hour out; surly unhelpful FA's. As we approached the gate in MIA the FA gave us connection information which was wrong. Had we not checked a board in the terminal we would have been sent so far out of our way we would have missed our flight. The other 3 flights were fine except for the MIA-SXM meal which was inedible. Planes were old but fairly well preserved. All flights on time. At SXM our ""priority"" bags were the last off the plane. Overall small stuff."
3077,People are getting bigger not smaller. The seats were uncomfortably tight and small. Entertainment terrible can't they put on a recent movie. Not even a cookie was served! The airline attendants were stone faced. When leaving the plane no attendants present. This is the worst airline we have been on. We will never use it again even if it is cheaper. Flights both going and coming were 45 min to 1 hr delayed. We almost missed our connecting flights both times we were the last to board the plane with rude comments from workers that they are waiting for us!
3078,All four of my flight legs were substantially delayed (one because they couldn't find one of the crew members). The airline took no responsibility for the delays-they did not have enough gate agents did not accommodate passengers who missed connecting flights or were trapped in airports overnight as a result of the delays and were extremely rude to passengers who asked for compensation. The seats were also very tight and I could not fit a normal sized backpack fully under the seat in front of me.
3079,Very poor long haul experience with American Airlines. Aircraft was ancient with one TV per 6 rows; wording on screens was illegible if sat at the side. Food was in edible. Crew failed to conduct a full cabin secure check with many hazards going unnoticed. Will not be flying American again.
3080,We paid a premium for a flight from Albuquerque to Orlando getting in at 5pm. As it turned out we could have arrived earlier on the cheaper flight with another carrier. We were delayed as always when flying AA. Eventually got in over 3 hours late. Asked for some level of compensation for getting in late even though we paid a premium for this particular schedule. Received an email saying we won't be giving any compensation and of course could not reply to the email. Sadly I will no longer fly this carrier. It has just been too many problems delays etc.
3081,"I am mostly an international flyer on Qatar Etihad and BA. I have been flying American a lot in the US in the past 18 months and have to say I have been pleasantly surprised. This weekend there was a bad storm that closed Washington area airports and I had to get back from Miami to make an international departure the following day. Two of my flights were cancelled. The agent at the Admirals Club stuck with it for almost an hour as we strategized a way to get near enough to DCA so I could have options to get home (eventually I got to PHL and rented a car). The only slightly sour note was the agent's supervisor came over saying ""no...no...no.."" and she couldn't be bothered with trying to understand what we were trying to do. Seeing I was now getting really angry the supervisor pulled back and the agent got me near enough on a USAir flight. USAir had their own agent in the Club and he got us on a waitlist for an even earlier flight which proved to be a Godsend. And after all that my baggage eventually made it to DC after the storm with no drama. Of course I am Oneworld Gold and we were flying first class and I didn't have to stand in a mile long line in the main terminal. But that's what you're paying for and often US airlines don't treat you very well no matter how much you paid for the ticket. I also have found AA is incredibly helpful on the phone in changing reservations even on codeshare flights which is something I have to do frequently. Their website is extremely good and links nicely with other airlines if you are on a complicated itinerary that includes one of their flights. I know people who gripe about them but for now they're my go-to US airline."
3082,Travelled from Miami to London on January 8th 2015 in first class. Very bad service and very shabby cabin. Here's a warning. Our meal was extremely disappointing it was cold and when we complained the meals were taken away and re-heated not safe. Also and worse still was my wife's meal. She needs Gluten Free food but her meal was terrible some chicken and rice which again was cold. When my wife made comments to the senior steward she told us that due to AA cutbacks they are withdrawing special meals. This was not denied by AA customer relations so if you have any kind of special dietary needs do not fly AA. Be warned.
3083,AA from BOS to MIA on Jan 26 (rather than on the 28th to avoid the storm) next in business MIA to Santiago Chile on the 28th as scheduled. Returned in economy Montevideo Uruguay on Feb 10 to MIA (rather than on the 11th to avoid a predicted storm). Finally on to BOS in first on February 12. I wish the in-the-air product always equalled the consistently excellent service we receive at the Platinum desk. Based on three of the four flights we found the experience professional. The flight however from Montevideo to Miami was characterized by perfunctory service with the crew basically invisible expect for the required meal service. When we boarded they were clustered together laughing. No assistance in boarding the very full plane and throughout the flight. AA has a lock on this flight; should do better. Primitive inflight system not working. Ratings below based on MVD-MIA flight not the other three which were fine.
3084,JFK to GIG on Nov 21st and return on November 30 from GIG to JFK. Flying business class all over the world with different airlines. They are by far the worst that I have experienced. Lousy old planes broken seats and tray tables entertainment system consists of ipads horrible food and drinks selections (half of what is on the menu not available). They are known to cancel flights for mechanical failures. The crew were nice and were aware of their company's issues.
3085,LAX-DFW-MEX and return - First/Business Class. My expectations were set fairly low as these were my 11th and 12th transit of DFW on American over the last 6-7 years but wanted to burn off some miles. Of these trips I can now say that 2 have departed on time out of this place. That said my trip down to MEX was uneventful. Food was fair at best and F/A's smiles seemed missing but was on time. The departure out of MEX back to Dallas was delayed by Radar problems at MEX. This set off a chain of events that resulted in a missed connection at DFW and while 90% could be attributed to the Radar problem. The flight was not posted on airport monitors and the gate was changed. The departure gate did not have the flight displayed so people had to ask if this was indeed for the DFW flight. Once on board the pilot announced a 59 minute traffic delay due to an early full ground stop. That 59 minutes went by plus another 20 or so with no further word from the crew. Late passengers arrived about an hour after the scheduled time and once loaded the door was shut and we pushed back. Since I signed up for Emails I received no fewer than 14 Emails that I didn't read until arrival in DFW which caused connection confusion that even one of their agents could not explain. As it turned out due to carry on bag only I could have made my first flight but apparently they gave my seat away thinking there would be no way I could make it. Coming into DFW I checked online and it showed what looked like I had been rebooked on the 2nd of 2 remaining flights but Emails after arrival which were generic made me think I had been rebooked on the first of the two. All 3 remaining flights were at different terminals which didn't help. Food offered on both return legs was ridiculous same thing on both flights which means they boarded the little biscuit sandwiches at DFW flew them to MEX to serve on the return flight.
3086,Flew PHL-AMS return on 757-200 in January 2015. No frills single aisle plane was on time and food was fine - one glass of wine free. I brought my own iPad full of movies because of the lack of AVOID. No person sat beside me so plenty of room. Staff was efficient but they need to fix a loose door in the loo (was broken on the outbound and return flights no excuse).
3087,Travelling from Bogota to London via Miami we lost our connecting flight at Miami Airport due to delay of our first flight with American Airlines. We waited 5 hrs in a long queue with other passengers that have also lost connecting flights with AA. AA staff was really impolite. Their only offer was to travel to Dallas next day and from there to London. They didn't offer accommodation and we stayed all night at Miami Airport (12 hours) We finally reached London 24 hrs after our initially scheduled time. They didn't offer any kind of compensation. Never travel again with AA.
3088,JFK-Bermuda-JFK. Flight to Bermuda uneventful though only soft drinks served despite being an International flight at dinner hour nary a peanut to be seen. Seat comfort was reasonable for a 1 hr 37 min flight. One flight attendant was extraordinarily rude and sassy loudly scolding numerous passengers about a number of trumped up infractions. Return flight to JFK was overbooked so we and others were hauled into an American Airlines office told we would have to be rebooked the following day. After waiting a while with no further time left to clear customs American told us to be re-booked each passenger would have to pay an additional $298 above the flight ticket already paid plus a fine. American refused even to ask if other flights (Delta or Jet Blue) had space later that day when no one was willing to pay all the extra charges to re-book on American the following morning or even tell us where the other two airlines were located. As it turned out Delta had only Business Class seats available (they said) but Jet Blue could accommodate everyone for a charge of $198 per person. American is clearly not very customer friendly and one would think twice about flying with them again in the future. JetBlue as it turned out had more leg room served a snack and their crew onboard was much better organized and politer than American had been.
3089,AA0071 1/12/2015 FRA-DFW. Actually my flight was with Etihad however the connection from Frankfurt to Dallas Fort Worth was with American Airlines. The plane outside looked great however once I boarded it looked like I was still in the 1960's. Damaged/not working light switches ugly and dirty seats and the 12 hour long flight had no monitor to watch anything. I will try to avoid American Airlines in future.
3090,AA86 on Jan 22: ORD-LHR 767-300. Used Flagship Lounge before boarding - always great service there and one of the ladies always remembers me with a hello and chat. Boarding was quick - seat 6G and Business Class was full. Coach was around 70% full. Greeted by attendant on boarding and once at my seat attendant came and took my jacket and offered water/champagne/OJ. Took off on time and post-take off drinks were served with nuts. Dinner was halibut that was excellent and the F/A's were very attentive. Bose headsets always great and Samsung tablet had sufficient shows to watch. Slept 4 1/2 hours and asked for breakfast - was brought right away. Circled a couple times and landed at Terminal 3 - off the plane quickly and transferred to T5 for flight to Brussels. Really think AA is doing great - hope it continues.
3091,On 1/18 flew from Omaha to DFW to New Orleans. Flight very uneventful. Even arrived in Dallas early and had to wait for another plane to pull out so we had a gate to pull up to. Made the connection to New Orleans easily and the flight was on time. On 1/25 flew from New Orleans to DFW to Omaha. Flight was on time until we boarded in Dallas and wait to wait nearly an hour so light bulbs on the wing could be replaced. Since I don't fly much I was satisfied that the flights for the most part were on time and uneventful.
3092,GRB to HNL via ORD and DFW. Five of 6 segments were on time or up to 30 minutes early. Ground and cabin staff were personable passed beverages 4 times on long-haul outbound but service was very lean on return (no coffee on a flight arriving at 5 am). Cabins clean seats adequately cushioned but a tight fit as expected. The entree salad I purchased was tasty and priced fairly. Entertainment is really inadequate on B767-300 with overhead video and no music channels at all on return. Unfortunately American Eagle is really a hot mess except for nice cabin staff. On final segment five schedule changes were sent to my phone in a 30 minute period-30 minute delay no just 5 minutes back to 30 minutes etc. The final message indicated just a 5 minute delay but after we boarded we sat on the plane for another 50 minutes while they located a new captain anyway. In my experience if you must use American Eagle shoot for the first flight of the day.
3093,We used American for the first and last time 1/5/14 for a flight to Cabo (flight 1087). We had a transfer in Chicago that's where the nightmare began. We arrived 15 minutes early but had to wait for almost 1.5 hrs to get off the plane. The pilot said the gate was not clear yet because we were early then they were de-icing then the baggage handlers then crew problems. Our connecting flight was delayed an hour so we would just make it. The flight was scheduled for 10 am delayed until 11 but no gate given then 12 then 2 then 3 then 4 then 5 then 6. We found out sometime after 2 that the plane was in Seattle. They never offered an apology although they did give us 12 dollar meal vouchers. We got 2 sandwiches and had to pay for our sodas. We were scheduled to be in Cabo at noon that day but did not get there until 10pm. A day of our vacation was lost 9 hours of aggravation and never offered any compensation for this terrible service. Just a quick comparison we went to Cancun in November on Southwest airlines they had a problem processing our boarding passes 20 minute delay we were afraid we were not going to be able to go but they got the problem fixed. If you have a choice for flights choose a company that cares.
3094,"In spite of the fact that we booked and paid for a $4K vacation a month before the actual travel AA wouldn't assign my husband and I actual seats. This meant we couldn't print out boarding passes before getting to the airport. However if we were willing to pay extra $ they would give us seat assignments. In coach. They were basically holding the seats hostage unless we paid a ransom to free them. When I enquired w/ AA as to why they actually said that our $4K payment gave us the ""service"" of flight/flying not the actual seat. They also said seat assignments were handled by the gate. An out and out lie since an extra $60 or more would have gotten us seat assignments on the spot."
3095,JFK-DFW-GRU-JFK. First leg on a brand-new 737 seats were comfortable and flight attendants were friendly. They went above and beyond looking for an item that I lost during the flight checking the seat cushions and pockets and profusely apologizing when they couldn't find it. Next leg on the 777-300ER. Seats were once again comfortable although legroom was a bit tight but was not much of an issue since I had the entire row to myself. Recline was excellent although it was a little too much that when the person in front of me reclined there was very limited space. Flight attendants on this flight were once again very friendly and professional. Catering was excellent both quantity and quality. Return flight to JFK on a 777-300ER again. This time seated in Main Cabin Extra. Legroom and recline was great there were plenty of space to move around. Flight attendants and catering were once again excellent dinner was one of the best meals I had on a plane. Service on this flight was very attentive. So Kudos to AA! The only issue was the IFE had to be rebooted a couple of times other than that the system offers a lot of variety and options. Overall as a loyal United customer I was pretty impressed with AA! Service was warm and friendly and the 777-300ER product is reliable and comfortable.
3096,"Flew from Seattle to Santiago via Miami. The flight to Miami was uneventful on a 737. The flight to Santiago left much to be desired on an antique 767. Seats were uncomfortable and stained. The meal was bland and unappetizing to look at - made the mistake of having the chicken. The old school ""entertainment"" system was a throwback to the 70's and the movie was only available in Spanish. It was a moot point though as I could not see the 12"" screen from a dozen seats away anyhow. The return flight was canceled. We were rebooked the next day on a 777 which was a welcome change. Unfortunately this plane was filthy and the FAs were quite rude. To cap it off as we were boarding we were stopped on the jetway and told that AA has a no outside drinks policy so we would have to throw out the bottles of water we bought airside before boarding our 10 hour flight. On the plane I timed it and after the original thimble of water it took 5 hours to get another one. I learned my lesson and AA will not get my business again."
3097,Flight 1021 on January 24 from Granada to Miami. This was a terribly crowded and hot plane. Flight duration was about 3 hrs 45 mins. The flight attendants made a single pass through the cabin to offer drink service and pick up cups which took no more than an hour and a half. After this they were not seen for the last 2 hrs 15 mins of the flight. I found three flight attendants seated at the rear of the plane. I have never had worse inflight service and had never seen a more lazy group of flight attendants.
3098,London (LHR) to Los Angeles (LAX) via Chicago (ORD) in First. Bag drop at LHR was easy. Flagship lounge a little antiseptic but welcoming enough. Boarding straightforward. Plane on the transatlantic section looked a little tired inside but the seat was enormous and very comfortable. Food and drinks very good and service outstanding. If I have a gripe it's that the IFE wasn't great and the TV of poor quality. Domestic leg was OK but I wouldn't expect the same class of treatment on such a flight.
3099,Booked flight and hotel with Travelbag and was horrified to discover that I was flying with AA! We flew economy from Heathrow to Miami Miami to San Jose. Check-in was good and we got good exit row seats on the first flight. Second flight we got bad seats and rude staff. Return journey again we got good exit row seats but had more bad staff does AA specialise in them? Not as bad as I thought but due to rude staff I won't be rushing to fly with them again.
3100,"Flight 287. Our Flight was supposed to be non-stop from Miami to LA. Plane developed a problem as we sat waiting to leave the terminal. It took 2 hours to determine it was not fixable. We were compensated with headsets and two granola bars while we waited for the news that American Airlines was trying to find another plane. No plane was available so we deplaned and waited another hour in the terminal for the decision to fly to Phoenix where we could refuel on the same plane and go on to LA. By now the flight is 4 hours late leaving. Arriving in Phoenix the captain said ""Good news is we are in Phoenix the bad news is the crew has to stand down due to FAA regulations."" Another delay - All the passengers were shuttled around to other flights. It's late we are all exhausted and had been lead along by a string of lies. We missed our connecting flight by 6 hours and had to stay in LA. Two granola bars and a pair of headsets. One lie leads to another creating distress for the passengers and the consequent employees that had to deal with the avalanche that resulted from a full-flight of unhappy flyers. It was a nightmare. I will never fly American again."
3101,DFW to Milan Italy via JFK in December 2014. On check in for this flight at DFW the agent informs us the flight is over sold in economy so we inquire about being switched to British Airways on the non-stop to LHR then on-wards to Milan. The AA Agent looks puzzled and quickly said we cannot switch you to BA. At this point we are confused as AA/BA have a tie up we know for a fact Delta can put you on Air France if the flight is over sold. So then we head to JFK with the domestic leg good on a new plane. At the AA terminal 8 at JFK we come to find out the AA lounge coupons given to use are no good but the AA Agent in the lounge makes an exception for the lounge since Christmas is around the corner. Finally we board the AA flight to Milan. Since we own the AA credit card we are allowed to board with Zone 2 but the red jacket agent stops us saying your AA Credit Card is useless and does not work for zone 2. Finally get on the flight and the flight leaves on time. Meals and service were good as AA has to compete with Emirates on this sector but AA really lacks any economy class in flight entertainment. There are no personal TV screens in each seat like Emirates offers. The seats in economy class are too small on AA. Since AA has put TV screens every few rows no one can sleep on this flight as the lighting from the TV screens is very annoying. To end the flight the Breakfast was very good in economy. Overall if AA would match Emirates with proper in flight offering in economy class they would have a good product but till they do this one is better offer taking Emirates if flying to Milan in Economy class.
3102,I have 2 children. One is 8 month and the other one 2.5 years. They don't give priority to board the plane to families with babies nor seniors. Secondly the staff who help you when you are checking in are useless. When you get to the airport you have to check in using their computers but if you are traveling with infants you have to line up for more than an hour. When we lined up an AA employee approached us and confirmed that we were in the right line. One hour later the staff member who was about to help us check in said that we were in the wrong line. Once at the gate they didn't give preference to families with babies. Somebody said through the speaker that there wasn't enough room for our carry-ons and that we had to check them in at no cost. When we approached the staff member at the front desk guy to ask him where to leave the carry on he ignored us. Lastly this airline charges you extra for your luggage. Our ticket was very expensive and on top of that we had to pay extra for our baggage. This is the first and last time that I travel with them.
3103,I try to avoid them whenever I can but as a student I have to go for the cheapest so I gave them another try from Miami to Milan. First of all no private screens on a 9 hour journey should be banned. Although I did sleep most of the time I would have liked to listen to some music or watch a movie of my choice not chosen by them. Besides that the aircraft didn't seem very well kept and the food was just bad. To make the matter worse the plane was delayed by 6 hours and they kept changing our gate telling the plane was broken. Would try to avoid them if you can.
3104,LHR-LAX flight in business class: new 777 aircraft. Excellent flight very attentive crew (best ever on AA) good IFE and WiFi which was a great treat - $19 for a 10 hr flight is not unreasonable but you would perhaps expect to be free of charge for First and Business Class travelers? SFO-ORD-LHR: flights in Main Cabin Extra. The usual 737 for the internal flight which was fine. Again attentive staff. The leg from ORD to LHR was on a very old and dated 767 which you really no longer would expect to exist in a company from a 1st world country? IFE broke down so everyone had to make do with their own entertainment options. Cabin crew were excellent again. I fell asleep as we took off and missed my meal when I woke up I was offered it within 10-15 minutes. I have had a fair few flights with American in the past to the US and because my partner has Executive Platinum status with them we always do tend to get upgrades to business class but have never thought much of the service so far. Clearly American is staff is making an effort! The quality of service has really improved.
3105,"Why is there always some ""breakdown"" with American? I live in Alexandria LA and only have three choices and unfortunately I am forced to fly AA. Normally only 1 out of 4 flight go without some type problem. Always late or delayed. Flight Crew doesn't show up. Gates are changed sometimes up to 5 times. And lost bags are the norm. Why can't AA get their game together?"
3106,In the air American was decent. We flew TUS-DFW-BNA and EVV-ORD-TUS and found the flight crew to be friendly and helpful for the most part. The issues we had were with customer service on the ground particularly in Dallas where our missed flight did not result in any support for our troubles. They also lost our luggage but they apologized and compensated us appropriately sending a check in a very timely manner. The MD-80s they fly are fine but the fact that I flew in a plane 5 years younger than me doesn't do much for my faith in the company. American Eagle's ERJs are horrible for anyone over 5 feet tall and they feel dated. The newer 737s were nice however.
3107,Nov 10th AA2216. AA2463 Nov 11th. Our flight from LA to SYD was QF12 on Nov 11 2014. I would like to give American Airlines a poor review on their performance and customer service we experienced on a flight to Sydney Australia in November 2014. Our flight was delayed leaving MSP partially due to weather but really because they left us sitting on the plane while they delayed the de-icing and then took 45 minutes to do something the pilot said usually takes 15 minutes. We missed our connecting flight in DFW that was to take us to Sydney and the ticket attendants there absolutely refused to re-route us onto several flights that could have taken us to LAX to connect to a flight to SYD that same night. They instead put us on a flight the next day that would re-route us through LAX and on to SYD making us lose an entire day in Australia. The ticket attendants were rude and inconsiderate. I have never had such poor customer service in all my years of flying. DFW said it is a policy not to allow someone on a flight through stand-by if their end destination is international. American Airlines said each airport has their own policy on that and it is not a standard AA policy. There were several flights that went from DFW to LAX that evening and they allowed over 30 people to board those planes on stand-by but would not allow us to.
3108,JFK-SFO-LAX-LAS-JFK with American Airlines were the worst four flights of my life! Ground staff and cabin crew were rude and inefficient. The cabin and seats were very old and worn out. Not a single crew member on any four of the flights I took even bothered to say hello or welcome or even smile. Obviously we had to purchase snacks onboard because AA does not offer food. The snack options were very limited and if you were seated at the very back of the economy cabin you will never be guaranteed whether you will get the snacks you wanted to buy because they only stock few onboard and they get sold out half way through. Even during the selling of snacks and drinks the cabin crew looked very displeased that they had to do it. The cabin crew were extremely badly groomed. The economy seat had hardly any legroom. If you are a tall person you will have a hard time moving in your seat because it is so small with no legroom. We even bought extra legroom seats and still there was not enough legroom. All four flights were delayed and took off hours late. We were boarded late and then had to sit in the aircraft for at least 1 to 2 hours before take off. As a result our plans had to be cancelled and changed. I will never fly with AA again.
3109,I flew from LHR-MIA in Business on one of their new 777-300. I cant fault this flight. The seats in Business have lots of space places for storage and good size IFE screens. IFE itself is also good. Food was of a good quality. Service was very good from the crew who were pleasant friendly and were happy to keep your drink topped up. If you're feeling peckish during the flight the galley is stocked with snacks where you can help yourself. Overall a very pleasant on time flight. In contrast I flew the return with BA on a very worn 747 business class cabin is badly designed and crew not very friendly at all. If you are doing this route definitely choose AA over BA miles better product!
3110,I have never seen anything like I saw today at MIA. We arrived an hour and a half before my son's domestic flight and could not believe the chaos at American's ticket counters. There were long lines at every kiosk and even longer lines at the checked bag line. After finally checking in at a kiosk my son could not print his boarding pass because the machine had run out of paper. I had been standing in the checked bag line and when we approached the employee and explained that we had a luggage tag but the boarding pass had not printed she directed us to another line that had easily more than 60 people! I then approached another American Airlines employee and asked for assistance and she was incredibly rude and offered no help. Fortunately we were able to get my son's boarding pass on the phone. Despite a ridiculous security check-in line he was able to board his flight on time. A friend of his that was on the same flight had to forcefully argue with other employees to get on the flight because they said they had closed the gate and would not let him board even though he was checked in!
3111,Last January 13th I took my flight back from Madrid Spain to JFK AA 095 we started our flight two hours late not being informed about time or anything similar we were not allowed to leave the area inside the airport where our plane was and if we wanted they said that they would open our carry-on bags totally. We boarded and when we were boarding they informed us that we had a stop in Goose bay Canada to have gas otherwise we would not be able to get to New York the stop was 1h 30m long. We arrive in JFK so late that almost everybody lost their connection. However we were given new connections once we got out of the plane. But they did not give us any voucher or anything in compensation for this horrible flight. I would try not to fly American Airlines again.
3112,Flight Miami to LHR 13/01. Technically the flight was good early arrival very soft touchdown and excellent information from flight deck. However the cabin service left a lot to be desired. The crew were very unhelpful and the food poor by the standards of comparable airlines. Our return trip to the UK (operated by AA) was far inferior to our outward trip to Boston operated by BA. Given the choice at a comparable price level I would not fly with AA again.
3113,Itinerary: Chicago - Miami - Campinas Brasil. Flight from MIA to VRP was canceled because the AA crew did not show up. Service crew for the make-up flight were very nice and accommodating but the AA staff at MIA were not very friendly at all and we had to search for them after seeing our flight was canceled. On all legs the planes were AA and not very clean at all. Overall I lost a couple days traveling and when I arrived I felt dirtier than when I have flown better international carriers not to mention no personalized inflight entertainment or WiFi. Two thumbs down for international AA.
3114,"I recently flew from Brazil to Los Angeles on American Airlines and it was the longest most uncomfortable international flight I have ever been on. In addition to the dirty looking and old interior the broken flush button on the toilet and the only semi-functioning ""entertainment"" device the staff were rude and had horrible attitudes. One flight attendant actually rolled her eyes at me when I asked for headphones. Her response was ""Don't you have an iPod or something that you have headphones for"". When I said no she rolled her eyes and said she would see if they had any but everyone brings their own headphones now. The food was horrible as well. It was the most unpleasant flying experience I have ever had. I will avoid flying American Airlines at all costs in the future."
3115,New York to San Francisco 20 Dec 2014 AA179. San Francisco to Los Angeles 25 Dec 2014 AA2378. Los Angeles to Las Vegas 30 Dec 2014 AA182. Las Vegas to New York 4 Jan 2015 AA120. My partner and I were extremely disappointed with everything. All 4 flights were delayed not by few minutes but by hours. Later the staff would board all passengers on to the aircraft and in all the flights we would just sit on the tarmac for hours. Usually when you board the plane the CSD or the purser of the flight would greet you with a friendly smile and say welcome aboard or good morning etc. But in all the flights with AA they could not care less about passengers. Flight attendants were too busy talking to each other or. The grooming of the flight attendants was atrocious! Above all the flight attendants on all 4 flights were very rude and arrogant. They don't even bother to look or smile or talk politely with the passengers when they are boarding the flight. The seats in economy was so uncomfortable with minimal leg room. There is no comfort. It is okay for short flights but not very good for long flights like New York to San Francisco or Las Vegas to New York. We paid extra for extra legroom economy seats. Well AA should learn what extra legroom means. There was no extra legroom. The seats are terrible for tall people. I will never recommend AA.
3116,LAX-SLC on 18 July 2014 SLC-RDU on 25 July 2014 RDU-JFK on 28 July 2014. Typical AA flights and lounges- pretty ordinary. Not a patch on Qantas or BA. Ground staff at RDU did not recognise or acknowledge an international RTW J class ticket - denied baggage allowance. Had to pay $25 to check 1 bag. Why don't AA enforce carry-on bag rules? Many passengers with 3 or more overweight bags. Would we recommend AA to family & friends? Probably as they are 'less bad' than the opposition.
3117,SAN-ORD-ROC and BUF-ORD-SAN. I decided to fly paid first as the cost when booking only a few weeks out was only slightly more than economy. I've flown AA first domestically many times so didn't expect much but flying so early in the morning it was nice to have a slightly larger seat to sleep. I'm only writing this review to point out what a drastic turn for the worse after the merger. The food quality while on domestic F is never great has always been better than the rest on AA. It is now absolutely disgusting. The one positive is that first is now offered on American Eagle - a very minor improvement of course for a flight so short in duration. I really hope management wakes up and realizes that they are ruining what was a much better than average airline.
3118,"Traveled three times round trip LAX to LHR in the last 4 months of 2014: flights 136 and 135. Equipment - 777 300ER (I go out of my way to fly this plane as it is the newest and most comfortable). Business Class. Seats J12 J13 and J14 (window seats). I can't say enough good things about the seat (private and roomy flat bed) the inflight entertainment (15"" screen) and the noise-canceling headphones (sized large enough to surround the ear rather than mashing it as do the headphones on BA). In all instances the food from LAX to LHR was not good and certainly not worth the calories (the same can be said for BA). Better to eat in the Admirals Club Lounge (more on this later). The food from LHR to LAX was much better and excellent on one flight (must have a better kitchen at LHR). The LAX Admirals Lounge is comfortable enough but it is unconscionable that long-haul business class passengers are required to pay for everything beyond bar snacks and coffee. I have never paid for food in the business class lounge of any other comparably-sized airline. And we were mislead (cheated) by one of the wait staff. As an aside BA shares the Admirals Club Lounge in San Diego and as a BA passenger I wasn't charged for food in the lounge there. The LHR Admirals Club Lounge is certainly spartan but well-tended and thankfully much less crowded than the BA lounge. In fact the AA lounge was just about empty on my three visits. Yes the food in the AA lounge is limited compared to BA but at least you don't have to pay extra for it as you do in all of the Admirals Clubs in the USA. Check-in was spotty at best and miserable at worst. At LHR we had to use the check-in desk for coach passengers because there was only one business class desk in operation. I would recommend AA but only for passengers flying business class in the 777 300ER aircraft."
3119,I just flew on a Milan-Miami route with AA and thought the interior was extremely run down and dirty. No personal TV's poor choice of 2 films for a 10 hour flight cheap headsets dirty and broken toilets and disgusting food. My kids flew over thanksgiving one from Dallas to Madrid and another from JFK to Milan and the plane conditions were the same. Will never fly again AA on International flights!
3120,"NRT/ORD 777-300 I hesitated booking F/class on AA even with award travel because of their flight attendants' general culture of hostility towards passengers but I reasoned I'd be asleep for much of the flight. We sat on the tarmac for 45 minutes before taking off. When returning to my seat from the lavatory after we'd finally reached cruising altitude a flight attendant looked at me coldly and barked ""Put your seat belt on!"". There was some turbulence but this was not the way to handle it. The purser was friendly and efficient but he referred to my husband as ""Mr.---- "" and called me ""Dear"". The new seats were very comfortable though and I liked that my husband and I could spin the seats to face each other while dining (although the food was surprisingly bad). I slept well on the comfortable flat bed. If the food and service were comparable to the seat it would have been a great flight. Until then I'll continue to book transpacific premium travel on Asian carriers."
3121,"I dread flying with American Airlines but with their association with British Airways (Who are fantastic) I have to for internal American Flights. Last flight was from Boston to New York with an onward BA connection to London. Arrived at Boston airport for check in very rude AA check in attendant who was unhelpful and just plain miserable. Onwards to the departure gate screens indicated a 25 minute delay. Was not too concerned as had around 4 hours to connect onto BA flight once landed in JFK. We then spent 2.5 hours waiting at the gate with hardly any communication from AA staff apart from ""Its a weather delay"" turns out it was due to a faulty aircraft door. Anyway the four hour connection time was fast approaching and people were starting to become annoyed and very irritated. Finally ushered onto the aircraft at speed as we only had a window of 25 minutes to board and be airborne if not flight would be cancelled as the crew would be out of hours. We boarded the aircraft and took off with around 4 minutes to spare. Seatbelt signs stayed on for the whole flight and apparently due to adverse weather the crew would also remain seated so no food or drinks would be served. I have honestly never been on an AA flight whereby the crew are smiling happy to serve you and are actually grateful for you flying with them and I have taken around 8 AA flights including across the pond the attitude at times is appalling. On the same holiday I was on a delayed Delta flight from Atlanta to Boston and the difference between staff was unbelievable was even given a free beer and sincere apology for the delay and more importantly was kept informed and the crew were cheerful and happy. AA manners cost nothing!"
3122,"I am a long time traveler and loyal to American Airlines however whoever designed these ""new"" planes must have been 2 feet tall. The design is terrible. I am a slim 5'10"" and sat in a ""premium"" economy seat from Washington DC/LA on a nearly 6 hour flight. I sat next to two other tall people making it even more unpleasant. I will start with the good American has finally come into the 21st century and provides individual screens for in flight entertainment but still not nearly as good as Virgin America which also offers many free viewing options TV etc. Chargers USB are improved as well. Now the bad - the leg room and more so the seat/tray table configuration (even in premium) is appalling and even worse if the person in front of you reclines their seat which is highly likely. In my case they did and my drink ended up in my lap. If the seat in front is reclined you are pretty much trapped. The head rest ""wings"" that allow you to rest your head from side to side are so small anyone with a normal size head could not possibly use. They are ridiculous. The seat pocket basically holds nothing forget stocking up on magazines and books for your long flight as you will be carrying them in your lap or chucking them on the floor. Though it's nice to fly in a nicer and newer plane it is just shocking that no consideration was given to traveler comfort on these new planes especially if you are a over 5'2"". Not sure how the American or Boeing CEOs didn't catch this. They must have only tested out first class or they are all really short!"
3123,AA174 (Raleigh RDU-London LHR) on Dec 23 2014. We initially boarded the old rust bucket that is the 767-300 only to be disembarked a couple of hours later due to mechanical problems. They told us mechanics would have the problem fixed in 2 hours only for the inevitable announcement 3 hours later that they couldn't fix the plane and that we would depart the next morning. AA did provide hotels overnight but it was another 2 hour ordeal with 250 passengers lining up to see ONE representative. The next morning we all made our way to the gate boarded the same plane which the captain announced had been fixed and tested and waited for departure. Only we never departed. One hour later the captain announced the plane was STILL not fit to fly to the annoyance of us passengers. We had to wait a further 7 hours at the airport for another AA rust bucket 767 to come save us from London. After a 24 hour delay and 3 separate boardings for 1 flight we finally made it to London Christmas morning. My return flight (AA105) from London LHR to New York JFK operated on a brand new 777-300 was of course flawless. Lesson learned and tip: Do everything you can to avoid flying the 767 because chances are you won't be flying. They were good planes back in the 90's and 00's but they're unreliable these days. Moreover if you want entertainment and comfort avoid 767s at all costs. Ultimately AA is a good airline if you fly the right planes.
3124,"Dec 10 & 15 Economy flights - DCA to LAX & back. To LAX we were forced to sit row 11 even after we reserved ""main cabin upgrade"". Crew member informed us that the aircraft was switched. Then on the way back from LAX to DCA Dec 15 after paying extra for the upgrade ($81 for my husband's 11D & $78 for my 11E - Boarding Group 1 already included) I had to pay on top of that $15 each for Group 1 boarding - the website just did not allow me to proceed with on-line check in! Our multiple calls to Customer Service/their response were really unacceptable! E- mailed the AA Senior Leadership no courtesy response at all. Never again."
3125,January 1st Denver to Dallas Dallas to Wichita Falls. 5 hour delay in Dallas then canceled our flight. Told us no flights until Sunday/Monday refused to pay for food hotel rental and wouldn't give us our luggage. Ended up paying for my own hotel and splitting a rental with 3 other passengers. Luggage still in Dallas with no eta to get to me. 3 different calls to make a claim on luggage all three have said different information messed up my address each time and can't tell me why it wasn't delivered on next flight. Zero customer service. I will never fly AA again. I'll drive to Dallas and pay 3x as much to park my car to fly with anyone else.
3126,On flight from Austin TX to Manchester UK on 12/21/14 - paid for the additional leg room which could be better but was ok however the seats are the most uncomfortable seats ever. The more leg room you get the narrower the seat gets! 8 hrs in a cramped seat is ridiculous. My husband and I had seats 15a & b and left the armrest up between us to give us room for our arms the passenger in seat c I am thankful to say did the same thing. Seriously removing rows of seats to gain additional leg room is one thing but reducing seat widths to cram in more seats is in my opinion the most ridiculous idea they ever had. The staff were not the best and a little on the rude side. I have flown AA every time I had flown to the UK but I am considering a different airline for future trips due to the seats mainly. The captain did a great job - the entire flight was smooth.
3127,I had to book a flight from Orlando to Manchester UK the day after Christmas for a family emergency so naturally looked for the most affordable flight which by a few dollars was AA also taking into account flight times. I have flown this route with many other airlines in the past and AA was by far my worst experience. Flight left 40 mins late but did make up the time with a tail wind so we arrived on time. Some of the cabin crew were downright surly others were very pleasant. As I can't sleep on planes I rely on watching movies to pass the time but with no in-seat screens there was nothing to watch. I will never fly AA again even if it saves me money.
3128,"We travel by AA to New York every Christmas and always enjoy the journey. We travel economy class therefore no frills nevertheless it's good value the staff are kind and the food and drinks are perfectly acceptable. This year our return journey was postponed due to illness and I would like to say a huge ""thank you"" to AA for their efforts to get us back to the UK. Assistance was arranged at JFK and LHR without which we could not have managed. Excellent service and greatly appreciated."
3129,Flight AA900 EZE-MIA I traveled with my husband and we had window and alley seats but they are so very uncomfortable the leg space is almost non existent. The arm rests are very weird because that is where the entertainment control is so you put your arm on the control and it sets of constantly.
3130,My family and I traveled down from Chicago O'Hare (ORD) to Los Cabos (SJD) and back for winter break. The first flight was not good. The seats were uncomfortable and the IFE (even though it was the ceiling types) were not working. All they gave was drinks and food was way over priced. This made a 4 hour flight seem like a 9 hour flight. There were no delays or problems with check-in. On the way back we were delayed a day but that was our choice. The same plane on the way back had a faulty fuel pump and could not be fixed at Cabo. So if they were to fly the aircraft was way overweight. The pilot announced that 20 people had to leave the aircraft or everyone could fly but only 40 baggage could be kept onboard. The flight was full so that would leave at least 200 people stranded in ORD. My family had no intention to fly a 4 hour flight with a faulty fuel pump so we exited the aircraft. Plus who wouldn't want an extra day in a tropical place? American Airlines gave us one night at an all- inclusive resort on the ocean with free transportation to and from the resort. They had also booked us for the flight the next day. That was the good part. The next day the gate was crowded because they were trying to board two flights at one gate. It was a total disaster. We were delayed about 1 hour but managed to get to ORD ahead of schedule.
3131,I flew from Montreal to NYC and then form NYC to San Juan (Puerto Rico). Staff extremely nice. Planes on time. But most of all we forgot our camera on the plane and they found it and kept it for us at the luggage claim in the San Juan airport.
3132,American Airlines seriously needs to reconsider its business plan of overbooking every single flight on one day and how that affects passengers trying to make connections when one flight is late. They also need to train their employees to treat passengers with respect and provide more telephone customer service options that don't leave you waiting 45-51 minutes. My flight was 90 minutes late out of Miami and I therefore missed my connection to San Francisco and apparently every other flight was overbooked for the next 24 hours which is completely insane.
3133,Flight 3314 supposed to depart 845pm. Six gate changes rude staff. An hour and counting delay while we wait for catering truck. I hate flying American. Will use it only as last resort now.
3134,I have flown American Airlines over 60 times in 2014 without issue. I must say the customer service is much better than a couple of years ago and now with US Airways part of the family the ability to travel to about any destination you desire is there. I will continue to fly AA and with new planes new look and better customer service I will enjoy doing so.
3135,Supposed to leave Miami to Milan at 14.30 but delayed twice. In the end we left with 4 hours of delays. The plane was an old fashioned 767-300 seats were small and dirty. Entertainment was overhead screens far from our seats. A real nightmare.
3136,Flew First Class from Buenos Aires - Dallas/Ft Worth on a 777-200. The seats while dated are roomy with lots of leg room and storage space. Boarding was quick although the agents and gate security at EZE leave a bit to be desired. Our flight attendants were ok nothing remarkable. Food was filling and of fair quality. The seat is lie- angled and not super comfortable but comfy enough to relax and watch the dated IFE. I can't complain about sitting in First Class on this 11 hour flight but the whole experience was just mediocre.
3137,AA63 CDG to MIA AA931 MIA to EZE AA990 GIG to MIA AA62 MIA to CDG. Worst cabin service unimaginable seats still using the ancient TV screens on ceiling on Trans Atlantic and South American flights! Imagine looking at a small screen on top of the ceiling during a 10 hour flight. They only screen 1 movie on the entire flight.
3138,Flight from Miami to Phoenix flight 303. First class was a major disappointment from old plane to slowest service ever no pre-flight drinks and then waited over 1 hour before a beverage was served. Sorry to say the New American feels like to old AA famous for poor service. Loyal US Air at least they tried and had a sense of urgency.
3139,Round-trip from Miami to CDG Paris. Cabin seats with little to no leg space and I'm not a large person. I passed on the food on the return trip as the chicken dish on the trip from Miami to Paris was lukewarm and horrible. In recent years I have seen fares on the international flights rise rapidly and in my opinion they have done little to justify the price increase. In the future I will look for another airline.
3140,Give credit where credit is due-on the 16th of December I boarded AA193 in First seat 3E to connect in JFK to AA1416 to BDA also in First seat 3E. Due to a technical fault we had about an hour delay in BOS and I was concerned that I (and my fellow connecting passengers) would miss our connections. The captain did his best to make up time and after arriving at the gate (12) the lead flight attendant asked passengers not connecting to remain seated and let passengers with connections to disembark first. My BDA flight was at gate 40 and I made the fligh t- with moments to spare! Upon arriving in BDA was very surprised to see that my 2 bags had also made it. Thanks AA for a good team effort - and please put the dinner service back on that evening flight.
3141,Flew business SJU-JFK-LHR. SJU-JFK leg on old 757 with no individual video screens and pretty tired cabin. Food was virtually inedible. Admirals Club lounge at JFK OK but I resent having to pay for a packet of crisps when I've paid thousands for a ticket. JFK-LHR was much better: new 777 with really comfy flat bed and amazing noise cancelling headphones. Food was still awful (but food is generally dreadful in the USA anyway so to be expected. Flight slightly late but overall pretty good - particularly like the fact I wasn't woken up until 25 minutes before landing.
3142,I had about a 10 hr non stop flight from Paris to New York. There was no in seat TV. Only 2-3 TVs in the aisle and they asked for $5 each for headphones to listen to the movies they were playing of their choice. All the flight attendants were rude. I needed a blanket but they denied this. Overall it was a lesson for me to avoid American Airlines flights wherever possible.
3143,Flying from O'Hare to DC - rude attendant who let several passengers on board with 2 bags some larger than my single carry-on. I had to stow my bag because I had a shopping bag. When I offered to collapse the bag and place it under the seat I was told that I could not carry both onto the plane. Once we boarded the plane we were kept on the ground for 3 hours without water and/or food for those of us unlucky enough to not have brought our own on board. When I asked an attendant if I could have a bottle of water I was told that no service could be provided and to be patient that we would be departing soon (this was about two hours before our flight took off). When the flight eventually took off we were offered options for snacks when I requested my option I was told that they had run out. Why offer an option at all? When the drink cart eventually made its way to me I asked for a coke and was given 1/2 a coke served for me in a cup. When I asked for a second one I was told that they had limited quantities. Outdated plane with the tv screens down the middle row. Horrible service - rude check-in attendants and complete incompetence from the entire crew. I will not fly American Airlines again.
3144,Four hour fog delay from Midland to DFW. Sat on the Tarmac for a half hour to get to a gate at DFW. Then waited 45 min. on someone to open the door. Return flight was at 6.10pm - delay after delay and finally canceled at 9pm due to weather. Kicker is an AA flight left the same terminal an hour later for Midland. We couldn't schedule another flight to Midland until two days later. Agents were the rudest most disrespectful and uncaring people you would ever want to run across. If you ever desire to travel with AA don't.
3145,Flight from Chicago to Paris on Thurs (12/5/14) was nothing but miserable. AA brought two planes to the gate when neither could pass safety inspection. The big question is why the planes made it to the gate in the first place. Passengers were then told that another plane had been found (another gate) but it needed to be inspected cleaned and finally loaded - they did provide soda and pretzels during the 3.5+ hour wait (big deal). We finally boarded a not-too-clean plane (I found trash in the seat pocket) and it was cold for the entire trip. We saw the staff twice - once to serve what they call dinner and once when they served a cold breakfast. The trip was just plain awful and makes me want to give up travel by air altogether. One bright spot that has nothing to do with AA - it was a SMOOTH flight and we made it in record time due to a good tail wind.
3146,Travelled Business Class on a 777 LHR-JFK. Very impressed indeed! Cabin spotless crew helpful. Seat wider than expected and quite private. Huge amount of space and loads of storage places too - even a large wardrobe. Power points convenient (UK and US plugs both fitted). Good noise cancelling headphones. Quiet. I was in 3A which is a mini-cabin just behind First Class - I would recommend it again. AA Business class is better than BA First Class Wifi: speeds of 3-7Mb which was commendable and only £9 approx. for the whole flight - very reasonable too considering the technology costs involved. Food: ok but not special. However snack bar had loads of nice nibbles.
3147,AUS-DFW-LGA. First leg on a MD-80 old aircraft but very well maintained. Plane was spotless and the seats were comfortable especially the very plush headrest. Legroom was sufficient and flight attendants managed to a conduct a beverage service on a full flight despite a flight time of only 39 minutes. Connection at DFW was seamless. Flight to LGA on a 737-800 had the seat next to me empty which provided a more comfortable flight. Flight attendants were very young which was surprising. They were friendly and cheerful which is a nice change. Refreshments and entertainment were basic and WiFi was extremely slow. Was disappointed that I shelled out money for a slow connection that only started to speed up during descent.
3148,One way trip First Class from SFO-LAS via LAX.. First sector SFO-LAX excellent service crew couldn't do enough on this short flight. LAX-LAS complete opposite. Shame passengers had to hear how unhappy the crew were about their job.
3149,Scheduled to leave from Sacramento CA at 8am on 11/24/14. I got an automated call Sunday evening at around 11.30pm stating that my flight out of Sacramento would be delayed until 9:37AM. I was fine with this - I realize delays happen. I still arrived at the airport as if my flight were to leave at it's original 8am departure just in case. When I arrived at the American Airlines counter the women working there proceeded to tell me that because of this delay there would be no way for me to make my connection in Dallas to Montgomery. She made me feel confident that I would indeed miss my connection in Dallas. She said she had changed my flight connection in Dallas to an 9pm departure instead of the original 3.15pm flight out to Montgomery. I wasn't thrilled that I would be arriving much later but it would work. The flight from Sacramento arrived in Dallas at 2:45PM. I had thirty minutes to make my original flight. I made it with a couple minutes to spare. The women at the counter looked up my name and said I could no longer get onto this flight because my flight itinerary had been changed. I then was stuck in Dallas Airport for over 6 hours. AA staff I had talked to about my situation had any sympathy for the situation which made me even more angry. It was nothing but a speed bump into their work day. I would never recommend flying with American Airlines.
3150,"ATL - DFW flight operated on A319 aircraft. I found this flight to be comfortable (I am 5""4) and efficient. Despite the aircraft arriving 20 min later than scheduled boarding time in Atlanta flight was able to depart close to on time. Flight arrived DFW 10 min early. Cabin crew was pleasant but not overly friendly. All in all a good flight. Flight duration is only 2 hrs so not much time for entertainment and food. I would highly recommend AA domestic U.S. Flights operated on Airbus A319 aircraft vs. outdated and uncomfortable MD 80's."
3151,Manchester to New York. Their standards are poor even from arriving at the boarding gate - why split passengers into groups and then not pay attention to how those groups board the plane? Surely after business class and those with priority shouldn't the next set of passengers to board the plane be those at the rear. That process would help to ensure the plane left on time rather than almost 20 minutes late. Their fleet is old-fashioned with screens down the centre aisle which cannot be viewed from certain seats. The seats were uncomfortable - 8 hours spent in one of those is not a pleasant experience. We gained the impression that the crew and their requirements over-rode passenger considerations - clearing away too quickly before passengers had time to finish the poor quality meals having to be quiet whilst in the vicinity of sleeping staff and very few drinks/snacks being offered is not what long haul flights should be about. Even the crew's uniform was shabby.
3152,Terrible service for the money that you pay. We flew from Manchester to New York direct the inbound flight took 9 hours seats where uncomfortable they only had televisions in the aisle - no PTV and no headphones provided. Served food half an hour into the flight then left for 7 hours without anybody asking us if we needed a drink - received a smaller snack 40 mins before landing which made you feel you had to rush as they where already standing waiting for the rubbish before you had finished. The staff were unfriendly and rude. The flight home was exactly the same and to get a drink you had to walk to the back of the plane and ask yourself with more than one occasion being told they had ran out.
3153,Nov 22 AA 1520 El Salvador to Miami. AA 2487 Miami to Orlando. Will never use this airline again. Connecting flights at Miami are the worst specially international flights. They schedule connecting flights within an hour and a half apart yet they land every international flight at terminal D in Miami 5-10 mins apart. On top of all this their outbound flights are late and incoming planes have to wait to have a new gate. What is the issue with this immigration and customs are 1 hour behind making it difficult to connect. You would think the airline can have someone trying to help you get through or guide you to reconnect to another flight well that is not the case. They take their time and don't care about you.
3154,Flew from LAX to DFW DFW to Raleigh and Raleigh to LAX in August/Sept 2014. Was waiting for a bad experience based upon many reviews here but we were very happy to see all the flights were on time reasonable staff not too bad service and planes were in reasonable condition as well.
3155,"I flew DFW-LHR-DFW on AA50 and AA51. Both sectors were on a 777-300er. This is an excellent aircraft. Very spacious quiet and comfortable. AA's business class is by far the best product across the Atlantic. (Make sure that you book on the 77W. If you don't you will get the inferior 777-200 and it really isn't as good as the 300er). The fact that there is only one seat for rows A and J means that you have two windows plenty of space and lots of privacy. The lie flat bed is comfortable and easy to operate. The IFE has plenty of movies TV shows and plenty to keep you entertained. The food is very good with good choices. The walk up kitchen is kept well stocked with many tasty things. You will not go hungry on this flight! The crews were great and of course the flight deck were professional and got us to our destination safely which is always a good thing! The on board wi-fi is fantastic but please don't be a bandwidth bore and use it for ""voice"" calls like the idiot across the aisle from me did all the way to London. He was so annoying I had to complain to the flight crew to get him to shut up. AA have a great product here if they drop the 777-300er on this route as I was told they were going to do it will be a mistake. I will not fly with them. I will have to find another carrier."
3156,FLL-DFW-LAX upgrade to First. I have to admit the 737-800's are ok but need a refresh. I flew the segment from FLL-DFW it was an upgrade. OK good service. Met service manager for AA sitting next to me. She could not have been nicer. Really pleasant flight. DFW-LAX on the new Airbuses 320-B really great for the length although the seats could recline a bit more considering it is a 3 hour flight and it is hub-hub for AA. Food was OK nothing to write home about but they will upgrade that so look forward to it. No pre-flight welcome drinks - big minus. The seats - great although all leather which is a set back for AA I tend to sweat a lot and I find fabric gives you a bit more breathing. Entertainment - better than British on international flights. Large screens great selections of movies TV this is where AA is getting their game above their competition but they need to keep going. Keep changing the selection more often and staying on top of it alla Emirates. Comparable to the best though. I fly a lot including ANA JL QF BA CX and AA is on par if not above in many. Soft product needs polishing food improvement and it will start being a world-class airline again.
3157,Multiple North American flights during month including ORD-AUS AUS-DFW DFW-PBI EWR-DFW DFW-YVR YVR-DFW DFW- PBI PBI-LAX. Traveling through the US and Canada during November found me on several AA flights most in first class with upgrades a few in economy. On balance the flights were ok nothing special no notable problems. Most flights were on or close to schedule service was generally better than expected. The biggest negative is AA's equipment on these routes. All B737 or MD Super 80 aircraft. Generally confining for mid-long haul domestic and the S80s are just so old it is a wonder that AA still uses them as much as they do - not a very passenger friendly aircraft.
3158,I flew with American Airlines on October 20th this year from Dublin to JFK with my husband and two sons 12 and 9. The staff onboard that day were excellent we had the back seats just beside the staff and each one of them could not have made our flight more comfortable. Being our first flight to America and travelling with our youngest son who has autism it was quite a worry but the staff made him and us very comfortable. We are travelling back to the states in 2015 and I will make sure it is with American Airlines.
3159,What began as a simple flight from San Jose CA to New York NY (JFK) connecting at LAX has resulted in frustration and anger. Upon arriving at San Jose international airport with two hours to spare my fiancé and I each checked a bag. Our flight was projected to leave at 2.45pm PST and read 'On Time' on the departures kiosk. Without any announcement or updates our flight arrived late had to be refuelled and in turn was 30 minutes delayed. We missed our connection at LAX by five minutes and after spending far too much time in the customer service office were rebooked on a 9.30 Delta flight to JFK. Told there was no need to check-in all we would have to do is go to the gate and speak to the representative at the counter. An hour before our flight we walk to the appropriate gate only to be told that while we were listed as passengers there were no seats for us and that American should have booked seats on our behalf. We returned to the customer service office spending an hour waiting in line. An American Airlines rep took us from counter to counter trying to find us two seats on any plane. The only availability was on a place via Nashville to LaGuardia with an hour layover. As we were boarding we were pulled off the plane because he had found us a direct flight to JFK which would make finding our bags that much better. Finally arriving in JFK at 7.15 am our bags were nowhere to be found.
3160,JFK to Orlando in First. Check-in staff very helpful to our party of 6 after arrival from London. Given access to Admirals Club because long-haul had been business class. Pleasant lounge but only stayed about 20 minutes. Priority boarding and seats comfortable for a medium-length domestic flight. Captain announced that he would delay take-off whilst 35 passengers from a delayed European flight made the transfer and took off when about half that number had boarded. But the real surprise was when the flight attendant came round and said that because of the timing (early afternoon) there was no catering on the flight. Thus a 3-hour flight with just several rounds of a basket containing nuts biscuits and crisps - not a first class offering. Other than that the whole experience was much better (with arrival only slightly delayed) than I had feared given some of the reviews on here.
3161,Paid for F Class JFK-MCO via MIA. AA's JFK Terminal is beautiful. Dedicated F class check in with arrogant staff agents should be mindful of vocal tones and questions. Premium Security line ended up not being during slow time of day as TSA putting 3 non premium bodies to 1 in the same scanner line even though another was available. I purchased a day pass for the Admirals Club as I was quite early for my flight. The JFK Lounge is very nice service was good staff were very kind especially the lady at reception. Purchased a Fruit and Cheese Plate and was surprised in a happy way. Flt to MIA in a 757 intl config. with angle lie flat 2X2 seated at the window. The seats are awkward to get in/out of when upright impossible to escape a window seat with another either sitting or laying down. I tried the angle lie flat position and lasted less than 30 min. in that position simply uncomfortable might as well stand in the galley. The Lay-z-boy option of recline is very nice. PDB was offered no restrictions. Nice looking IFE pity I was never offered headsets to use it. Cocktails with nuts in a bowl served after take off then dinner. AA seems to have downgraded the nut mix with less premium nuts in the mix. The dinner was the biggest shock. The Pre ordered Lasagne was vile and the salad pathetic. Club in Miami is ok with pleasant staff. MIA-MCO in 757 Dom. config. FA's awful on this leg. Airplane broke after we boarded no one seemed to have a clue what to do next. Gate agents and Admirals Club unable to contact ops via phone for updates. No words. Next plane boarded later than promised with no reason offered. Short Flt to MCO uneventful after 2 plus hour delay. There are some things to improve at AA but there is a lot right.
3162,"Based upon our experience of American Airlines' flights from the USA to the UK several years ago and to reduce the effects of jet-lag my wife and I decided to take the daytime flight AA90 which departs Chicago (ORD) at 09.05 and arrives in London (LHR) at 22.45. In retrospect this was a mistake. The Chicago Admiral's Club lounge was most disappointing. Surprisingly no food (unless you paid for it) was available except a few sad-looking bagels and muffins. So we were hungry when the flight took off. We were seated in seats 2A & 2B (the first row on the B767-300ER aircraft) and the seats were comfortable enough with good leg room. However the aircraft was certainly showing its age. In business class (there is no first class on this flight) there are no seat-back screens and the passengers are given small tablets and Bose headphones on which to watch movies. The movie/music selection was poor and was nothing to get excited about. The food that we were served (breakfast and a pre- landing ""snack"") was probably the worst airline food we have ever experienced. It was virtually inedible and it compared extremely unfavourably with the food that we were served in British Airways business class on our flight to the USA three weeks earlier. Furthermore the cabin attendants were virtually invisible. On the eight-hour flight I was never once offered tea or coffee - all I was given was a bottle of water to drink. Two hours before the flight landed in London I had to find a flight attendant and ask for a Bacardi and Coke - no flight attendant ever asked me if I would like something to drink. Unlike British Airways business class on our American Airlines flight we could see no sign of a basket in the kitchen area containing anything to snack on (like bars and sweets). American Airlines do you think that this is acceptable? Just what are business class passengers paying several thousand dollars/pounds over the economy fare for? (You do not arrive any earlier than the people sitting in the back). The food and service we experienced on our flight from ORD to LHR were completely unacceptable and based on our recent experience fear that it will be a very long time before we fly on American Airlines in business class again."
3163,My wife and I flew from San Jose (SJC) to Chicago (ORD) on AA1530 in first class. San Jose is certainly a very pleasant little airport but unfortunately there is no American Airlines Admiral's Club room for first and business passengers. Our seats on the aircraft (3A & 3B - the first row of seats on the B737-800) were fairly comfortable and there was enough leg room. We had pre-ordered our meal on-line and it was described as miso chicken. Our meals although nicely served were of very poor quality so much so that my wife refused to eat any more after the first few mouthfuls. The flight attendant who looked after us was pleasant. courteous and helpful. But the three-hour flight as far as we were concerned was spoilt by food of very poor quality - not what you expect when you are travelling first class.
3164,DFW to LHR on new 777-300. Although American has updated their fleet and now have a business class seat that competes with most European carriers they really need to improve the service standard and the selection of their cabin personnel. Flight attendants were in a hurry to finish service and rude the quality of food just average and the presentation and amenities nothing remarkable. There was not the feeling of being in Business class on this flight.
3165,"LAX-Las Vegas (Return). Given its only a 40 minutes flight each way - not much can go wrong. The Flagship lounge at LAX was fine. Above expectations. Decent food and beverages. Spacious and quiet- and one I'd recommend. Flight both ways was on a brand new (you could ""smell"" it was brand new) on an A321 - a plane I'd not heard of - but apparently the ""new"" big brother to the A320. Great plane - in fact I'd say superb. Nice roomy first class that I'd be happy with on a 3-4 hour hour flight. Nice FAs. Plane both ways was rammed from end to end. Both flights left on time and landed ahead of schedule. What was noticeable was the gloomy faces on the return; assume this was down to losing to many dollars at the casinos - rather than the AA experience. All in all - a good experience."
3166,AA 262 B737 RSW to DFW 1st November 2014 good flight in First Class comfortable seat food surprisingly good for short flight no personal IFE seat not as good as US Airways A320.
3167,AA 50 DFW to LHR 777-300 1st November 2014. New Business class seating 3A beats BA's Club World product hands down IFE excellent Food OK - welcome drink in plastic cup. Overall would always look at AA's Business product if it was the new one over BA.
3168,I flew American for the first time today and will never fly with them again. My entire experience was horrible. My flight was delayed for 2 hours causing me to miss my connecting flight. So in addition to having already spent my whole morning in an airport I had to have my second flight rescheduled which cost me an additional 2 hours of wait time. Then my second flight is delayed 30 minutes because according to the pilot they hadn't removed the Jetway tunnel. Finally I arrive at my destination only to be informed that my luggage ended up on a different flight from mine and that I would have to wait an additional hour and a half before that flight arrived. Never using them again.
3169,We flew AA from Minneapolis to Chicago (ORD) to NY (LGA) - JFK to Paris (CDG) and MIA to MSP. After reading many bad reviews I though I would say that we had no bad experiences at all. we were given an exit row seat on our JFK-Paris flight. The food was normal airline food not great but I enjoyed the meals. I am 6 ft 2 and I had enough room on all my flights. The service was pleasant. The onboard entertainment was lacking on the 767 to Paris but I slept so it did not bother me.
3170,Manchester to Florida via Chicago. I had no real issue with the internal flights to Chicago but have a number of issues with the long haul flight to Chicago. The seats were in no way suitable very little leg room and I can imagine that it was very awkward if you didn't know the person sitting either side of you. The food wasn't too bad on the way out but if you suffered any dietary requirements it was tough. The flight ran out of certain drinks outbound and on the return journey. On the return journey we were sat at the back and we had to settle for what was left food wise as they'd run out of one of the options. The majority of the attendants were either rude sarcastic and had obviously missed the training session on customer service. Inflight entertainment was poor AA seem to be stuck in the dark ages with one tiny screen for every few seats. Overall I was very disappointed with the service which made a long flight seem even longer. I've definitely been spoilt with Virgin Atlantic who I will be using from now on.
3171,We always travel First class where available as we appreciate the extra details. We booked our family vacation first class from LAX to Maui on AA after a four day stop over in Disneyland. We had an early morning ride to the airport from Disneyland and check in went smoothly. The agent directed us to priority screening and The Admiral Lounge to relax in while waiting for our flight. Once we got to the lounge they tried to charge us $50 per person for lounge access. Normally with a first class ticket lounge access is part of that cost on all the other airlines we travel with. Not with American Airlines. They just chipped away at customer value by that one action for our family and I would recommend not using them if possible.
3172,Flew New York to Las Vegas - October 22nd flight #45. I´m really surprised that American is not considered Low Cost. First you must do your own check in and pay $25 for your first luggage. Second you have to paid extra if you want a comfortable seat. I paid $59 to stretch my legs and I choose the first row after business class. There was a division panel so in fact there wasn't much room. Third in 5 hours flight only 1 complimentary drink and if you want food have to pay for it. Fourth They promote the internet onboard but this is not free $4 for email and more if you want to surf the net. The flight boarded with 1 hour and half delay due to a problem with a luggage compartment door. Seated onboard for another hour and then half an hour waiting for our turn to take off after leaving the gate.
3173,"LHR-LAX. I bought the First Class fare to Las Vegas via LAX as it was quite good value for money and I knew I would be getting AAs new First Class product on the 777-300ER - it was certainly a better bet than BAs Club World on an ageing 747 - the only alternative. I avoided the AA Flagship lounge at LHR T3 as I had read so many bad reviews. The BA alternative was okay. The plane was brand new and the new seat was fine. There are only 8 seats in the AA 1st Class on this plane. Nothing spectacular. It was roomy good TV good seat controls and a neat feature was the rotation to face out of the window. Food was well just okay. Nothing very stylish. A trout timbale to start. A nice spicey butternut squash soup came next. Boring salad - seen better in M&S. Chicken main was - well okay. Had better in my local pub. FAs were friendly and called passengers by name. For the money it was acceptable. Certainly not worth $10-12000+ return which is often the regular list price to LAX. It lacks the ""class"" wow factor which should be obvious when you fly in first."
3174,"LHR-ORD return I have come to the conclusion that AA are probably the worst Airline I have flown with. First of all the planes wouldn't look out of place in a museum I haven't seen such an antiquated IFE system since the 1990's - suspended CRT monitors and they have the gall to charge nearly $6 a head for headphones. The food is awful with no choice to speak of - breakfast on both flights was a choice between omelette or scrambled egg since my daughter will not eat egg dishes on the outbound flight we asked if they could provide an alternative were curtly told we should have ordered a special diet meal. On the return flight we upset the crew by taking my daughters breakfast on board with us. The final meal - no choice just pizza. On both flights it was served so late that no sooner had we opened our cutlery than we were begin badgered by give up our trays as the crew needed to prepare for landing. During the outbound flight having slept for four hours and with no response to the call button I walked back to the galley to request a drink for myself and my family only to be told ""You have run us all ragged on this flight so we have closed up the galley and are resting so you'll have to wait for the meal""."
3175,Used American on four flights SFO-LAX-MCO and TPA-MIA-LAX a mix of 738-800s 757 & A321. Despite losing a bag and a 2hr delay which where handled very well all flights were fine with nice crew seating and PTV on the A321. They don't serve food in economy on internal flights and I realise they are not SQ or CX but for the price I paid they are fine. I was able to use the lounge and book MCE seats because of my Oneworld status which made a little difference. My only complaint is compared to other Oneworld alliance members there lounges are miles away from either BA or CX.
3176,First time I flew American (I usually fly Delta) and I must say that overall I was impressed with the airline. On the way to NYC we departed on time and even got there 30 min early (never has happened to me before). The staff were helpful and the efficiency of the service was a huge plus to me. On the way back to Detroit we did board a bit late and sit on the runway for a while but again was a quick flight and really not much that I can complain about. Would recommend American Airlines.
3177,San Diego to Miami - seating was so tight I couldn't read a magazine when the seat in front of me reclined. Extra charges for everything. A truly horrible experience but it was non-stop and they were punctual.
3178,Never again. We booked to travel from Manchester to Orlando. The aircraft in both directions was old cramped and uncomfortable. The temperature of the cabin was inconsistent. The entertainment was rubbish no seat back TVs which have always been a standard for all international flights that we have travelled on. The aisle TVs could not be seen from window seats which was pointless and dark sections of the movie could not be seen at all. Food was terrible my salad arrived uncovered and food was average. Ground crew were frantically trying to get people to give up seats flight was overbooked with many families not sitting together and children split from their parents on the flight! AA was not much cheaper than my other flight options. Avoid travelling with them!
3179,My husband and I have just flown with AA from LHR to MIA and back and was very disappointed at the poor service and the rude and off hand attitude of the cabin staff in economy. As former Cabin crew myself I was astonished at the poor and lack of service on board. On the outbound flight there was no service for over 2.5 hrs as turbulence was expected. There was no attempt at any service during this time and the meal and drink were almost flung at us. I don't recall being offered a hot drink! No more service until the snack service which was an undercooked pizza. Pretty basic for a 9 hr day flight the return flight was no better. No drinks were served with breakfast as more turbulence was expected! There was no turbulence - in my opinion the crew didn't leave themselves enough time to carry out a full service. Considering the cost of the flight and the other ways airlines have of extracting money from pax such as priority boarding and choosing seats etc I expected better service and at least some courtesy! We felt that the service we received was unsatisfactory. I will not be recommending American Airlines after our disappointing experience.
3180,LAX to ORD via St. Louis one way in first. Both flights on time. Food was very good. Staff was very professional. All in all a very nice experience. Not much entertainment wise but these flights are not that long.
3181,AA is an embarrassment to US hospitality and service. I frequently fly business class transatlantic - have you tried to get past a neighbor who is lying flat to reach the aisle? It's almost impossible as the seats are so badly positioned and designed. And what about the Business lounge H at Heathrow the food available and decor are awful compared to any other major world airline - yes including some US competitors. Finally I am tired of the grumpy geriatric flight attendants that seem to dominate the ranks. All US airlines have lost ground compared to their European peers but AA is down at the bottom of the pile.
3182,Awful experience. The cabin crew are amongst the rudest least helpful people you are likely to come across in life. I was travelling with two small children 2years and 8months. Having spent the majority of the flight on my feet rocking my 8mth old to sleep she finally fell asleep. Breakfast arrived unfortunately I knocked the tray onto the floor. The member of cabin crew stepped over it ignoring it. When I apologised and asked for help to pick it up he curtly said he would get it later. The breakfast was strewn all over the floor in front of the toilet. I had a sleeping baby in my arms. When another passenger woke up half an hour later my fellow passenger was kind enough to pick the items up.
3183,My wife and I travelled overnight to Rome on AA on Oct. 1 from JFK. It was very disappointing. There were no in seat videos on the Boeing 767. The overhead screens continued to play movies until just before landing which prevented me form sleeping. The economy section food was uninspiring to say the least with stale dinner rolls and a wedge of cheese for dessert. This is our last international trip on AA.
3184,This was my first and last time with American Airlines. Booked with British Airways from Dublin to Orlando. Flight out was fine as it was with BA but return was with AA - as they are partners of BA I thought the service would be the same. How wrong I was - flight was 2.5 hours delayed which meant we missed our flight from Dublin to Glasgow. I had to pay £190 to rebook flights. We were only allowed 1 checked bag each but with BA we were allowed 2 each. The stewardesses only came round once with drinks service and you had to pay for spirits. Plane seemed old. No inflight entertainment system in the back of seat instead TVs that came down where everyone had to watch the same film. No leg room at all. Very narrow seats that were extremely uncomfortable. I never complain about anything and when I read the reviews before our flight I thought they were exaggerated but honestly it's the worst flight I have ever been on and I wouldn't fly with them again even if it was free.
3185,I flew from CDG to JFK on October 14th. It was the cheapest direct flight which was quite punctual. So the basis is 100% fulfilled. But the overhead compartment opened during take off and things fell down. It reopened during landing. When I left the plane I said it to the steward he did not ask me where it was located. Just something common. In addition to this half of the flight was in the dark because of an electric malfunction that prevented us calling for assistance. That is the visible part of the aircraft for the passenger. To fly in an old plane ok but it has to be nicely maintained.
3186,Always delays even when the plane is the first one out in the morning. Frequently when there are going to be weather delays the airline won't cancel so you can make alternative arrangement until you have sat all day waiting. I fly frequently and American always has some excuse for why they can't help their delays. Sick of this airline.
3187,"I was flying from Miami - Sao Paulo on AA929 on the 10th July 2014 on a 772ER in First. Having arrived from LAX 2 hours prior I was absolutely exhausted and was hoping to get some sleep on this leg. Boarding was smooth and the flight took off on time once the aircraft had reached cruising altitude and the seat belt sign was turned off I made my way to the galley and requested one of the two FA's (both were busy discussing their personal problems rather then attending to passengers) to turn down my bed I received a shocking impertinent response from her: ""So you want me to push a button for you"". Disgruntled and furious I prepared the bed myself and slept for the remainder of the flight. Around an hour before landing I was poked and woken up by the same rude flight attendant. At that point I expressed my frustration and told her she was not fit for purpose and shouldn't be working customer service orientated role. American Airlines has a good product in First (for a North American airline) I managed to sleep comfortably; however their poorly trained rude staff make it an unpleasant experience. Upon completing my flight I cancelled my return with AA and subsequently purchased a new flight with TAM which has a far superior product and customer service it's a shame they're suspending their first class on all routes from early next year."
3188,October 9 2014 AA 137 DFW to HKG. Flight departed Dallas pretty much on time. Once airborne hot paper towels were distributed following by drink service. Complimentary beers and wine. Shortly after drink service lunch was served followed by another round of drink service. Special vegetarian meal was provided. Meal consisted of rice and chick peas curry with a side salad with olive oil dressing and two pieces of melon as desert. Tiny quantity but tasted decent and edible. About 7 or 8 hours into the flight a mid flight snack was served with drinks. Three pieces of vegetarian wraps and a fruit salad was served. Less than two hours before landing in Hong Kong another meal was served. This time the meal was a cold pasta salad with two pieces of cantaloupe melon. Flight was about a little over 16 hours. Seats in Main Cabin Extra were fairly comfortable. Flight crew was professional but lack the grace of Asian carriers flight crew. No other amenities were provided like other Asian carriers such as toothbrush socks eye masks etc. However a refreshments self service counter was set up in the galley and juices and water were available through out the flight. IFE was surprisingly good with many new movies and TV shows available on demand. No flight deck announcement but flight crew provided information in English Cantonese and Mandarin. All in all a satisfactory flight with inexpensive fare compared to Cathay Pacific or Singapore Airlines but nothing special. Flight crew did not attempt to make passengers feel particularly welcome nor rude to passengers. Better than expected.
3189,I recently flew from Chicago to Dublin Ireland on American Airlines - never again. The planes on both legs were filthy the toilets stank there was no individual IFE only shared screens on a 8.5 hour transatlantic flight the cabin crew were the rudest most unfriendly people I have ever met everybody sitting around me agreed. People had asked for blankets etc. but never got them. And to add insult to injury we were delayed 2.5 hours out of Dublin the crew didn't apologize and hit and the back so as to not have to deal with the passengers. If traveling from Chicago to Dublin I highly recommend either Aer Lingus or United. Both have good IFE their planes are clean and their staff are pleasant and accommodating. American Airlines in my opinion has gone downhill despite all their promises of improving their planes and services.
3190,Flew with AA Flight 734 Miami to Philadelphia to connect to Manchester on 30th September. The outbound flights both with US Airways. AA refused point bank to help me book the seats for 734 when I rang the UK customer services. Both agents need a training course last one told me to arrange seats at airport. US Airways helped me with seats for my family on their 3 legs. I tried to log in to my flight the night before to book seats to together and found to my horror there were no seats together and I had no choice but to choose from the few left. Arrived at Miami and flight was showing on time. Shortly before take off it became a 30 minute delay. Many people waiting concerned as they had connections like us. Some had no boarding passes for their US airways flight as they could not print these on check in. Unhelpful lady at desk would not help meaning those without passes then had to go chasing around PHL airport to get passes printed. Flight landed 30 minutes late cue rush as the plane was packed and most had connections to make. We were lucky as our flight departed from Terminal A. Still it left no time to go to any shops or buy food and drink. For their abysmal customer service for refusing to help me but worse by far for the first time in my life having my entire family split up on a plane and having to sit with total strangers I will boycott AA. US Airways in contrast were very good and helpful. Goodbye AA they just don't seem to care anymore. Had to give 1 star for entertainment. Should be a 0 option as unless you pay you get nothing! Wifi? Oh yes pay for that as well!
3191,October 6th 2014 MIA-STT. American Airlines is a low budget airline at best with premium airline prices. The service that American Airlines provide is on par with Spirit Airlines and Ryanair. Why pay so much to get there when someone else gets you there for less with same level of service.
3192,I have not flown for a long time but I must say I was very disappointed. I took a trip from Tampa Florida to Boston MA and twice fights were delayed. It's a shock to me that airlines charge so much to fly and then your experience is so poor. In this day and age delays should not be happening for this amount of time. I cannot consider them again.
3193,I took a flight from Phoenix to Miami with Nassau Bahamas my final destination. I was extremely disappointed in the first class service. On a 3.5 hour flight we were offered one glass of either wine or water and twice a snack. Granted it was a red eye flight regardless the service should have at least offered a breakfast and coffee/tea. We landed at 7.30 Miami time which is long past morning coffee. This is the second time I took this flight and won't travel it again.
3194,Flew from Manchester to New York and it was by far the worst airline I've ever flown with. Old tired plane with aisle screens - shocking when flying international. I couldn't even listen to the film as something had broken off inside where I was meant to plug in my earphones. The flight attendants response? 'Oh I'm not sure what I can do about that.' Disgusting customer service. The so called 'entertainment' consisted of 1 film then American programmes that I've never even heard of then it was turned off altogether 2 hours before we landed! The staff were very abrupt and just looked fed up - the food was hands down the worst I've ever had on a flight.
3195,This is the first time in about 15 years that I have flown AA. Never again! This airline doesn't care about customer service. Our flight out of DFW was delayed 4.5 hrs. Never was there an announcement. The gate changed 5 times. The flight being delayed was never addressed. DFW airport at AA is absolutely awful. While sitting for 5 hours and speaking to other passengers we found out the majority of flights were delayed for some reason or other. There were few if any gate representatives around. Nothing was explained to anyone.
3196,Round-trip Toronto to Dallas Sep 29 - 30. New A319 on both segments - aircraft clean and shiny. Paid for premium seat and well worth the $80 for the round trip. Lots of leg room exit row on return segment. AVOD and AC power available to all seats. Perhaps it's the new hardware making everyone happier - cabin crew was polite and friendly on both legs in contrast to several other AA flights in recent years.
3197,Traveled with AA MIA to SFO and return. Oct 1st and 5th. 738 on the first leg. 5.5 hr min flight one beverage service offered. Return flight 757 and 2 beverage services offered. Pay extra for better cabin seats pay to check a bag and hardly a smile. Really felt like cattle and not a pleasant experience. Waited for one hour to receive bags on the return arrival in Miami. It is truly a shame to see the deterioration of service in the industry and the total lack of customer care.
3198,Over crowded flight. They actually overbooked. Had 2 hour delay and another hour delay on the connecting flight. Had to literally run to the connecting gate due to such a late arrival the gates were very far apart. Plane was filthy. I don't think they clean them ever. Seats are small and uncomfortable. Can't even fully open the tray tables. I'm not a large person and I was unable to do it so I'm sure large people can't use them at all. However they do have tablets built into the seats but you can't do much on them unless you pay a high fee. Will not fly with American Airline again.
3199,My Wife and I flew 28th Sept Vancouver to DFW to Orlando Business/First. Breakfast omelette cold sent back asked for a second warm scone instead! We were not the only pax to send the cold omelettes back. Admiral Club in DFW refused us entry. Never refused entry into Airline lounges before showing First/Business class tickets? My Priority Pas came to the rescue allowing me entry into a different lounge at DFW. The staff seemed very disinterested in what was going on and this includes a non existent cabin check prior to landing at Orlando. Will never waste my Dollars on First/Business on American domestic flights in the future. Nearly forgot - had to pay for wi-fi!
3200,"Original flight was from LGA to DFW. After flying in circles in the air for half an hour we finally re-routed to land in Little Rock Arkansas. We sat on the runway in the plane for at least two hours with no offerings of good or water even after the 4 hour flight. I understand completely this is weather related and only looking out for our safety however this was not handled well at all. When asking the stewardess for water- it's like it was a huge inconvenience. We finally deboard the plane in Arkansas and were told to wait around to see if the flight is officially cancelled - an hour later it was. Hotel rooms were not offered to be paid for not even a meal or anything at all. Everyone paid out of pocket and waited to de board the next morning. Back at the airport at 6am and we were told to use our old boarding passes and go directly to security- they refused us and made is wait back in the long American Airlines line to get a new boarding pass. My final destination was Austin which was also cancelled. They put me on a flight to Houston in first class which was unexpected. However I decided to just rent a car and drive to Austin from Dallas but I was told that there was no possible way to get my bag because it was listed as priority to Houston. Well our flight from Arkansas to Dallas was delayed an hour then the flight from Dallas to Houston was delayed another hour. First class wasn't anything special honestly more leg room and drinks served in glass instead of plastic. Finally arrive in Houston waiting at baggage claim and guess what - my bag isn't there. I was told it was on the next flight coming in from Dallas which infuriated me after I wanted to originally take my bag in Dallas as it was. Waited around the airport for another hour or so and finally get my bag with a big orange sticker on it saying ""priority"". Yeah right. Never will fly American again."
3201,JFK-LAX First class. Good but not overwhelming as it should be. Seat on A321 is good but has some problems very hard to get out or in while even partly reclined. Food was mediocre in quality although presented nicely. Flight crew was wonderful but honestly the whole experience is either over priced or under done. Jet Blue Mint on my outbound was much better.
3202,Travelled for work to Santa Fe from Washington Dulles via Dallas Fort Worth. All the planes were on time and clean. No entertainment offered in MD80 old planes they should retire them. Everything on sale including headphones for $5 and you can take home after use. My company paid $1100 for this economy class ticket which is probably worth $300. Staff was all very friendly and offered whatever they can so acceptable behaviour there.
3203,Last night I flew from O'Hare to Dublin Ireland with American Airlines. I am a seasoned transatlantic traveler and have flown all airlines from North American to either Shannon or Dublin Ireland. On boarding the 767-200 aircraft I was astonished that there was no AVOD on the place only the large overhead screens which went out 15 years ago. Everybody sitting around me was annoyed as we all had to watch the same movies for the 7.5 hour flight. It is probably going to be the same on the 8.5 return flight - never again American Airlines.
3204,"AA104 JFK-LHR 20 Sept - Long queues at ""Priority"" Check-in at Kennedy thirty minute wait as agents struggled to help passengers from strike-bound Air France. TSA security a shambles (not the airlines fault). Admiral's Club a little crowded but a haven. Greeted by smilingly efficient desk staff. Bartender knew the drill two stiff Grey Goose and Tonics swiftly dispensed (but cheap and nasty plastic glasses?) Boarding was smooth and quick cabin crew a tad overwhelmed trying to stow overhead bins on this full to bursting flight. Main Cabin Extra (19D) seat would be well worth the small surcharge but complimentary to Ruby and above frequent flyers anyway. Great IFE OK food dished out promptly after take-off. Croissant juice and coffee before early Heathrow arrival. Bags already delivered by the time I got to the belt. From being the third world poor relation of the Oneworld Alliance American seem to be vastly improved; new aircraft and good service at an excellent price. My next transatlantic trip with them (to Chicago in November) is on a 767 with a retro 25 year old cabin fit though - watch this space."
3205,Recently flew DUB-ORD - 22 year old 767 ORD-LAX-SFO 737's SFO-LAX-LHR 737 and new 777. Apart from the fact that I got there and back safely I must say what a disappointment the airline is in terms of inflight entertainment comfort staff and food/drinks. I fly regularly from the UK mainly East on EU/Asian airlines or within Europe and I now realise how spoilt we are here. When comparing AA to QR EK etc they just do not compare in any regard. The old 767 aircraft in a very tired state still had analogue buttons for their armrest music entertainment system and huge drop down crt displays. Food was awful and very poor quality on takeoff. The pre-landing snack a deep dish pizza was much better albeit on the greasy side. Domestic US services were on 737's - one with the new sky interior and 2 older interiors. All perfectly fine to get me from point A to B. Plenty of rather expensive food purchase options in the terminals and ability to bring food on board was good. I did not think much of the in- flight food menu for purchase - limited choice and not great quality it would seem. Nice touch for in-flight wi-fi although I didn't use it. The biggest disappointment and a real embarrassment was the supposed 'flagship American service' from LAX-LHR. Super cramped seating in 10 abreast layout in economy meant no elbow room whatsoever. Very poor in-flight entertainment system - hard to navigate difficult to find music titles plus generally limited selection. The catering was shockingly poor for dinner a chicken dish which was flavourless and served with a salad with grated cheese and dressing some crackers with cheese spread a biscuit for dessert and a cold and chewy roll. Breakfast was similarly disappointing and consisted of a yoghurt orange juice and a horrible leathery croissant served with jam and butter. A continental breakfast on a service between the states and the UK? Where is the sausage and eggs? Even Qatar give the above and a hot dish as their breakfast in better quality. The embarrassment really comes with the announcement at the start of the flight where we are introduced and welcomed to their 'flagship' service. It is laughable. On a plus note the drinks service was perfect. Crew were very hit and miss on all sectors. 767 is way above the 777 in terms of comfort and space. I would much rather have 9 abreast in a 777 or a 22 year old 767 then this flagship 777. Good USB/power options though - that's probably the only thing that they got right on AA136. I would go out of my way to avoid AA in future unless price is the only factor.
3206,AA #202 LAX/BOS in First Class Sept 28. On time both ends old first class. Crew worked very hard with drinks Samsung tablets and then lunch. Seemed a bit hectic but the galley space is close to seating. Tablets require a lot of the crew but are fine to use with good selection easy controls and good definition. Lunch was respectable and crew remained available throughout the flight for drink refills and distribution of snack before landing. A good experience with obvious efforts made to live up to advertised quality.
3207,Manchester to Las Vegas via Chicago. I currently live in Dubai and travel quite frequently using Emirates so I have probably been spoilt. The planes we flew on with American from the outside looked very modern however once we boarded things were very different. The interiors were outdated and looked like they had been in use since the 70's the interior was dull and the seats were like something out of a scrap yard mine was actually broken from were the trolleys had banged into it coming down the aisles. None of the economy seats had single televisions which I just could not believe for a long haul flight! Only business class are given portable tablets to watch the entertainment. The food was very poor and tasteless and the flight crew were bickering between themselves from take off to landing. I was extremely disappointed with this airline and I have vowed never to fly with them again please be warned as we spent a lot of money on this holiday only to be left disappointed by this carrier.
3208,AA101 LHR/JFK 10Sept. Efficient and friendly One World priority check-in. Comfortable Admiral's Club - breakfast baked goods decent coffee. Smooth boarding onto fresh-from-the-factory Boeing 777. 19D in Main Cabin Extra - more legroom 9 abreast config (10 across in the main cabin). On-time departure. Excellent communication from flight- deck. Top class entertainment (but take your own headphones) IFE can be viewed from gate to gate. Good cabin service - food and drink could be better. Complimentary beer and foul wine on offer. Half an hour ahead of schedule at New York. Plenty of agents staffing passport control. Prompt baggage delivery. Good flight at bargain basement fare - well done!
3209,Travelled last week from Vancouver to Lima via Dallas on a paid business class fare. Entire experience was a huge disappointment the flight crews were indifferent seats were uncomfortable especially in the 757's from DFW to Lima. Did not get my pre ordered meal on the Lima - DFW return. As a business class passenger the Admirals Club at DFW was underwhelming. Had to pay for water. Will travel any other airline unless there is no other option. What a horrible product.
3210,Flights r/t SFO-JFK in the new A321 in C SFO-JFK and F on the return. First the F flight was simply the best domestic flight I have experienced in at least a decade. The new F seat is essentially the same as CX uses for long haul business a lie flat seat which is entirely private. The IFE screen is huge and the selection of movies is vast. Service was superb and attentive. The food was the best domestic food I have had for a decade (of course nothing will bring back the old days of caviar and meat carved on a trolley from the old days). The outbound C experience was excellent. Seat very comfortable and spacious. Service was good and meal acceptable. Should add it is a pleasure to fly on a brand new aircraft.
3211,I flew with American Airline from CDG to NYC and was outraged by the aircraft used a 757 with a very uncomfortable Biz Class old seats and basically an outdated aircraft. The inflight service was just OK and it is far from the standards used by American when flying to Asia. On the return trip it was a 767 and the experience was as awful as the way in. There is no comparable Biz Class in any Major European airlines American should rethink their product and services approach on these routes. Pathetic!
3212,Fight #1636 from Miami to Washington DC on Friday September 24 delayed for an hour due to the problem in Chicago then sat for 1.5 hrs inside the plane with no AC due to a maintenance issue. Typical of this airline - being treated like cattle.
3213,I flew on 23rd Sept.2014 on AA291 from Dublin to New York and after over 30 years flying with American I can say the airline is in deep trouble the staff obviously did not care about the passengers and if that is what happens in business class I feel sorry for economy class which is a cattle truck anyway. No water offered no wine offered no announcement about baggage pick-up at JFK. You had to ask for everything and the body language was why are you bothering us.
3214,I had to take my parents to the airport today to fly from SEA to JFK. We were on Alaskan Airlines flight powered by American Airlines. They were early to the airport for check-in at Alaska but got directed to go to American Airlines because for some reason we needed to check in there. The Alaskan Airlines employees were very cheerful and eager to help. Then when we showed up to American Airlines we were not even able to check-in even though they had 43 minutes before takeoff. They were 2 minutes late for automated check in. Then they had to wait in another line which gave them another flight which added an extra stop in Dallas. This changed their travel time from 5.5 hrs originally to a 9 hr journey. We had to accept even though we tried to plead them to get them on the original flight. The terrible thing is that they got to their standby gate 15 minutes earlier than the original flight was going to take off. And by no means are my parents fast people even with the normal lines in TSA. They could have made their original flight! I will never do third party travel sites again and the stupid confusion on flights was terrible.
3215,Flew this week Austin to Boston via DFW. Coach on the way up First on the return. Always impressed with the AUS- DFW flights even in coach they still serve the always full 124 pax a beverage on a 35 minute flight. MD-80 to DFW Main Cabin Extra as always comfortable and once again beverage service. B738 in Main Cabin Extra to Boston seats were fine the plane was clean the coach flight attendants on this route were somewhat disinterested. Only one beverage service and offer for food on a 4 hour flight. B757 with old interior on return. Didn't know any plans with these seats still existed. I did forget how large the seats are. Old seats but still comfortable. The two First Class flight attendants on this 4 hour leg were fantastic. Excellent service good red wine with dinner and a (4) course meal including a smoked salmon appetizer. Great food great service as always. Terminal C Admirals Club was a nice rest spot for our 90 minute lay over. MD-80 in First on the short 32 minute trip to Austin. Still a nice drink in their new glassware with Malano cookies out of the snack basket. AA still excels any other domestic carrier with regards to food offerings and beverage service especially in coach.
3216,Flew last month business class JFK-CDG. Flight delayed almost 4 hours announced 1 hour prior to departure. The attendant in the lounge told me we were lucky we had a plane. After boarding I was told the seat was not operational there was a barely visible sticker. But they did not know to what degree. The pilot had to look it up in his log. This took some 30 minutes. Verdict seat does not recline at all! They moved me to the back an arms reach from the coach bathroom. Each time someone went in and came out door slamming flash of light. There were 2 other much more desirable seats 4 AB it turned out those were for the staff. AA knows this are undesirable seats and it does not book them for their employees. The service on AA compared to other airlines is pitiful. With a few exceptions they treat you like they are doing you a favor. You never see a smile. The food most of the time is just plain bad. Due to the delay I almost missed my connection. After arriving to my final destination I found out that my luggage did not make it they found it 2 days later. Due to having to file paperwork for the missing luggage I missed my connection. AA is trying to blame it on the other airline.
3217,AA #2251 BOS/DFW on 9/8/2014 in first class. Flight left and landed on time. Seats comfortable though not the new lie flat. No seat AVOD. But the service the lunch were fine. Lots of refills for drinks updates from the flight deck. Connecting at DFW to Qantas to Sydney and transfer of luggage at DFW successful. A happy experience all in all.
3218,Miami - Los Angeles. Booked the tickets in advance so the cost of travelling first class for a near 6 hour trip was good value against the price charged for economy. Check in quick and we boarded on time with no delays. The crew were excellent attentive without being intrusive used our names when asking what we would like to drink and all made us all feel welcome on board. The food was very palatable. IFE was limited to drop down screens as the aircraft whilst scheduled to be one of the newer A321s in two class configuration was swapped out for an older 737 still wearing the old AA livery hence the 2 stars for IFE. Overall a very positive experience with AA on this flight.
3219,This is my first and last time to fly AA. Booked my vacation 6 months in advanced for Sunday to Sunday in the Dominican Republic. Arrived on Sunday morning to find out AA switched our flight to their sister company US Airways. Went to US airways to check in and they had no record of the switch. Went back to AA and after a search located our reservation. However this took so long that we missed our flight and they didn't have anything else going out on that day. They rebooked us for Monday morning and tried fixing it with $200 voucher (my non refundable room was $300 plus missing a day of vacation). On Monday morning (5.15 am flight) we showed up and checked in and got on the plane it is now 6.15 am and we are still sitting at the gate because an exterior light is out. You would thing they could have fixed it overnight. Anyway no matter how the rest of the flight goes they can't change my mind about the low scores on this review.
3220,Great flight from JFK back to LA. Great service that was friendly and professional. The new airbus was polished and the cabin smart. I actually got four hours sleep on the new flatbed. Pre drinks meal service and the cookie and milk prior to landing was super nice and very much felt like service on there international routes when AA is on point. I have had nightmare crew on international flights like many reviewers have mentioned but AA really has made a substantial effort to compete on the NYC/LA route. Will fly them again and maybe try there first class product.
3221,I was scheduled to leave on Thursday at 3:05 PM (august 28 2014). I was called by American and notified that my flight was delayed out of San Diego so my connections would be missed. American then rescheduled me for a flight the following day at 8:30pm (over 29 hours after the departure date I had scheduled). I then called American and got them to put me on the original flight that was delayed and move my connecting flights. My plan was to just sleep in Chicago and fly from Chicago to London and London to Nice the following day. After taking the original delayed flight I got a hotel in Chicago for 200$ because the flight out the next day was not until 5:05pm. 5 hour delay on the flight from Chicago to London - over 2 hours were on-board sitting at the gate. I missed the connection from London to Nice and they put me on another flight which was also delayed 1 hour. I finally arrived in Nice over 24 hours later than the ticket I purchased. On the way back to San Diego everything went smoothly except my luggage did not make one of my connections. I finally got them to deliver the bag 56 hours after I landed.
3222,Most frustrating travel experience traveled from DC to Honolulu trip planned paid for fewer stops and earlier arrival leaving DCA boarded plane on time then proceeded to sit on a boarded full plane for 1.5 hours because there was an overlooked routine mechanical issue preventing the plane from regulating the cabin temperature. Missed connection gave me a ticket including two stops and no talk of partial refund just a condescending align. Fast forward 1 week and again we're delayed by 2hrs in Honolulu. If you value your time do not fly American airlines.
3223,"I don't fly with American Airlines much anymore but I flew them to Seattle for Thanksgiving so flights were busy. I was in the very last row (row 32) of an MD-80 - it was noisy back there. My aunt was carrying our babies car seat which had food inside it it dropped into the first class aisle and one of the FA's glared at us and said ""you're dropping food!"" I mean really and she didn't even offer to help carry it? Fortunately a courteous passenger came and helped. Flight Attendant in coach was a lot nicer she even gave us some food for free after she saw how stressed we were. Then the return flight was cancelled because they could not get the hangar door open so American Airlines gave us some Hotel Vouchers. After getting back to the airport American Airlines gave us seats in First Class to make up for the bad night we had free food with larger seats and more legroom was ok but it was just not enough. We were tired and wanted to get home after landing back in Charlotte we had to deal with riding a packed bus to get back to the Long Term parking lot. This was the most tiring trip I have ever had for a domestic flight."
3224,"9/10 from West Palm Beach to SNA 2.35pm connection in Chicago missed the 5.10 connection. Flight was delayed and missed connection - reason ""it happens traffic"". When I miss my flight because of traffic American charges passengers we should have vouchers for every time an Airlines misses timelines."
3225,Flew with AA on our internal flights in Economy Plus due to one of our team being Gold with Qantas. That little extra leg room makes the difference. They were all short flights of no more than 2 hours so not getting feed was not an issue. Check in was good and service was friendly. We had a 2 hour delay in Miami due to a fuel delivery issue that was affecting most of the airport not just our flight. They keep us well informed. We had to terminate one of our through flights in Chicago on our way to St Louis due to one of our team becoming ill. We went straight to check-in to advise them that we would not be continuing our flight to St Louis and they were unable to stop our bags from going to St Louis. But they did everything they could to return our bags to us. They put them on the first flight back to Chicago and delivered them to our hotel later than night. Great service. Overall great flights and friendly service and excellent at returning our bags.
3226,LHR-MIA-GRU and GRU-JFK. Very quiet plane and cheery crew London to Miami Miami to Sao Paulo delayed about 90 minutes and crew a bit more grumpy. But they were sunny by comparison with the miserable team who took us up from GRU to JFK - good job there was superb IFE on a brand new plane (with disco lighting) to make up for it. I don't the cardigans and ties at half-mast helped. Having said that the AA/Oneworld staff at JFK did a great job in helping me transfer in about 30 minutes in order to catch a BA flight back to LHR.
3227,Usually fly oneworld carriers. Last flight on American was a complete disaster. Boarded on time and it took 2 hrs before take off no explanation given until we left the gate. Very old 757. They said maintenance. Still some FA appeared on board before departing. Once airborne no service on a 4hr flight to SJU from JFK only food for purchase. FA rude and not professional. Arrived very late. It took more than 45 min to get luggage.
3228,"SEA-DFW-MIA-MVD both ways flights. I had low expectations based on previous trips on this route with this airline. Even when the 767 airplanes they are using on the MIA-MVD route are old beaten down and the business class seating is at the minimum acceptable level the price matches what one can consider a ""budget trip"". However I could smell unpleasant odors from the bathrooms both ways from MVD while seating on row 3 in business class. This may not be acceptable to any business class passenger I must say. Also I verified that bathrooms were not cleaned by the staff. Perhaps some disinfecting towels would do passengers can clean the bathrooms by themselves and help with the smell. Anything but making your stomach revolt when having your dinner or breakfast in business class. I sincerely hope that American Airlines replace their aircraft on the MIA-MVD route as soon as possible with more suitable modern aircraft."
3229,"Flt 986 St Thomas to Miami. ATC Delay in Miami (didn't tell us why but probably weather) not AA fault. Our aircraft left Miami for St Thomas returned due to medical emergency not AA fault. Aircraft arrived St Thomas and we departed 7.40pm (instead of 2.58pm) not AA fault. Arrived Miami and after 3 hours standing in line because in spite of knowing the flight was delayed four hours no one checked hotel room availability. We received meal vouchers for dinner ($12 and the restaurants were closed) voucher for hotel room (received at 2am waited 35 minutes for a van to a Holiday Inn had to be back at 5 to take advantage of the breakfast voucher $6 before the 7.14am flight to Dallas). Try to buy dinner for $12 or breakfast for $6 at Miami international. While we were in line no movement for over an hour because no one had checked room availability. Two attendants initially handling the entire rebooking for the flight. After over an hour another showed up at an adjacent gate. Shortly 'Denise' decided it was time for her to leave. She was 'supposed to leave twenty minutes ago"". Extremely poor planning overall. Poor accommodation after the fact. This is becoming the typical customer service quality for American and is really disappointing."
3230,AA51 LHR - DFW in new 773. American have hit the bullseye! Excellent service and food from the crew. AVOD system has more movies than you can look at! The seat is extremely comfortable. Inflight bar area is a nice place to stretch and have a chat. Definitely look to fly on this plane again.
3231,"LAX-DFW-ATL AA2410 1 Sep 14. S80 ancient aircraft. Very uncomfortable seats. Almost one-hour delay in DFW because of ""broken-seat"" paperwork. Delay in landing at ATL because we lost our gate. Slow baggage handling. Staying away from AA for a year or so."
3232,We flew from Manchester to New York at the end of August as a couple. We were surprised to be automatically allocated leg-room seats by an emergency exit at no extra cost. However we were extremely surprised and disappointed to be on a very old plane (still old logo) and had no personal TV screens for a long haul flight! I have never encountered this before. We could also barely see the shared TV screens. Only one film of two was shown. The air hostesses were distracted tired looking and talking amongst themselves for much of the flight. It felt like an internal AA flight. All the same was exactly true for our return flight but furthermore they could not seat us together on our wedding anniversary. If this is how UK Manchester customers are treated (the same surely can't be true flying out of London!) then prices should reflect the poor service. Avoid AA if at all possible.
3233,I flew early September 14 from Kuala Lumpur to Hartford CT return. The quality was very uneven. From KL to Hartford it was okay. On the long parts (KL to Frankfurt Frankfurt to Charlotte) we were given two meals and a snack. The meals were okay but I was disappointed on the snack which was cookies and chocolate. Of course no menu as with Etihad and Qatar. I know I know I chose the airline because of the low price. I was even more disappointed on the trip back. On the flight from Chicago to London the seats and space were so tight we could barely move. The plane looked old and shabby. It still had those communal TV!. Come on! On a 7-hour flight? Those things were so outdated! The flight from Heathrow was much better. It's the new A380. Still food was not much better. By the way flights from KL to Europe and Europe to KL were operated by Malaysian Airlines but the ones from Europe to US and vice versa were by AA. Overall I wouldn't recommend taking AA flying from Asia to US.
3234,"LAS-DFW-LGA-YUL. All flights were smooth and on time. The service the flight attendants and the seat comfort were fine nothing special. The second leg it was full and it was a hassle before take off with all the carry on bags the crew were asking passengers to collaborate by placing their smaller item under the front seat. This is what it happens when airlines charge for check in bags. You have to purchase the meal on board but the crew with a few smiles serves complimentary non alcoholic drinks. I found it weird when the crew were saying ""We know that you have a choice thank you for choosing us"" during their announcements. I chose American Airlines simply because it offered a lower price despite the long trip I had to do. Overall this airline is not amazing but it's slightly better than some low cost airlines. I would fly with them if they offer a low price."
3235,"Brand new 773 lovely looking aircraft clean interior but inferior product and service compared to alliance partner British Airways. 10 abreast seating is appalling for a long haul flight no comfort no headphones (this caught a lot of passengers out) cabin crew responded with ""the company doesn't give us any!"" - limited interaction with the passengers throughout flight. All in all very disappointing service with the ""new American""."
3236,"After a 6 hour delay originally attributed to a broken air conditioning component estimated to take ""45 minutes"" to fix myself and several other passengers changed our tickets to another later flight to the same destination. After being boarded on that second aircraft we were informed that the ""maintenance log had been removed from the aircraft and not returned as expected"" so we would need to wait until it was located. Initially this appeared to be mere incompetence but swiftly came to seem like subterfuge. Fully an hour later we have just been told there is a panel on our aircraft that has to be replaced. This is supposed to take 1 hour. Meanwhile our original aircraft remains grounded without further explanation. As a passenger I am apprehensive flying on aircraft in such poor repair and moreover feel deceived repeatedly by gate agents and flight crew who are either misinformed themselves or deliberately trying to hide the sorry state of American's fleet. This will be my last flight on American were I not attempting to attend a family wedding I would deplane now."
3237,Flew from DFW to LHR on a 777-200 with my seven year old daughter. This flight was completely full but was acceptable for a long haul flight. The crew were very nice and helpful with my daughter and made her feel at home on her first transatlantic flight. The food and beverage was quite good for economy. Coming back to the USA was an entirely different story. Flew from DUB-Chicago on an old outdated 767-300 that smelt bad and looked very worn. The carpet was dirty and so was the seats. Additionally it was unacceptable to fly transatlantic with community video screens that appear to be running from a DVD setup with poor picture quality and sound. Again the crew was fantastic and treated my daughter extremely well and was very help with making arrangements to catch our next flight to Dallas even though we arrived over an hour late. Completing Customs and Immigration in Dublin saved us from missing out next flight. For the money paid the quality experience was unacceptable.
3238,Flight from London to Miami then Miami to La Paz. By far the most disappointing flight we have had. The cabin crew were unbelievably rude disinterested and unhelpful. We've had much better service with budget airlines. Thought it was ridiculous that people could reserve seats up to one year in advance. Our flights were booked by a tour company so we were unaware of this until a few days before and therefore left with disappointing seats on the way out to our honeymoon destination. Will not fly with American Airlines again.
3239,"LHR to Miami return. Where to start. New logo - but old plane old staff old service. 'Turkey slider' in business class? Pre-formed mush. Surly badly dressed cabin crew. One of them was chewing gum and playing Candy Crush when I went to the bathroom! AA lounges in LHR awful - compare that to BA or Virgin! Even worse lounge in Miami - two vouchers for free drinks - for £4k? 13 year old 777 noisy  flat bed only goes down part way and worst of all - no laptop power adapters available ""We've stopped providing them""! Well you know what I've stopped using AA."
3240,FCO-ORD. ORD-CMH Flew an ancient plane with no IFE with one shared TV. Seats were uncomfortable. Food was better this time around although the service was bad. The crew missed out serving several rows multiple times on the flight although they kept the drinks coming very frequent. One of the crew members stopped the food service for close to 10 minutes to continue speaking to a passenger about her family.
3241,DFW-ABQ on Aug. 8 and return ABQ-DFW on Aug 15 both legs in First (due to upgrade) on an MD80. Flights nothing special but OK given the limitations on US domestic flights - obviously older planes but comfortable and cabins looked fresher than expected so obviously well maintained/renovated. Catering in First for both 100 minute flights during meal hours was a pack of pretzels and full bar service. White wine on the evening flight to ABQ was warm Chardonnay. FA's were friendly and efficient on the on the flight to ABQ and rather uninterested on the flight back to DFW. Delay of 45 minutes on the flight to ABQ but AA maintained that the flight will be on time until 15 minutes before the designated departure time although a delay was obvious as there was no plane at the gate so slightly irritating bad communication. Return flight eventless and on time. So nothing special but no major problems either. All in all a very average experience.
3242,Recently flew this airline transatlantic route from Dublin to Chicago. The experience was awful! The plane itself was so outdated and old fashioned. It had the screens that dropped down from the ceiling! However on the outward bound flight the crew announced they were not working. So I had a seven hour flight with no film . The crew all wore different uniforms which made them look shabby and unprofessional. I am used to flying European airlines like BA and Aer Lingus whose planes all have the modern personal screens etc and whose cabin crew look smart and professional. My advice is stay well away from AA. I will never again use this airline.
3243,Flight from Chicago to Cleveland cancelled for no reason. Put on standby 4 flights and 10 hours later with no help from gate attendants we fly into Cleveland. Flying out of Cleveland - flight cancelled night before no reason given. Re-booked on earlier flight. Arrive at airport and or course we're not on the manifest. Staff member very rude. Clearly no one who works for American likes it or it's customers either. Since American had cancelled 3 flights the day before they had nothing to do but put us on a United flight where we had to pay an extra $160 for baggage hat we would not have had to pay as our origin tickets were on Alaska Airlines. Never again.
3244,American Airlines cancelled a flight with no warning claimed weather related but on looking at radar for this flight path that was fabricated. They made no effort to notify by email or cell phone (had both). I found out about the canceled flight when I arrived at the gate with my boarding pass. This resulted in a 15 hour drive. My advice - find a different airline.
3245,Flew out to Dallas from Heathrow in the new Boeing 777 which as a plane was okay and had good entertainment. They have a 343 layout which makes it cramped compared to a lot of other airlines I have flown with which have a 333 layout which feels more spacious. Some of the flight crew were quite unprofessional. One of them walking around with earphones in holding his iPod in his hand. Food was close to terrible. Returned on a Boeing 767 which had been painted on the outside to make it look modern but was like a museum on the inside. Old TV monitors hanging from the ceiling which showed one film on a nine hour flight which I couldn't watch as somebody had snapped off their headphone jack in my socket. Checked in really early but still sat apart. Food terrible again but flight crew a bit more professional this time. Have flown over 30 different airlines and I would say this airline is in the bottom 3.
3246,GRU-JFK and JFK-LHR: American Main Cabin Extra. Exit seat on both flights. Excellent price brand new planes. Greatly improved service food improved. There are better airlines for premium service nicer food but if you can make Platinum (50000 miles a year) then this is for me unbeatable. Free Main Cabin Extra Lounge Access double miles punctual flights on new planes.
3247,Was in Vegas headed to Dallas. The weather had been bad that morning in Dallas. Contacted my husband about the weather when it came to my flight home and the weather was clear. They had delayed our trip for 9 hours for no apparent reason and had failed to inform us of this. They had delays due to weather early that morning the flight coming from Dallas to Vegas was sitting at the airport and wouldn't load their passengers. Waited around for 9 hours only to find out by 10 pm that night that the flight was cancelled and it was too late to get a hotel. The staff in Vegas were very rude and pretentious. They didn't care about any of the passengers and were snappy when asked questions. I do not recommend this airline at all!
3248,This is a general review of American Airlines. Since 2000 I have flown with AA more than any other airline racking up nearly 1 million miles most in Economy some in Economy Plus and some in First Class. Maybe it's because I have so much experience that little things and small delays do not phase me but I have rarely had a problem so bad that I felt the need to contact AA customer service and I've never written a negative review. Yes it would be nice to get a snack with your beverage like Delta gives but I can bring my own package of cookies or peanuts if I want. And yes the MD-80 aircraft does not have inflight entertainment but they've had powerports on MD80s for a long time and then I've got a fully-charged laptop and smart phone to entertain me. Yes I've run into weather delays in Chicago during the winter which is why I connect through Dallas whenever possible. Yes it would be nice if they would upgrade some of their gate areas with more power plugs and offer their gate agents some sort of incentives to be a little nicer with regular passengers and not just us elite passengers. And yes sometimes they want more money for the same route as a competitor and those are the times I book with another carrier. But throughout my near-million miles and 14 years flying AA I still recommend the airline to my friends and family to get them anywhere in the world they need to go safely on time and for a reasonable cost.
3249,I am not picky about the airlines and used to travel by the cheapest deals available. This time I took AA. Flying American Airlines was the worst experience for me. The planes were mostly old and run down. They took 2 hrs to fix the bolt and screws while flying to San Diego on flight AA 49. The staff especially at Dallas boarding desk was rude and changed my seat without an apology. Not only that see was upfront rude. Each flight were at least an hour or 2 late. There are definitely better options and I would not fly this airline again.
3250,"I was flying from Dublin to JFK NY on July 30 flight 291. I got the impression that serving the needs of the passengers was not a priority. I had reported to a flight attendant about some good amount of water sloshing around in the lavatory. It was slippery and the dirty liquid had got on my shoes and clothing. The flight attendant replied that she did not think the liquid was water and was not going to touch it. I do not understand why it could not have been mopped up. I think is was very inappropriate of the Airline to not train their flight attendants in mopping up unpleasant ""spills"" in the lavatories and providing them the sanitary means of doing so. This was upsetting to me to have to use lavatories with unsanitary conditions on an airline! The American Airline website makes it very difficult to send a complaint to. I think this is very important for them to see this and to correct it. I gave the airline poor ratings and do not plan to fly it again."
3251,"Flew London Heathrow to JFK. Had transferred from Qatar from JNB-DOH-LHR. This was a bit like going from a fine Hotel (Qatar) to a cheap roadside motel (American). The American Business Class lounge/Admirals Club lounge at LHR beyond the new entrance is simply a dump. Old tired furniture no charm or ambience and an almost complete lack of any kind of decent food or snacks. I saw one tureen of dried up pasta and some pretzels and 2-3 halves of white bread sandwiches. Self serve beverages were somewhat limited with cheap brands of alcohol and ""spouts"" on the wine bottles-a really low class touch. Although the roughly half full business does have a state of the art flat bed seat with decent storage the cabin service was dismal. Pre departure beverages were served in flimsy plastic glasses. Cabin staff attitude throughout the flight was casual and usually indifferent. I slept until approx. 1.5 hours before landing missing the snack service. No a single member of the cabin crew offered to serve it to me later. The rear lavatories were devoid of any cosmetics the forward lavatories were stocked. Of course there were no flowers in the lavatories. Catering was adequate the menu was a tiny card like affair nothing like the elegant and extensive menu presented in a folder on Qatar. I am thoroughly convinced that flying on American or any US Airline on long distance flights is wasting money and accepting poor treatment and it makes more sense to choose non US airlines which offer their premium customers a much higher standard of service."
3252,JFK-MXP-JFK. Both flights departed a few minutes early and arrived on time. Aircraft was an 'updated' 767-300ER with the new Biz Class and Main Cabin Extra where we were seated. Had the bulkhead seat both ways in this mini MCE cabin of 2 rows which made a difference. Service was ok food below average from JFK but much better from Milan. The only real downer is the lack of personal IFE or streaming IFE on this plane only main screen entertainment was available. Were lucky though to have a professional friendly and warm flight attendant from Milan.
3253,ORD-MIA-GRU in Economy on July 28. Daylight flight from Miami to Sao Paulo - delayed 4 hours and that is where American failed its passengers. They boarded us and at the departure time they asked us to de-board as the plane has mechanical issues. Ok - fine. They say there is a plane at a gate that will take us to SP and they just need to service the plane. That was a lie - all the passengers got to the gate (and we had been told to take our pillows and blankets as the new plane wouldn't have them) and there was no plane. We sat around for 3 hours before a plane showed up from the hanger where 4 AA 777s sat the whole time. Finally board and take off - 8 hour flight and flight attendants were friendly. Seat comfort is awful - no leg room due to entertainment box at the window. Seat cushion is non-existent so luckly the extra pillow helped (we got on the plane and blankets and pillows were already there). Upon landing in Sao Paulo at 12:10am (4 hours late) we finally got an apology from the flight deck - until then they didn't say a thing about the delay. Come on American - have some respect for the people who pay your bills. I did get an email when I landed with an apology and 5000 AA miles - ok - that's nice. But I felt sorry for the many passengers who missed connecting flights at 12.10am there are no more flights until morning. I had a 2.5 hour drive to Santos and didn't get to my hotel until 3am. When AA does it well - its great. When they fail - its really bad.
3254,July 31 - CWB-POA-MIA-ORD. 767-300 from CWB to Miami in Business Class. Flight boarded and crew had just come in from Miami. They were awful - no one said hello or offered a drink until just before we departed 45 minutes late to Porto Alegre. I understand they are tired - AA needs to change crew at Curitiba and have a fresh crew all the way to MIA. Landed 30 min behind schedule at POA - had to exit the plane and they gave us new boarding passes and just waited in the gate area for boarding. Little cafe had snacks and flight was packed (in coach - 1/2 full in Biz) so gate area was busy. POA-MIA - excellent service! Flight attendants were so friendly and accommodating. Greeted you by name - were always in the cabin even though the flight leaves POA at 12:05am - with water and snacks. Slept well and had a quick breakfast before landing in Miami. Aborted landing due to some warning light in the cockpit but did a fly around and landed safely. A really nice flight once we got the new crew at POA. This is the type of service that makes AA stand out.
3255,JFK to LHR. AA's problems are no longer the fleet its old tired flight attendants that should be in bed rather than serving passengers paying up to $6000 for a business class seat with an attitude and a lack of respect that is simply unacceptable. Other passengers complained as well. Just impersonal and rude service on AA104. American needs to ground those FA's that are older and with attitude. Hire younger FA's that want to do their job rather than complaining to passengers about how the airlines have changed and how what we pay for the seats isn't worth it. After 33 years I'm not flying AA anymore. Ill go BA or anything other than an American carrier. They just honestly are awful now and I see no change due to them being union. Fly a foreign carrier. You'll see the difference.
3256,We flew from Shreveport LA to DFW. We then flew from Dallas to London. Neither plane left on time or got us there on time. We had people waiting in London. Same happened on the way back. On the way back we were shuttled to British Airways. Got to Dallas had a six hour layover. Because British Airways was late getting us to Dallas the layover was five hours. We sat in the airport in Dallas for 4.5 hours at the gate we were supposed to leave from. Twenty minutes before the plane was to leave from Dallas the gate was changed and we had to run to get to the new gate. I have come to the conclusion that American Airlines doesn't care at all about their customers. For the prices people are charged for tickets and fees you would think service would be better. Won't fly American again.
3257,My husband and I recently flew American first class from SFO through DFW to SDF. This was a last minute change from a ticket on another airline that allows cancellations without penalty because we found our outbound trip to be somewhat stressful. We are delighted we made the change. The one way fare was very reasonable and the service was superior. The SFO to DFW leg was on a wifi equipped 737. We were in seats 3F and 4F and both of us had plenty of legroom and the seats were very comfortable. Entertainment was Rio 2 which we didn't watch because we were reading (and eating). Breakfast for me was granola fruit salad orange juice coffee and a hot biscuit with jam. I am a southern girl and take pride in my own biscuits and I have to say the AA version was excellent. The other choice was a strata with muffin which my husband also found quite tasty the flight attendant passed the muffin/biscuit basket a couple of times but we were too full to partake. At the end of the flight she stopped by each seat and thanked us for flying American. The DFW to SDF leg was on an A312 which was quiet (a little noisy on takeoff) and sturdy. In flight entertainment choice (personal TV) was excellent - many movies TV and music channels to choose from. The snack was also quite good - I had a salad with poached chicken quinoa asparagus and arugula with a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie. Husband had an open-faced turkey/tomato/gruyere sandwich on fresh bread with a macadamia nut cookie. He also had a tumbler of red wine I had a diet Pepsi (they also offer Coke products). The flight attendant was also quite attentive and spoke with us by name. We felt very well taken care of.
3258,On my MIA-LHR leg I flew the 777-200 which is an awful configuration 2-3-2. What a lovely surprise on the way back to fly a 777-300 with a great configuration of 1-2-1. I was by the window great. Upgraded seat and a great crew to complement it. Wish AA would get rid of the 2-3-2 configuration in business - pathetic.
3259,July 31 we were on flight 3143 NAS to MIA. Flight was scheduled to take off at 605. We were on the runway on time when a passenger became ill. We returned to the terminal. They left her on board until a paramedic arrived to check her out. At this point she felt better and wanted to continue but had to wait until someone from headquarters arrived to determine if it was safe for her to stay on the flight. They took her off the plane then allowed her to return then took her off again. Every person on that plane had a connecting flight to catch. They then had to refuel the plane. We then got back on the runway then had to go back to check out a maintenance issue. We sat there another 30 minutes. Then we had to get off the plane while they worked on it. At 9.30 we boarded again then had to wait for a passenger who couldn't decide whether or not to continue. We finally left NAS at 10 pm. When we landed in MIA we had to go back through customs find our luggage then try to find someone from AA to help us all reschedule flights. No one from AA was available to help us until after 11 pm. They put us up overnight at a local hotel and rescheduled all our flights for the next day but it was a very poorly handled situation. I do not plan to use AA in the future. We have used other airlines many times and have had issues but never anything handled this poorly.
3260,I have been an airline passenger for the past 60 years. All types of planes to all types of destinations with all types of carriers. The golden years you might say when the flights were not only comfortable but fun and even riotous at times! The service food and drinks (especially the drinks) were an integral and indispensable part of the experience. It is sad to see what was once a wonderful and exciting experience reduced to the level of a bus ride and a damn uncomfortable bus ride at that! Flight AA121 Paris (CDG) to New York (JFK) July 2nd 2014 gave a glimmer of hope. The cabin crew were experienced co-ordinated pleasant and most helpful.
3261,We flew from LHR-JFK with AA101 in economy I also had low expectations about reading several reviews here on the website. Strangely enough it was a nice and overall experience with AA. B777-300 the cabin looks fresh and airy. The stewards and stewardesses ages were no lower than 50 years but the steward on duty on my aisle was very friendly. Food was ok we had a choice between chicken or pasta (no menu distributed) and an hour before arrival they distributed hot pizza and in between several rounds of drinks. Flight departed on time and arrived in JFK almost right on time. Overall experience was better than expected and I'll fly them again!
3262,"We paid for 6 business class tickets from Zurich via London to Dallas. Then 4 business class tickets from Los Angeles to London to Zurich. I've never seen a more consistent disgruntled group of employees in all of the years I've flown overseas. Where to begin? We chose American because of the ""New"" business class. We were given an old plane. My family is very low maintenance. We only ask for simple respect. We are mid flight and AA cancels our connection from Dallas to Grand Junction. 10 hours before we are to board. We don't get the notification until we reach our gate to fly to Grand Junction. No effort on AA part at all to help us. No hotel no car service. We make our own arrangements. This may seem small but by this point we are exhausted. Any help at all by AA would have been appreciated. Our return trip. I went for more water I was told they only had the large bottles. If I wanted more water I could bring my small empty water bottle up and refill it. Not how can I help you? Not can I bring the water to you? They stand there chatting while I try to refill my bottle."
3263,JFK-LAX return in F on the new A321 transcon product. American has really upped their game here. The hard product is outstanding in terms of privacy comfort and durability. Feels very exclusive and closer to the luxury that Asian and some European carriers are offering in long haul configurations. Outbound check-in was prompt although not very helpful with navigating the chaos that was security at JFK T8. Onboard service was exceedingly professional albeit not intrusive but that's the way I like it. Purser kept a watchful eye on the 10 pax in the cabin and was very prompt with drink refills or any other needs. Food was above expectations and in fact quite tasty. Could have a better champagne for first class (it is in fact not a real champagne but a domestic sparkling wine) but that's a first world problem of course. Pillow and blanket provided were of good quality could use a mattress pad for overnight flights. On the return check in at LAX Flagship was quick and friendly brought to the front of the security line which was nice. Can't comment on onboard service on the return because once we hit 10000 feet I put the seat into bed mode and slept a complete four and a half hours of solid sleep waking just before descent. This is a first for me in over 25 years of travel. For that reason alone I fully commend this product. It's a game changer for the NY-LA market.
3264,I recently flew with AA and US Airways from New York Boston and Washington DC. I cannot believe that American Airlines is part of the One World Alliance. When you look at the level of service you get from world class airlines like Qantas Cathay Pacific and LAN and then see the pathetic offering you get from AA I am dumbstruck. As a frequent Australian traveller I absolutely hate having to use AA anytime. Their Admirals Club lounges are truly pathetic - paying for food and pseudo-snacks like pretzels and plastic wrapped muffins. AA passengers who fly Qantas and use the Qantas Club lounges must be amazed. The service on AA is uniformly awful and rude. How can Americans put up with such an array of shocking airline companies. Now that AA have bought US Airways it will be doubly bad.
3265,My flight out of Chicago was delayed for hours and then cancelled at 1am. Understandable taking into consideration Chicago weather. However it was the customer service received during and after this that convinced me to end my days as an American Airlines flyer. I spent the next few hours on hold with customer service trying to get my flight rebooked. After 3.5 hours on hold I booked a flight for the following morning through the AA website to ensure that I would return home on time. The next morning unable once again to contact customer service I boarded the flight and made it home in time to return to work. Only after I finally contacted customer service did I learn that I had in fact been booked on a rescheduled flight. I searched my inbox spam and trash but had received no sort of email or notification of the rescheduling. If I had been informed of this flight or been able to contact customer service I could have foregone the cost of a second flight and avoided all of the frustrating cold emails that have taken place since.
3266,DFW to PDX - the service was terrible. First the price: it was $360 round-trip non-stop. While this may sound like a good deal it was not too long ago that American wanted $500 for the same trip. I could go to Europe one- way for that! The price drop is the only reason why I give them 2 out of 5 stars for value. If it weren't for that I would give them one-star without a second thought. Second the lines for baggage check were long. Apparently this airline does not realize that it's 2014: I was completely unable to pay my baggage fee online and there was no fast check-in option either. So I had to wait in line to do something I could have done online with other air carriers and only takes five minutes at most with other ones. Third the seats. They were harder than rocks with virtually no leg room with my messenger bag below the seat in front of me. It was virtually impossible to sleep or rest in my seat. When I got off the plane I was very sore. The flight attendants did not care about my experience and the check-in agents flat out ignored me at PDX. Lastly when I emailed American with a complaint about these issues I got the most sarcastic response I have ever got from a customer service representative. In conclusion I never plan on flying American again. I'd rather have a stop (or two!) than fly them.
3267,We had a really good flight with a very nice and obliging crew! Food was very good also the entertainment program and the seats. We will always fly with AA again!
3268,I will never fly AA again. The Miami staff were very rude and not accommodating at all. Flight was late leaving from Turks and Caicos and staff failed to announce the delay by half an hour. Therefore I missed my connecting flight in Miami to LGA. Miami Staff were not accommodating. I had an older aunt with me and I asked for a wheelchair twice it never came. AA staff had no sense of direction or didn't speak enough English - it was terrible! Never again.
3269,LHR-JFK. I had low expectations due to reviews posted here. I was therefore happy to discover that the plane was new (and/or very clean) seats were comfortable flight attendants warm and friendly. The flight was full and the flight attendants graciously offered passengers the option to spread out so that we can be comfortable. Meals were hot and nicely prepared. IFE was varied and up to date WiFi available on board but not free. The pilot was very pleasant in his announcements that I didn't mind the delay in landing/parking due to the rains in NY. It seems AA is starting to up its game starting with international flights. Will most probably fly AA again in the future.
3270,"Let me start by saying I am a regular business flier and travel frequently although because of issues like the following complaint usually only fly AA as a last resort. On a recent trip from LGA to DFW AA forced me to gate- check my same standard 22in. carry-on bag which I take on every flight on every other airline. The bag clearly fit within the test box when I had to test it the first time going through the security checkpoint and similarly fit again when forced to test it at the gate but because the agent said I had to ""push"" it down to fit within the box it was too big and had to be checked. When I boarded the plane I was frustrated to see that the bag would have easily fit within the overhead compartment. Maybe AA has smaller jets with smaller overhear storage capacity than every other major airline. This was a big inconvenience and was easily avoidable and I will continue to avoid flying on AA whenever possible."
3271,The boarding passes we printed out at DFW Airport showed that the flight from DFW to TYR originally scheduled at 6pm was delayed to 8pm. We still went to the gate to see if the delay was changed. The monitor showed that the flight was delayed to 8pm. After we returned to the gate at 7pm we were told the flight left at 6.30. There was no more flights from DFW to TYR afterwards. The assistant checked us in for the 9.00 flight the next day. When we requested whether there was a voucher for a hotel we were told no. We called the customer service and were blamed for not listening to the announcements. We had to rent a car to return home and drove back to DFW next day to return the rental car. Each person was trying to shift the responsibility away to somebody else. If they made profits by charging passengers more and providing less service whats to celebrate?
3272,Flight AA1018 DUS-LHR on 5/6/2014 onboard N936NN (B738). Flight was on time and smooth. Food and drinks to buy. Crew were typically American and not that friendly. Legroom was adequate but no more.
3273,From LA to Chicago on 22nd June on American Airlines. Perfect service from staff at the airport to FA's on the plane. I have read a lot of bad reviews on this website but can only say my husband and I found our flight more than we expected. Our luggage was delayed for about an hour but this was I believe only due to two planes arriving at the same time.
3274,Flight from Germany to Charlotte NC to Huntsville AL in 05/2014 was the worst flight experience. TV screen did not work staff was not concerned after numerous requests. The aircraft had a malfunction before takeoff in NC delaying us 3 hours on the taxiway. This caused a missed flight at the connection stop. American did not care whatsoever and we had to ask to get a meal voucher but that was all that was given. They would only put us on another American flight that left hours later putting us home in the middle of the night and needed to be at work the next morning. Worst airline ever. This review only covers about 65% of the issues experienced.
3275,LHR-MIA-LHR. It is some time since I have flown AA transatlantic after many years of having previously done so when both the hard and soft products were truly appalling. This choice came about as a result of the fare being two-thirds of the next best so difficult to ignore. Both sectors were by B77W equipment with the new Business Class configuration. This is a vast improvement. The cabin crew actually seemed to enjoy being there (almost) although the sole male cabin crew member in Business on the return flight was extremely obnoxious. Food was ok- ish and whilst I had chosen my entrees on-line for both sectors there was no record on board of any of my selections. The cabin crew told me that this on-line facility was a complete waste of time as it never worked. Overall AA was better than my recollection of many years before but hard product apart it continues to be still a long way behind the alternatives.
3276,Booked flights for the husband and I from BOS to MIA in October. Received an email changing our flight times and seats after we had purchased and selected. Threw us off the original time and put another flight number in its place. Had no reasonable explanation other than they are re-figuring their planes! Really messed up our departure for sure. The planes are so old and dirty. Couldn't even use the bathroom as it was filthy on our last flight. The attendants were miserable! TV monitors were from the dark ages not to mention the inside condition of the plane. It was falling apart from the inside. Could see the outer shell from my seat! Charge megabucks for low class experience.
3277,MIA-BOG-MIA. Both sectors were flown by very tired B752s with equally tired cabin crews. I have been flying these sectors along with other Latin routes with (Latin) American Airlines which bears little resemblance to AA mainline for some 25 years on the same aircraft type with the same take-it or leave-it cabin crew attitudes. Wifi and in-flight power is heavily advertised on these aircraft but were not available on either sector. Both aircraft and cabin crew are in need of a substantial refresh.
3278,Will never fly AA again. The experience at Dallas was terrible. Flight was late therefore missed flight. Boarded another flight but told to get off due to mechanical problem. Very little information on what to do next. Sent to four different gates. Treated like cattle. Never made it out that day and no guarantee to fly next day. Forced to go to a different airport and buy another ticket on Southwest. No apologies by AA personnel. Customer service was the worst I've experienced in over 50 years of traveling.
3279,I travelled American Airlines on Flight AA55 from Manchester UK to Chicago. This was an awful flight. The aircraft had no in seat entertainment the seats were old and uncomfortable the headrests hardly lifted above the seat so for a taller person the backrest sticks in your back. In addition the staff were at best terse at worst indifferent. I can only believe they are as fed up as I was being stuck on that aircraft. On the bright side it arrived on time overall however it was a prime example of a truly budget flight the only thing is I paid a lot of money for the flight. I only went this route because I needed to go to Chicago never again.
3280,I purchased a flight with American Airline to fly from Miami to New Orleans on July 3-7. They changed my flight to US Air but didn't inform me until one week before flight. I paid for upgrade seats but it was not transferred over. Now what really bother me was my return trip home from New Orleans well I didn't get back until a day later. Both airlines seemed to simply want to place blame on each other when they should be working together on rescheduling flights when they cancel them. American whom I booked with originally were of absolutely no use to me once they changed me to a US Air flight. Though it took many back and forth trips between the two companies finally a supervisor with US Air provided me with some assistance in getting me booked on another flight to fly out a day later. It's ridiculous that it would take me 4 hours in the airport to get rescheduled when I checked in well in advance (4hours) after my flight was canceled. I should not have needed a supervisor to get my flight rescheduled all agents should be able to do it. I went through 5 agents between AA and US Air and none were helpful. When airlines join forces to become one company they should be operating as one not passing the buck and blame between each other.
3281,Took AA on a trip to Spain. En route two of my three flights were delayed almost causing me to miss a connection and my baggage was lost - not sure if by American or one of the affiliated carriers. The worst was yet to come however. My flight from Madrid to NYC was delayed by a couple hours and so I was rebooked for my connecting flight. I wish I'd insisted on catching it since it was delayed anyway because what transpired after was unbelievable. The rebooked flight to DC was eventually canceled. We sat on the tarmac for 2.5 hours as maintenance repaired a broken chair then a door and then we lost our slot in the queue and had to wait awhile and then my home airport suspended flights coming and going due to weather. Finally the pilot took us back to the gate and told us our flight was canceled. 4 hours on the tarmac that day. Service to rebook flights was slow and some agents were a bit snippy. Slept at the gate overnight for my early flight the next morning. Had a bad feeling when I saw people arriving through the same gate 15 minutes prior to our scheduled boarding time. Sure enough we sat there for well over an hour as the tyre on the plane was being changed and then the flight was canceled. Exasperated I asked for a flight out of LaGuardia instead and although it was delayed on the runway I eventually got home after four bookings from NYC to DC. Very tight seat arrangement on the planes flying back (because they were older). Food wasn't bad and service on all the planes was overall pretty good. Service at the gate ranged from very solicitous to brusque. The airline seems to schedule flights too close together. On top of that the planes on my return trip were all old and shoddy hence the delays. So I ended up being booked for eight flights round trip when I was originally scheduled for just five. Seven of eight were delayed and two of those led to cancellations. American didn't do much to compensate me for the inconvenience either. I will never fly AA again.
3282,Flew from LAX to JFK on AA292 in First Class 14th July. A very good experience on a brand new plane an A321. The seat makes the flight as it converts to a fully lie flat bed and I was able to get a few hours of sleep after having a nice hot breakfast. Good inflight entertainment amenity kit and a great cabin crew who seemed happy to be there. Well done AA!
3283,ORD-SEA first class. Standard first class seats. Nothing special but comfortable. Lunch was surprisingly good. Glad we pre-selected the beef dish. Decent selection of beer and wine. Still don't like the fact that buying a domestic first class ticket doesn't get us into the airline's airline's club but this is standard at least among U.S. airlines.
3284,HKG-DFW. Check-in: no online check-in for some reason had to do it at the airport. Good no problem. Boarding: for all US-bound flights they had to search all our hand-carry bags for water/liquids and they do it in the middle of the bridge where the air isn't moving very well and warm. I don't understand why can't they do it right before scanning the boarding pass. The bridge area is small not a smart idea at all. I feel bad for those in a long line for the economy class. In-flight: Food/meals are very good no complaints there. The seat is excellent with lie-flat bed and big screen monitor. One problem there were several movies/TV shows that are shown available but couldn't get to it. Other than that slept well and services were fine.
3285,"Just flew on Sunday 7/13 on AA's new 777-300 International configuration in business class. I have to say that it was the very first time I have felt that a US carrier competed effectively with front rank international carriers. The seat was excellent. The overall quality of the seat was superior given the amenities screen etc. Just the slightest bit less comfortable than BA's flat seat but not a huge different. The overall seat was superior to anyone else's business class I have been on. The food and beverage service was excellent. Appetizing decent portions well served and proper temperature. Inflight entertainment options are excellent. Beats the angled ""lie flat"" seat on the 767's and older triple 7's. You got it right this time. Even the crew was not as grouchy as AA flight crews have become. Actually I was very pleased."
3286,Had a 6 part trip this month on AA. Every leg had issues. Mechanical problems abound due to the age of the fleet. Arrived at JFK for the vacation portion of this trip and was told at the first class check in that our aircraft was removed from service and we would be 6 hours delayed departing. We missed our first day of vacation and a party because of this. Bottom line you can't rely on this company to get you where you are going in any reliable way. Also have issues with their website frequently down lack of communication with flight delays also.
3287,Just flew 4 domestic sectors LAX-DFW-OMA and DSM-DFW-LAX. Ex LAX boarded on time but then due to weather in DFW were delayed for roughly 2 hours. Informed of delay by Captain and given updates. Once underway beverage service given inflight video shown. Overnight in DFW then to OMA next day. Flight delayed due to mechanical issues. Passengers allowed off plane after first hour cabin crew offered juice and water then granola bars. Flight cancelled after 4 hours. $12 refreshment vouchers given. Replacement aircraft and eventually got away about 5.5 hours late. Whilst this was an inconvenience I believe the staff acted properly keeping passengers informed and making alternate arrangements. Return flight I requested baggage to be checked through to SYD which took some time to organise due to booking problems caused by the earlier delay when I had been taken off the delayed flights but then reinstated. Only complaint was during this time our pre-assigned seats were given away and we were given seats at the back of the aircraft without the additional leg room. All things considered I was happier to have bags checked through and less legroom. I have been critical of AA in the past but thus trip they receive full marks.
3288,I had not flown AA for a few years and now I know why. AA employees sat in first class on a very early flight from TPA-MIA and spoke loudly to one another while the other first class passengers tried to sleep. Had a 7.40pm flight from MIA-TPA but paid a $75 plane change fee to take the 5.50pm flight. No problem there except for the fact that the plane flight 986 from STT-MIA had an alarm mishap and they had to call a maintenance personnel from off-site. He was very late so therefore missed the earlier connection at 5.50pm from MIA-TPA and took my original flight at 7.40pm-no compensation returned for their error. Other members in my party had first class on the 5.50pm flight and did not receive it when we were all booked on the 7.40pm flight. They did attempt to put us all together but placed us in the exit row with two children traveling under the age of 15. Therefore the kids had to sit in other areas in the plane and were scared to sit alone. Upon a later arrival to TPA at 8.40pm AA/US AIR misplaced our luggage and was it was all still sitting in Miami with Priority tags on them. So much for priority as they turned up a day and a half later.
3289,Providenciales - Miami: AA300. Miami - Paris: AA62. Both flights on old aircraft in particular the flight from Miami to Paris was dreadful on an old 767. No AVOD or individual screen. The seats were the most uncomfortable I have experienced. Food was tasteless and bland with portions quite small. Drinks service was decent but really that was all with the flight that was a positive. Staff seemed disinterested and tired during the flight. First and last time I fly with AA.
3290,ORD-JFK/LGA-ORD - July 2-5. I keep seeing a huge increase in great attitudes from flight attendants on AA flights. Very personable and fun on both flights. Departed ORD on-time and landed at JFK early - but taxied around JFK for 30 minutes before getting to our gate. Dinner served was pre-ordered on aa.com and the chicken was very tasty. Return to ORD from LGA - plane was only 60% full and the three flight attendants (DCA-based) were having a great time with everyone. Lots of talking laughing with passengers and very personable. Good dinner served and landed 40 minutes early into ORD. I see a lot of negative reports for AA but I wonder if people are just expecting too much or are exaggerating their issues. Keep up the good work AA!
3291,One month travel itinerary June 10 - July 8. Point here is not as much about inconvenience as how situations are handled. 4 flights cancelled. One due to weather. Paid upgrades are not refunded if flights cancelled per AA reservations. After 3.5 hour wait little or no information given to waiting passengers in cancellation of first leg OGG-LAX. Restaurant employees saw flight crew leave airport. AA would only help passengers with connections. The rest of us scrambled for flights. Locating luggage was a whole other mishap. 2.5 hr flight from QRO-DFW turned into a 10 hour flight touching down in 2 cities to refuel. Water was being rationed. Children first. No food. No offers from ground crews for additional water or even peanuts. No help with connecting flights. No enough cots in airport Terribly mishandled. Connecting flight missed but cancelled anyway. MCI-OGG delayed 4 hours. Equipment not available. Automated message via phone at 2.30 am for 7.30 am flight. Was auto rebooked on flight out a day later. Called and obtained same day departure. Hoping I get out. Remember when flying used to be fun and airlines treated us with courtesy? Note: Have flown all other US carriers AA is cheaper but savings offset by delay costs incurred other problems and poor treatment.
3292,"I flew from Ontario CA to Indianapolis IN by way of Dallas TX (round-trip). All 4 planes were MD-80's - I probably don't need to say much more. These planes should have been taken out of service 10 years ago. I was flying them in the early 90's from ORD to LAX they needed to be retired back then. All 4 flights were delayed because of mechanical problems (ranging from inoperative toilets to loose electrical panels). All 4 planes were filthy - not just the rest rooms and aisles - but the seats windows and tray tables were disgusting. All 4 flights were full - so as we sat on the planes waiting for the ""maintenance issues"" to be resolved we roasted. Given that I had a similar experience on a trip from Palm Springs to Cleveland (round trip 4 flight segments) in April on American I should have known better. But as a ""loyal rewards member"" I booked this last flight on American too - hoping for better equipment and on time service. At this point I don't even expect any aspect of comfort on American flights - I just want a safe plane that lands reasonably on time. Given the last 8 flights that I flew on American planes in the last 90 days I'm not even certain that the old MD-80's are safe anymore. When 6 out of 8 of my flights were delayed for mechanical or maintenance issues I begin to wonder I'm going to start building my miles on United. I'm done with American. P.S. - during the last 20 years I have been ""Gold"" ""Platinum"" and in the ""Concierge Key"" program - so I have witnessed the decline of this airline's quality and on- time performance first-hand."
3293,Flight #7943 from Honolulu to Los Angeles April 25 2014. This airline is terrible. The only reason to choose this airline is that they have so many flights to so many locations. But it is as if they don't like to be in flight service. Both my husband and I have been regular flight passengers for most of our adult lives for business and pleasure. Over the years AA has not improved on any level of their service. Since going online for booking we have yet to have reservation that isn't botched in some way. I am sitting on AA plane as I write this as we wait after flying 5.5 hours for a gate to become available. Though this may be an airport error the connections between flights is so short that many passengers are in threat of missing there next flight. We almost missed our connecting to this flight because only 30 minutes was allotted between flights. I would gladly pay more for better service and have but AA has only increased its prices but not improved the quality of service.
3294,"Pensacola to San Francisco. After paying full fare for a toddler in a seat my pregnant daughter was treated so inconsiderately by American Airlines staff that none of us will ever fly with this airline again. No pre-board because ""there are too many children on this flight"" and they took her stroller away so that she had to carry 2 bags and the child. On one leg of the flight they gave her back the stroller last and nearly made her miss her connection. There is no compassion from this airline!"
3295,Paris to Boston on an old and uncomfortable 757. The worst international business class seat I've ever had. Did anyone from American try sitting in this seat before they selected it? Small personal video screen with terrible resolution and limited choice of films. Food was inedible. The only good about this flight was the crew - friendly and hard working. Luggage took 40 minutes to unload. Overall a terrible experience.
3296,We will never fly with this airline again. Flight out of Moline Il was delayed for an hour because the airplane wasn't there. We finally get a plane and find out from the flight attendant the delay was caused because there was no ramp at their last stop. The pilots did an awesome job getting us to Dallas on time. But then we sat for over an hour waiting to get to a gate. By this time everyone's connecting flights should have left. But we run across the Dallas airport and find out our connecting flight is delayed as well. Seems we didn't have a crew. What a joke. Never again.
3297,"I recently flew from Miami to London. Sat in the economy class. Seat was extremely narrow designed for very slim person. I am 185lbs and 5'11"". For me the seat was very uncomfortable. If you are a large person recommend to buy 2 seats or avoid flying economy. The cabin was very claustrophobic. There was a big wall in front. The quality and the quantity of the food was pathetic. Inedible unless you were real hungry. This airline lowered their standards tremendously. I used 50000 points and paid $68 for this one way flight. In monetary terms approx $700. If the airlines do not stop abusing their passenger I personally will give up long distance flying."
3298,We recently took our family to Maui to celebrate our 48th anniversary. My husband is in his 70's as I am and he has Parkinson's disease. I have recently had a knee replacement so we rented a hotel for the park and fly program as did our daughter's family for a total of $475 so there would be no chance of us being late for our plane which was to leave at 10.35 am. We arrived early as were told to do. Eventually we found that there was a delay of at least 30 minutes. The delay continued to be extended and ended up being a 9 hour wait. AA reps told us there was nothing they could do. The seats are firm plastic with no head rest or place to lean against the wall. We were given a lunch voucher which we used but were never offered a dinner voucher. We became more and more frustrated as time progressed. We finally left for a long flight to Maui with a crew who were unhappy to called out on Father's Day on an unexpected flight. Their attitude reflected that. We were not given anything to compensate for all our problems no free drinks no food. Nothing. We got to our hotel at 3.30 am. On our trip home we were held up because someone had thrown up in the seat but it wasn't cleaned up by the cleaning crew. There was vomit on the seats and in the buckle making it necessary to take off all seat covering and taking out and putting in all new seatbelt apparatus. To top this all off we are AA frequent flyers!
3299,What a horrible product AA offers in the back of the plane for longer flights. I flew from Manaus to Miami overnight and could not get comfortable in the nasty thin under padded seats. The meal service was a soggy ham sandwich and a glutinous dessert while the entertainment was provided by screens that dropped down from the ceilings. Even small Air Canada planes have seat back TVs but American's 737s do not and this on a 5-hour flight. When they dimmed the cabin lights the screens kept playing the film so good luck trying to get any sleep with the flashing lights in your eyes. Awful just awful. It is a throwback to the 1990s.
3300,I recently booked a 9.30am trip to Amarillo through American Airlines (booked it 2 months in advance). The morning of the flight at about 6.30am (while I was headed to the airport) I was called by American Airlines and it was an automated voice recording telling me that my flight had been cancelled and they automatically put me on a 6.30pm flight that night. I had no option to talk to anyone or hear a reasoning on the scenario that was taking place. I had to call back and go through various automated conversations until I finally reached someone. After explaining the situation (and no sympathy was shown) I realized the person could not help me and did not desire to help me. Little did she know I had major wedding events to get to at my destination (hints why I booked an early flight in the first place). I ended up having to book another flight through Southwest Airlines last minute (costing me a fortune) just to make it to the city in time. It was an all around awful experience dealing with an impersonal system that left me without answers paying a fortune and still arriving later than I planned. I will never again try to fly American Airlines.
3301,On our return flight from Orlando to DFW we arrived early to the massive lines at security. Got through and sat down for an early dinner flight delayed. Took our time then another notice flight delayed again. Finally left dinner and walked around got to out terminal flight delayed again. So our 7pm take off was now leaving at 9pm. Sat down and watched TV. Then some people started standing up and getting upset flight now delayed until 11.45pm. Our plane arrived but had to wait on a crew to fly us. Finally got on the plane after midnight and waited another hour on the plane. We were told we might not have enough fuel. Really? The plane had been there at the airport for 3 hours and no one checked to refuel it? Got back to DFW at 2.30am. Only one baggage person there at that time and several bags were missing. 30 minutes waiting to get our bag that came in at an early flight. So 8 hours in the airport and all the explanation we got was it was DFW's fault. Never again.
3302,I was on a round trip Miami to Buenos Aires in business class. I read reviews about the service and aircraft (767-300) being substandard. However I found the seats to be reasonably comfortable and the service by the Buenos Aires based crew was very nice.
3303,Narita - LAX June 25 First Class. A totally acceptable experience except for boarding and off loading. See my previous review for service comments. Boarding for a First class really needs an upgrade first class passengers deserve more. LAX arrival was unacceptable. Remote gate (ok that happens) but first class passengers were herded onto a packed bus for the ride to terminal. Come on not even a special bus for first and business pax? Not a way to get or keep premium passengers.
3304,June 15-19 supposed to depart from Knoxville to Dallas to Las Vegas but were made to drive from Knoxville to Nashville. Route ended up being Nashville to Dallas to Las Vegas and vice versa. Our flight was changed several times by the airline before departure date. On the date of departure we received an automated phone call 3 hours before take off notifying us that our plane was delayed 4 hours. This interfered with our connecting flight and there was not another flight that would have us reaching our destination until the next day. I contacted the airline immediately and they confirmed that if they re-routed us we could reach our destination. We agreed to this and proceeded to the airport. Upon arrival we were unable to check in. An hour later it was discovered that when re-routing us the person had neglected to issue us a ticket and now our flight was over booked. Our only option was to drive 2.5 hours to another airport catch a flight there and then have 15 minutes between connecting flights that we were to try and get to the gate and board in time. Somehow we managed to make it and made it to our destination. On our return trip we again couldn't check in and had to see an attendant. Everyone we encountered was extremely rude and hateful. I will never fly American Airlines again.
3305,If you're looking for a company that will fly you in the least comfort at the highest price then look no further – you found it. It is inconceivable that American Airlines are still flying old planes with no individual entertainment systems on their transatlantic crossing and charging more than anyone else for the privilege. They didn't even show the film they advertised. We only flew from JFK to Buffalo (with a rival company) a flight of just over an hour and they had individual entertainment screens. To add insult to injury AA ran an ad telling us all how they are adding a new plane every week to their fleet! All I can say is watch out AA when Thomson starts flying the Dreamliner from Manchester to JFK in May 2015 I do not predict a very prosperous future for them.
3306,LHR-MIA 11 June 777-300ER in Main Cabin Extra. I read a lot of complaints about American but it is an American airline serving American tastes. It has no desire to compete with the significantly better Asian and Mid East airlines and it would seem quite happy with its 3-star rating. So don't expect too much! Main cabin extra is excellent and as my husband is a permanent gold card holder we were able to select these at no extra cost. The seats are wider and very comfortable. The extra legroom is a bonus. Everything else is as in economy. The IFE on the -300 is very swish with a large screen and huge content a marked improvement over the -200 and the 767. I've always found that if you are nice to the staff they are nice in return and this was the case on this flight. The service was prompt and efficient the food acceptable and staff were present throughout the flight. Take off and landing were about on time. Be nice keep your expectations reasonable and its ok.
3307,I booked a flight from LAX to Raleigh-Durham NC. 24 hours before the flight I went on the AA web site to 'Check- in' and obtain my 'Boarding Pass'. When I selected the option to check-in I was asked if I wanted to select a seat. I elected yes and was presented which several options for only 'Paid Seats' at $86/per seat. Thinking there were no other options I selected a seat and paid the $86 for both the departing and return trips. After making and paying $172 for seats the web site asked if I wanted my boarding pass. I said yes and I was offered the option for seat selections that required no extra fee. Feeling set-up wondering why I was not offered options for all available seats from the beginning I called the AA Customer service group and the agent informed me that they could not do anything about changing my seat to one that did not require an extra fee. I then wrote them to ask why I was lead into believing I could only purchase a seat when free seats were available they simply said 'you made the decision to purchase the seat and therefore there is nothing that can do'. After this frustrating experience on the outbound flight I requested a 'bloody mary mix' just after the stewardess handed one to the stewardess covering the first class group. I was informed that they no longer had any more. Things on the return flight were equally as bad. I was unable to print a boarding pass - web message said my reservation had been cancelled. When I attempted to call the customer service group at 11.00 pm EDT the auto attendant informed me that wait time to talk with an agent was 35 minutes. Needless to say after these experiences I will never fly this airline again.
3308,MIA-LHR 16 June 777-200. Used miles to upgrade from economy. Call centre staff very helpful with this. Our flight didn't have enough upgrades available for both of us but she checked the next flight and found two. We paid a small extra charge to change flights in addition to the usual miles and co-pay but well worth it. We were originally returning on the -300 so a bit disappointed. The 2-3-2 configuration is now old hat as are the seats. American made a big mistake not going for fully flat bed seats when they bought the -200 and the angle flat seats are very out of date. Having said that they were very comfortable with huge legroom. The angle is not as bad as some I've been on though and I managed several hours sleep overnight. Lots of space and a bit of room for your bits and pieces. Service was rushed on takeoff which I assume was because the flight left at 21.20 and they wanted to allow everyone to sleep as soon as possible. Lights were out before we asked for coffee and cognac but staff willing to continue serving us as long as were wanted. Staff were visible all night as far as I could see. Be nice to the staff and they will usually be nice to you. Almost always works as it did on this flight. Food was only average certainly not what I expect for business class - grossly overcooked steak destroyed broccoli thing and something else I couldn't identify. Breakfast was a lovely omelette but it came with another grossly overcooked and dry bit of steak. It was all well presented and served however with good crockery flatware and glass wine glasses. Interesting that they did trolley service rather than tray service I have previously had on American. IFE on the -200 is dated with a reasonable screen size but limited selection of movies. It broke down at the beginning of the flight and it took a very long reboot to get it going. Certainly not up to the standard on the -300. Bose noise-reducing headphones a great idea but they are collected an hour before landing. The map feature showing flight progress etc didn't work for the entire flight. American is not trying to be one of the significantly better Asian or Mid East airlines so don't expect it to be. Keep expectations reasonable and you will likely enjoy the flight. I did.
3309,LAX-LHR. Business check-in at American's terminal at LAX is a joke. 1 person to check in everyone while 2 customer service agents hang around telling us 'they're going as fast as they can'. Security was in a tiny airless room - I couldn't quite believe this was the entrance to the terminal. Once through we passed the main spacious security check-in - it was closed. At the Admirals Club things started to look up: it's large with friendly bartenders and table service for drinks. Surprised to be restricted to 2 drinks coupons though. I'm guessing it's because there are domestic passengers in the lounge too. The plane was at a remote stand so we had to take a bus out to it - this surprises me as you would have thought that LAX-LHR was a premium route and American would want to encourage passengers. On board the cabin in business class on the 777-300 is exceptional - probably best across the Atlantic. Huge seats comfy flat bed great IFE plenty of drinks and ok food. Cabin crew friendly enough. Easy to sleep on this plane. There was a delay due to a sick passenger on the incoming flight and then a minor maintenance issue - all the movies were on so we drank and watched films. Breakfast was plentiful and really fresh. Sorry to get off at LHR!
3310,We have just completed a round trip from the UK to USA two transatlantic flights and three internal flights. The first from London to Dallas was characterised by dreadful food (lunch being served immediately after an early morning take-off!) with very unfriendly and ungracious staff. The second flight from Dallas to El Paso was delayed for an hour at El Paso where we sat on the tarmac for an hour in temperatures of c.110F because of a failed air conditioning unit. Offered not so much as a glass of water. The delay meant that the car hire desk we were using was closed at El Paso. The second internal flight was from El Paso to Phoenix. This time the flight was delayed because the 'pontoon bridge' attaching the plane to the terminal was broken. Again we sat on the tarmac without refreshment. Again surly and uncooperative staff. We were sat at the back of the plane when drinks were finally offered there was very little choice left and no time to enjoy them. The third flight from Las Vegas to New York was relatively uneventful tho' with ungracious and charmless grumpy staff. The food on board was expensive terrible and tasteless. The final flight was delayed more than 2 hours at take off and just under two hours at landing. No staff would tell us what was going on the plane was changed and we were forced to split up our family seats and had to sit in different places on the plane. The food was inedible. Staff were not only surly but extremely rude. In all instances the planes were old shabby and dirty with worn through upholstery and carpets defective lavatories inflight entertainment was broken reading lights did not work fresh air vents that would not open or close and the worst cabin staff I have experienced.
3311,June 12 AA169 LAX-NRT F Class. Nowadays one has quite high expectations for International First Class while adequate American met none of those expectations. On all levels it met international business class standards and no more. Cabin crew was friendly but not very visible between meals. Better off in business on JAL United Singapore or even Delta. Quite a let down.
3312,June 11 2014 flight 1322 Liberia Costa Rica to MIA. Worst experience ever! On our return aircraft had an engine problem delayed flight for 4 hours missed connecting flight in MIA to NYC because of this issue. Arrived at MIA at 12am and next flight was at 6am upon leaving same engine issue flight delayed 2 more hours. On top of the fact that their aircraft's are not inspected they offer no food not even a bag of chips and there's no wifi even though they say they provide it. I travel twice every year will never fly with them again!
3313,I just completed a multi city international round trip with American. 2 international flights and 3 domestic. So the international (from South America to Miami) was an overnight flight. The plane was old and the ceiling TVs stayed on all night. No sleep. All of my domestic flights were either delayed re-routed or cancelled. The first from Tampa to DFW was cancelled due to no oxygen. To top it off at my final destination back in South America one bag was delayed (hopefully not lost) as it was accidentally put on a LAN flight to Lima. 5 days later I am still waiting for it.
3314,"I flew from Manchester Airport to JFK in economy class. From the start the aircraft was very dated and did not smell particularly clean. The food was dull unappetising and almost thrown at you by the staff drinks were not offered except with the meal I had to beg a member of staff for a bottle of water on the journey. The IFE was very poor the TV was attached to the ceiling above the aisle so from my window seat I couldn't see the full screen so didn't get any IFE. On the return journey the same 4 episodes of ""Salvage Hunters"" was shown on a loop so repeated 3 times during the 7 hour flight. The seats were uncomfortable and very cramped on the return flight the passenger in front had his seat back which meant for a very claustrophobic journey. The most startling aspect to flying with American Airlines was the rudeness of the staff! I went to the toilet and an exiting a member of staff had started serving lunch she kept shouting at me to not stand close to her (which I was not) and in the end marched me to my seat and demanded I ""sit now"". On the return I had to plead for a drink only to get a very aggressive member of staff thrust a can of juice at me before saying ""now go sit down"". After booking with BA I was disappointed to find AA codeshare and operate the flight as I was not prepared for the awful aircraft used the lack of IFE the poor quality food and the stunningly nasty approach by the cabin crew. Would never choose or recommend this airline."
3315,We started in BWI with 4 delays totalling 4 hours. We finally made it to DFW and have been sitting on tarmac for almost a half hour now just a perfect end to horrible trip with AA. Tried calling customer service with a seat issue before flight and the woman hung up on me. I actually got 2 voice messages on the first 2 delays. I will not fly AA again.
3316,We booked a quick weekend round trip from MIA to ORD and the trip went very well! We had requested wheelchair service both ways and they were on time and very professional. From the counter staff to the flight crew Thank you for your professionalism and courtesy.
3317,Upon arrival at DFW airport my flight was supposed to depart at 10.20 pm. The flight was delayed several times and finally canceled at 12.00 am. Hotels were not offered the only option was to sleep in the airport. The next flight to my destination was scheduled for 7.30 am the following morning. At 7.20 am the next morning we learned that they had no pilot for the flight delayed again. I am very dissatisfied with AA customer service and I will no longer be flying with this company.
3318,Flew ORD-MIA on April 20th. The overall experience was very average. We flew American with miles and because United's flights to South Florida are infrequent and poorly timed and AA has a lot more options. All crew that I encountered didn't seem like they cared. The flight arrived on time and bags were waiting that the carousel. The aircraft flown was a 737-800 and the seats were surprisingly comfortable. Wifi was very good and it was only 7 or 8 dollars. The north terminal at Miami is very long and if you are making a connection allot extra time.
3319,"I just took this trip in fact I arrived back home last night. The trip out: went online to get boarding passes had to choose my seats (two flights). I chose my seat for the first flight no problem. Chose my seat for the second flight: $28 later I had both boarding passes. Silly me I expected when I bought my ticket that I would have a seat without paying extra not so I was in a so called ""upgrade"" seat which I didn't ask for nor did I want but that was all that was left. I did not get anything extra for having paid for a so called ""upgraded"" seat. I had to do the same thing on the return trip. Also you have to pay for your luggage. On the return trip I purchased a sandwich for $9.99 which was most definitely the worst sandwich I have ever had. I will fly Southwest when in need of a flight you purchase a fare from them you not only have a seat that you don't have to pay extra for your first bag is free."
3320,I normally fly Southwest exclusively - so you can imagine the culture shock when I found myself booked (by my company) on an American flight from SFO to JFK. The only thing I can say positively is that the food was really fantastic quite unexpected for in-flight cuisine. The drinks also came very consistently. The crew were not unpleasant but not quite up to the standards of the Southwest culture. And for a completely redesigned seat the Business Class seat was the most uncomfortable thing I have endured. I am 5'1 so my feet never touched the floor. I tried every adjustment on the panel but nothing worked. Finally I just used my provided pillow to stuff behind me to make my feet touch the floor. Between that and the leg rest I was able to get a little sleep on the way home. There was no indication of how to use the video screen in front of me or any explanation of how to operate the headphone (where the jack was located etc.) or anything. I stopped flying American about 12 years ago and now I remember why.
3321,JFK-LHR-JFK on BA return on code share AA flight on a new 777-300 so opportunity to compare the two airlines. The seats on AA far more comfortable than on BA greater privacy with 1-2-1 configuration free access without having to step over the neighboring passenger plus all seats facing forward something I never liked on BA set up with window seats facing backward. Inflight entertainment beats BA in every respect screens double the size appeared to be HD greater choice of movies. Food was delicious well presented good choice of wines. Ice cream sundae elevated the meal to a guilty decadence. Overall great experience and highly recommended.
3322,LAX to Phoenix. We were really unhappy with the customer service of American Airlines employees at LAX. We had a flight coming into LAX run really late and were bumped to a later flight the next day. We arrived to the airport at 8.00 and our flight to Phoenix was departing at 9.25. I usually arrive to airports about 1.5 hours before a domestic flight and this is usually plenty of time. We checked in at the kiosk but the computer would not print the bag tags. We grabbed an airline employee who directed us to a baggage check line for others with issues with the printing. It was only four people deep so we were not too worried. After about 20 minutes and the line had barely moved we started to become nervous. We tried talking to a couple agents about taking our bags from us and sticking them on a later flight so we could still make it to our gate. They were all at the most apathetic and kept telling us there was nothing they could do. By the time we finally got to the counter we had been in line 45 minutes. There were two employees working this whole time even though the process seemed to be incredibly slow. This inefficient system and lacking customer service caused us to miss our flight. Maybe I would think this was normal airline behavior but we have flown with Alaskan airlines in LAX when a connecting flight caused us to come in late. Their employees were very helpful took our bags and sent them on a later flight and even pushed us through security to ensure we made the plane. In the end I will never chose American again if I can help it.
3323,Upon checking in at my starting location I was informed by the AA rep that my flight was being delayed an hour to leave for O'Hare which was a problem as my connecting flight was to leave an hour and 10 minutes after arriving at O'Hare which turned into one mess up after another which would have had me reaching my final destination 2.5+ hrs after scheduled. I reached O'Hare (more delays) and eventually walked out of the airport and took a charter bus reaching my destination before the flight even left Chicago! Avoid American Airlines travelers.
3324,"MIA to LGA flight. It started with a mechanical problem with the plane's intercom which they spent 2 hours trying to fix before looking for another plane. Another plane found boarded and headed to the runway around 7pm. We waited on the runway for 1.5 hours because of ""weather"" (even though other flights on the same route were taking off) then told we had to go back to the gate. One flight attendant then got into a screaming match with a passenger (extremely unprofessional) while I waited with an upset baby for 15 minutes in the roasting hot gangway because they couldn't find anyone to bring up the gate-checked strollers. Finally the ""weather"" was okay to allow us to leave but a new crew was needed we finally left around 11.30pm. And then because LGA was closed it landed at JFK instead. Nothing positive to say about this airline. To be avoided if at all possible."
3325,Business Class trip Tokyo to Dallas. Attendants were rude! It was 45 minutes after take off before we were given audio headsets and 45 minutes before landing they gathered them up. My husband's didn't work and it was a chore to get a replacement pair. We felt like we were intruding on their day! Beverage service was a joke. This was a 12 hour flight and we were given beverages 4 times. We flew first class on various Asian airlines and the service was excellent. I will not fly American again!
3326,I've been flying for over 30 years and I have never come close to missing a flight. In April 14 I travelled with American from Miami to Washington DC and their awful check in staff caused my group to miss our flight. There was a cut off check-in time of 9.13am and we arrived about 8.55am and were told not to go the counter but to use self- check-in. We did this and when it came to finalising the check-in the system cancelled our check-in. Again we went to the oh-so-friendly staff which said go to the counter as it will be quick and there is not queue. Went to the counter and by the time we had got through the queue we were 3 mins past our check-in time. The staff couldn't have carried less and just flat out refused to help even thigh it was their fault. We were told that we needed to book in 2hrs before the flight but not only was this not listed on our ticket but our pre-printed boarding passes had 9.13am. I've got no apologies form the company and was left with missing our afternoon in Washington.
3327,May 30 - AA90 daytime flight ORD-LHR. 767-300. Boarding delayed as 15 min before scheduled departure the plane was just coming to the gate. Gate agents were horrible - that is the only part of the trip that was bad. Flight boarded quickly and pilot apologized for the delay. Flight attendants in economy were really great - friendly and prompt to respond to requests. Breakfast was french toast and there was a lot of food provided - I was surprised as usually breakfasts on AA Int'l are small. 2 movies shown on the overhead monitors - this is where AA fails without excuse. These planes need AVOD in each seat - end of story - period. But the service made up for it. Left Chicago 45 min late - arrived London 15 min late. Bags were already there when we got out of immigration. Good flight and service. The Purser was amazing also - helping out in both cabins and very friendly.
3328,American is the worst airline I have been on. I'm sitting in the plane after boarding in Chicago having to de- board due to an oil leak after 30 minutes waiting the maintenance have the all clear took off then the pilot came over the speaker saying we need to turn back land and de-board again switch gates then it gets delayed for an hour after they told us there was an immediate plane waiting. By far the worst and stressful experience I have ever had. I will never fly with American again.
3329,"LHR-DFW-SNA and return-first leg B773 very comfortable and on time AA gave us an unexpected and unasked for complimentary upgrade to MCE (very much appreciated). FA's were excellent second leg B738 was delayed by 2 hrs by storms at DFW scattering aircraft and crews everywhere AA performed miracles getting crews together. Return was on new B738 no complaints whatsoever everything to schedule however DFW-LHR on B772 was delayed approx 70 mins due to passengers trying to stow ""hand luggage"" larger than our hold luggage but again flight crew must've put the pedal to the metal as only arrived 15 mins late. Did not as one of life's great sleepers use the IFE on any legs and do not have any great expectations on airline food so wasn't disappointed."
3330,We flew from Las Vegas to JFK New York on 23rd May this year with American Airlines and we have never encountered such rude and unhelpful flight attendants. It was a 4.5 hour flight and they only came round with the drinks trolley once at the beginning of the flight and when I asked for some water was told that she wasn't there to run round after me! I was horrified but told her that I would follow her down to the galley and get my own water so she stormed off and brought me one back. The whole flight she was abrupt and rude. There were 6 of us in the party on holiday in 3 separate cities in USA. That was the only one where we encountered rude and nasty staff.
3331,LHR-LAX. After reading about the new business class cabin on American's 777-300 we decided to book our trip with them. We made a great choice. At Heathrow there is a separate 'flagship check in' outside the main terminal which was quick calm and very quiet. The Admiral's Club at LHR is disappointing - more like a cafe/canteen with strip lighting. Anyway once on board the cabin was great - the seats are a winner with a real feeling of privacy the screen is huge and there's a big choice of films and the food was good. Crew warmed up after a while and responded well to all requests. The walk-up bar had loads of snacks and was topped up throughout. Flight was on time. Remote stand a bit of pain but I understand this is due to construction. Definitely recommend.
3332,MXP-JFK return in economy. Boeing 767-300 was comfortable and silent service just okay seats cramped food too limited for a long range flight both inbound and outbound. Inflight entertainment just OK. Asked for upgrading purchase on return flight at check-in and was told from AA lady at counter the price was USD 7000 one way - unbelievable what a joke! Avoid AA from Milan fly Delta or Emirates.
3333,Boeing 777-300 GRU-JFK First Class. True waste of money or miles until crew's sense of premium service matches product. Last night First Class service in my flight was a joke : from the warm champagne to the traffic of crew members congregated in the service area socializing quite loudly in the middle of the night; to the dirty wine glass. Unpleasant main dish and Breakfast service so rushed that it felt as if it was coach. Do not seat in 2A as crew will bother you with the curtain hitting your seat every time they march between cabins (all night long). Great product but substandard service. Stay in business.
3334,The food was ghastly. Dallas Fort Worth to London breakfast was a measly white bread bun bare on the tray (no plate or even plastic) with butter and cheese with a small tub of yoghurt and a small orange juice. The dinner chicken tasted awful. The service from the cabin staff was abrupt and short. Some hand wipes at meal times would be great as the toilets left much to be desired. Also at meal times they would not remind passengers to put their chairbacks up like the attendants on the other airlines I mostly use. I think Qatar Airways is doing itself a disservice by aligning with American Airlines on code share flights. I particularly booked with Qatar Airways as their service is always impeccable.
3335,If there was a way to rate this company's service to a score less than 1 I would do that. I booked my flight all confirmed connecting through Chicago. In Chicago after a gate change and an hour delay they cancelled the flight to my destination. No options no direction just cancelled. Then after 30 min on the call I talked to them for rebooking. Nothing available. I got someone at a kiosk to help and they booked me on a flight 2 DAYS later whereas I had to be at a conference the next morning. Needless to say that was not an option. I rented a car and drove 10 hours straight to my destination getting to my destination at 4am. Then it is time to get back home and they tell me they have canceled my return ticket because I did not complete my trip. No warning no notification nothing. Just cancelled. So I had to pay for another ticket to get back home. There were many people like me on that plane. People from across the world who couldn't even speak English and they were lost and confused. I ended up helping one of them. There is no excuse for this. This is the worst none customer service oriented company I have ever dealt with. Avoid this airline by all means even if you have to pay a little more to go with another airline.
3336,"We flew Toronto to Chicago; paid almost $700 per ticket which was very expensive considering it was an 1.5 hour flight. When we booked the flight we thought it was through WestJet as it was advertised that way but in small writing at the bottom it said operated by American Airlines which we didn't see when we booked the flight otherwise we wouldn't have booked it. We had a very bad experience with AA a few years ago and refused to book any more flights with them. This time both flights were delayed. When returning they had oversold so my sister and I volunteered to take a later flight. That wasn't the issue. The issue was the incompetence of the staff; it took them an hour and a half to figure out how to give us our vouchers which is ridiculous because they told us we couldn't leave the gate until they gave us the voucher so we couldn't even go and have dinner or anything. On top of that the rep there kept saying she had no idea what she was doing and this was her first time doing vouchers - then get someone who knows what they're doing rather than wasting an hour just trying to figure it out yourself doesn't give us a lot of confidence in your abilities. Other issue was that they kept changing the gate to the flight (it was changed 4 times no exaggeration) and when we would go up to the desk to make sure it was there every person at the desk was extremely rude and one actually said to us ""can't you read the monitor?"" and when we explained that our ticket had a different number than what was on the monitor they gave us a dirty look and said that what they had was right (it wasn't in the end which is pathetic). it would be nice that if you were going to change the gates; at least inform people and let them know. Another minor thing was with the flight attendant she was grabbing something from the bin above my sister and her bag kept hitting my sister's head several times; and she wouldn't even apologize even though she saw it happening; she just gave us a look like how dare you sit there and be in my way when she was the one who was in our way. Very rude and terrible customer service. Will never fly again; I am not even going to use my voucher because that would mean I would have to travel again with this airline."
3337,"Was delayed out of DFW to SAT last night because after a long (DFW) taxi to the runway for take off we were informed that there was an issue with one of the computers. We were all curios as to why we got so close to being in the air before this ""issue"" was noticed - it is pretty obvious it wasn't Pilot error they completey felt our pain as did the flight attendants and gate workers. Of course we were re-booking a whole (S80) plane so it was obvius that we would have to wait for a plane to dead head. Fortunately that didn't take too long and we were just 2 hours late getting into SAT. Cudos to Capt Smith and his first officer for getting us home safely and the flight attendants that had to be dead on their feet undoubtably they all had a very stressful evening."
3338,Hope to never fly American Airlines again. I Was flying from Wichita KS to Dallas to my final destination Las Vegas on 5/18/2014. Our 3:00 flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Things happen so that was not a big deal how the situation was handled is my issue. All passengers with a connecting flight from Dallas was asked to stand in line there were about 40 to 50 passengers in line. There 2 American Airlines Rep working the counters needless to say they were very rude and short. They acted as if they were the one with the problem. They acted as if they did not care if the passengers found a connecting flight or not. I stood in line from approx 1:30 pm to 4:15pm well over 2 hours. Each Rep spent an average of 20 to 30 minutes per customer. At 4:15 2 more Reps appeared from the back however they did not have a clue what they were doing. The first guy told me that all Dallas flights were full and there was nothing available until the next morning and when I arrived in Dallas they would arrange for a hotel for the night. The person in line behind me; also going to Vegas was assisted by a different Rep who manage to find a flight for her and her 3 children. So I went back to the counter and spoke to a different Rep who was then able to find me a flight home that night. Needless to say this whole situation was very stressful and left a very bad reflection on American Airlines.
3339,"First and last time I will fly AA. Was ""bumped"" off original flight without being asked just told ""sorry you are now on next flight"". Next flight was supposed to be in 35 mins. I told flight attendant that if the flight was late I would miss my connecting flight she said ""sorry I don't make the rules"". Gentleman beside me said he would gladly wait for next flight as he didn't have a connection to make. She said ""no sorry"". Of course the flight was delayed and I missed my connection in Chicago. Once in Chicago I was told the next available flight was the next morning and no hotel or food voucher would be provided as it was an ""ATC"" issue not a AA issue on why there was a delay. What is ATC I asked - Air Traffic Control. AA had lots of people ""sleeping"" in O'Hare airport and it really was sad when you see seniors in wheelchairs having to sleep in their wheelchair because the cot they received was too low to the floor for them to lay down. Then the kicker is at 4am security is yelling wake up time to move along sleep time is over get moving. As I said first and last time I and many others will be travelling on AA."
3340,When we arrived at the airport all of the other airlines had fairly short check-in queues American Airlines filled up their queue and had a line going 30 yards down the hallway. It seemed that their computers must have shut down because the line wasn't moving. It took us two hours to get checked-in and check our bags. We would have been late for our flight but it was delayed anyway. The delay was over an hour and once we did get on the flight the seats were the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced. Our delayed flight caused us to only have 30 minutes to catch our connecting flight- which ended up leaving 10 minutes early (I am not making this up)- meaning we missed it. They issued us tickets for the next flight 3 hours later. We had confirmed seats on the ticket and everything but when we went to board the plane our tickets got flagged as invalid and we were told by the attendant that we were actually in standby- the plane ended up being full and we were not allowed on. So at this point my wife (7 months pregnant) is about to lose it and they tell us we can possibly fly out at 9 PM that evening. We do make that flight and arrive at our destination at midnight missing our evening plans and exhausting us. Again the flight itself was awful. I had taken 4 advil at this point and still had back pain. Never again American Airlines never again.
3341,"Connecting flight from Dallas to Knoxville cancelled for ""maintenance"". Customer Service agents were clueless and basically no help and really not concerned that the flight was cancelled. Stayed in airport for 5 hours attempting to get on another flight via standby with no luck. Once it was determined I was stuck in Dallas they provided vouchers for a place to stay (can't call it a hotel) and $19 worth of food with the next flight out the next day. After waiting for the shuttle for an hour we finally were on our way for a good nights rest or so we thought. Once we arrived it was obvious this was a pay by the hour motel called ""The Night Hotel"". Wow This place was basically a brothel built around a night club. The next morning we were waiting on our 5 AM cab ride to the airport and 4 prostitutes came walking through the door. Bottom line I can't believe American Airlines had the audacity to do what they did."
3342,"Cancun-Dallas Had a connecting flight from Dallas to Toronto which was delayed for several hours then ultimately cancelled due to ""a missing captain"". We had to re-book with an extremely rude and unsympathetic Customer Service Agent who told us that the next available flight was 10 am the next morning. We were traveling for a total of 36 hours. We were offered no compensation for the cancellation no apologies no Hotel or Meal vouchers. We had to sleep at the airport on a chair. Needless to say we will no longer ever use American Airlines to fly."
3343,LHR-MIA-LIM-MIA in economy. I expected a poor experience and with the exception of the first leg in the 777-300 they lived up to expectations. Old aircraft with technical issues on both MIA-LIM and LIM-MIA leading to delays in both directions inedible food unfriendly and unsmiling flight attendants dirty interiors cramped seating and no attempt to be of any help. Ate nothing as my vegetarian food requests had been overlooked/ignored (despite it being on my ticket) no apology or attempt to offer an alternative. Overall a very poor partner to BA. The score of 3 is awarded because of the LHR-MIA part of the journey only.
3344,American Airlines needs to work on their sensitivity to breast feeding mom's. They insisted I check my carry on suitcase b/c I was carrying a breast pump. Even when I consolidated my bags to 2 items they would not let me board without checking my bags. Nice!! Oh to be a professional man and not have to worry about airlines trying to put obstacles in the way of feeding your baby even when you travel for work.
3345,Toledo OH to Denver CO via one stop in Chicago (O'Hare) Trip to Denver had one delay of 3 hours at Chicago. May 7 2014 no reason given. Coming back snow storm in Denver delayed the plane takeoff by 1 hour not so bad. However when I got to Chicago the nightmare began. First flight to Toledo was delayed then cancelled. Reason who knows no 2nd pilot was the reason given. Got another flight time. Rain storm came. Two more flights delayed moved to different gate delayed then cancelled. What to do? No hotels taxi line 2 miles long. I left the boarding area so couldn't get back upstairs. Had to spend the night in a hard chair. Finally had to book a flight to Fort Wayne Indiana so I could get home. No flights to Toledo. What a nightmare experience!
3346,Chicago ORD to Boston. They got me to where I wanted to go at a reasonable time at a reasonable price. Can't blame American for the delay. I didn't expect free food or free alcohol. B737-800 was fine and so was the crew.
3347,Worst customer service I have had. My flight was cancelled today due to reasons that the airline had no control over but the customer service was awful. I was at O'Hare in Chicago flying to Phoenix and departing at 11.35. I left the airport today in Chicago feeling like I got stranded with no help and to fend for myself. I have never had a cancelled flight and didn't know what to do. I followed everyone else and waited to speak to an agent in line for almost 2 hours. When it was my turn to speak to someone they closed the line down and said we needed to go to the booking desk. I had no idea where that was and tried to ask. After being ignored one of the agents snapped at me and told me they couldn't help me unless I was flying to Dallas. They wouldn't even direct me on where I needed to go. I will never fly this airline again after I finally get home tomorrow. Worst customer service I have ever had to deal with.
3348,"Flew May 13/14 2014 ONT-DAL-DTW. This was the worst flight experience I've had. The plane in ONT was delayed 5 hours due to maintenance causing nearly everyone to miss their connecting flight out of DAL. We had to wait in line (I waited 1.5 hours) at ONT to get on a new connecting flight out of DAL. The seats on the plane out of ONT were tiny old creaky and uncomfortable and staff were disinterested and unfriendly. There was no ""inflight entertainment"" to speak of. The worst came however when we arrived at DAL. Immediately upon disembarking we were informed that ""there are no hotel rooms left in Dallas"". The customer service reps feebly tried to console people with Nature Valley granola bars and cheaply-made cots but everyone was in a mostly miserable mood. I and many others ended up trying to sleep on chairs through the night. Very few people got any sleep. Terrible experience all around. The last time I fly American."
3349,I flew from JFK to LHR with my family on 9th May. I was very pleased with the flight experience. I value a good entertainment system more which this Boeing 777 had with personal power outlet than the quality of food. There are restaurants at JFK that offer various choices. The irplane is not a restaurant. Food is a + but my values are on the seat comfort more. Seats were comfortable. Service was very efficient and fast. I also liked the dimmed cabin. Only bad thing was that the AC fan was on a quite heavy mode. Crew were mostly very friendly.
3350,Traveling from Miami to Santo Domingo arrived at the airport approximately 1.5 prior to departure. First you have to queue to help yourself at one of the self-service check in machine. After waiting for approximately 10 minutes we go through the check in procedure experienced some problem and had to get help from the staff member at the check in station. In the end we were unable to check in and were asked to go to the customer service counter. The staff member at the counter asks us to wait and disappears for 5 to 10 min and when he returns he advises us that we are now to late to check in luggage as it is less than an hour before departure and we are talking about 10 minutes now. He advises us that we can fly but our luggage cannot. Only option is to take a flight the next day pay $120 to change the flight and pay for another night in a hotel. The main issue here is the rude attitude of the staff. We can accept that there are rules to be followed but the attitude of the staff is a disgrace. AA have never been a great airline but this experience is by far the worst we have ever experience with any airline. We will do our very best to avoid flying AA again.
3351,"LHR-DFW-XNA AA51 transatlantic then American Eagle. I had avoided American Airlines transatlantic for years but thought to give the ""new"" American a try. Boeing 777-300ER already showing wear and tear in First Class. Cabin was dirty and food was inedible. Also the logic of serving lunch/dinner on an 09.30 flight utterly defeats me. Why not serve lovely breakfast? Crew was keen to get meal service over and disappear for the remainder of the flight. Flight diverted to IAH due to low fuel / weather but almost no announcements from flight deck. On American Eagle flight attendant was rude and not professionally dressed; She wore a crumpled uniform and believe it or not Dutch-style clogs. Overall it is so sad that there is no sophistication nor manner / culture at the ""new"" American Airlines. Travel on American Airlines is nowhere close to a First Class experience. This is a desperately poor airline but there isn't much choice across the pond sadly. Avoid this carrier if you can."
3352,We took this airline from Raleigh to London because we expected a similar service to BA with which it codeshares. Unfortunately we were so wrong! There is firstly no modern inflight entertainment system for economy class and the food was dreadful. Onboard service was rushed and not very friendly and to top it all we had one of the flight attendants talking loudly with passengers at the back throughout the whole night. Of course that meant that even without entertainment there was also no sleeping for those of us unlucky enough to be in this attendant's vicinity.
3353,LHR to JFK thinking I was traveling on British Airways flight BA1506 only found out I was flying on a codeshare flight with American Airlines AA105 when I got to the airport. Check in was efficient and friendly and the flight was uneventful except for the crew who made the whole experience feel very uncomfortable. I have never experienced cabin crew like it. Its a given that everyone has an off day once and a while but some of the crews interactions with the passengers that I witnessed were uncalled for. Crew were short unfriendly disinterested and deliberately ignored some passengers. At one stage I was made to feel like a huge inconvenience when I asked for a paper towel to dry up some water I accidentally spilled. In the end I had to queue at the toilets as I was informed I was capable of getting my own towels as the crew were busy. When we landed and were disembarking the crew thanked me for flying the New American Airlines. I don't know why BA codeshare with this airline as the service standards are at complete opposites of the scale. When I book my next flight I will make sure I know what airline I'm flying so I'm not on a code share with AA.
3354,"April 24th from MSP-DFW-SAN. No major complaints in-flight arrived close to on time. I was concerned when I was unable to check in online so I emailed customer service and they apologized for the issues they were having with the American/US Airways merger. It was all good as I was able to check us in and print our boarding passes at the airport kiosk (even though the message when I tried to check in online said ""see agent at airport""). All in all a fine experience. My next flight will be on Spirit Airlines so wish me luck."
3355,Worst airline I have flown with. American Airlines should be branded a budget airline. Flew from JFK to LHR and the experience was beyond belief. Firstly I was charged an arm and leg for excess weight off my bag. Secondly the staff on AA should get training serious training and customer service skills. The food is almost non existent seats are worst in class and the TV's are approx 4inch which are well scratched and used!
3356,I just returned from a trip from Seattle WA to Punta Cana DR and back. I told my husband after the first plane that I would never fly American again. It was 3 planes there and 3 back. The seats were the most tiny and uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. I am 5 ft 2 and 115 lbs so by no means am I a big person. The staff were awful. I have never met people so disinterested and rude. When leaving Punta Cana we sat in line for 1.5 hours because there was no one there to check us in! Every other airline were getting people through. We made it to our flight in the nick of time. We got there at 4am and didn't get to the plane until 6.25 and it left at 6.50. They were almost done boarding. I do not recommend this airline.
3357,From Sacramento to Dallas 4 of us booked our trip in early January. Final destination Paris France. We tried to select seats but arrived to find our seats changed. None of us together and 1 was the very back where it was so very noisy the flight was miserable. In Dallas we switched planes (again operated by American Airlines) what was supposed to be a 2 hour layover became an 8 hour layover. The legroom was non existent and when the people in front of us tilted chairs back we could hardly move for 10 hours. miserable. I will not support American Airlines to Europe or even to Dallas. I am not sure if they have just gone downhill or what. I must commend the fellow passengers for their tolerance of such a crummy flight.
3358,DFW to MOB flight AA2981 and AA3377 MOB to DFW. On our round trip flight so far 2 of the 3 aircraft's have had maintenance issues resulting in delays missed connections and waiting on standby. We have yet to hear a single apology.
3359,CDG-ORD-BWI operated on a Boeing 767-300 and an Embraer 145. I have Gold status on AA so I was able to obtain a Main Cabin Extra seat on the first flight free of charge and an exit-row seat on the second flight. The ground experience at CDG was okay and they were pretty well organized. The first flight took off on-time although we had to board by bus (something that probably irritates every passenger). Cabin crew were okay and there was no IFE which I knew to expect even though practically every other carrier has it by now. The connection at ORD was amazingly painless and security was a breeze. The Eagle flight was delayed due to a late inbound aircraft but we landed a mere 30 minutes behind schedule and my checked bag was waiting for me on the carousel just 10 minutes or so after landing. All in all fairly satisfied.
3360,Tampa to Chicago O'Hare on 28 April. Check-in was fast but very unfriendly. Cabin crew were unfriendly and uninterested. Plane was cramped and service was almost non-existent. Only thing offered was soft-drinks. No hot drinks snacks or food available which is pretty poor for a what's scheduled as a 3 hour flight. No entertainment on offer the flight got me from A to B but that's about it. I've had better service on Ryanair. Not a great addition to the Oneworld Alliance.
3361,"I am currently sitting at LAX airport and having the worst experience I had with an airline. I arrived in LA this morning by Qantas from Perth-Sydney and upon going through the ""Express Connection"" I was informed by one of the ground crew members that I would be required to take my luggage and check-in inside the terminal. When I arrived in the terminal I was sent by American Airlines employees to 3 different places to try to drop-in my baggage. When I finally arrived in the last spot (45 min prior to flight schedule time) I was informed that I wouldn't be able to check-in my bags nor take them in the cabin despite having had checked-in on-line prior to going to the airport. She them put my wife and me in ""stand-by"" list for a flight 2 hours later and checked our bags-in. I was placed in second in the list at that moment (again according to the front desk lady because I am a ""One World Sapphire Member"" and would be put in front of other people in similar situations. In the half hour preceding the boarding time our name had escalated to 6th and 7th on the list. I tried to (very politely) speak with the lady at the boarding desk 3 times but she in each time she rudely answered ""Stand-by I will be with you in a second!"" In the end she suggested that one of us should take a remaining seat and the other wait for the next flight. We decided to do that as the next flight seat wouldn't be warrant as well. Everything was dealt in a rush/unplanned manner showing AA have no control to handle such situations. Now I am here hoping to not get bumped again or get stuck in LA for the night after 16 hrs flying from Australia then meet my wife at my destination and go to the hotel to have a rest. This was my first flight with AA and certainly the last one."
3362,MEX-DFW-YUL Business Class. We were lucky enough to get a discounted fare so that Business Class was a bit cheaper than the economy class fares available. On the MEX-DFW leg plane was an old and a bit worn out MD80. Good flight with a really kind and helpful flight assistant who spoke a perfect Spanish. I don't fly AA often but I must admit that I've always found nice and smiling staff both in business and economy class. Good to know that if you have an international connection via DFW you no longer need to retrieve and recheck your baggage to your final destination. We went through immigration very fast and headed for the Admiral's Club which is really disappointing: no snacks except for cookies only 1 alcoholic drink per person unfriendly staff. On the bright side wifi was good and the view on the tarmac was excellent. The DFW-YUL leg was on a newer 737 and it was an uneventful flight with a good lunch but a very poor selection of drinks. Nice staff.
3363,I flew from San Francisco to Heathrow on April 26th and found the airline crew working in economy to be both unfriendly and unprofessional. The most senior of the crew had an abrupt manner I noticed on more than one occasion her behaviour towards passengers who accidentally happened to get in her way in the galley area there was no politeness shown in terms of politely asking them to move but eye rolling and heavy sighing. My pillow happened to fall into aisle without my knowledge and I was reprimanded by this senior crew member for allowing this to happen! The crew whilst serving beverages/food would not engage in any conversation or pleasantries with passengers instead they would look right through you if you smiled at them they would not smile back when I exited the economy area on leaving the plane a couple of the crew stood near the exit area and there was again no pleasantries or smiles just silence. Only on leaving the plane did a friendly crew member who I believe had been working in First Class or Business Class speak to me and said 'thanks for flying with us have a good day'. I have flown with many airlines and I have to say that my return flight home with AA was the worst experience I have ever known and because of this I will not be flying with AA again. AA show a video to their passengers before a flight which promotes the technology investments they have made in relation to improving the customer experience. I would recommend to AA that they focus more attention and investment into the training of their crew to provide a better service to their customers.
3364,"Flew MIA-BCN business class. I am a long user of AA but always inside the US or from Venezuela to US. This is the first time I took AA to Europe usually when going to Spain I use Iberia. I had very low expectations but must say I was impressed. This flight was on the o767 the cabin in business is the ""old business class"" with seats that do not lie flat but I must say that it was comfortable enough to take a 4 hour sleep. Amenities kit nice and pretty. No private screen but a Samsung tablet was provided not a huge a mount of options but it was more than Ok. The biggest surprise? Food was excellent and in amounts that I have never seen before in other Business class. Plenty of bubbly. Service extraordinary FA's smiling and helpful."
3365,AA flight 1612 from Phoenix to Dallas/Fort Worth was great. Plane was only 1 year old flight servers were fantastic and funny excellent beverage service and communication from captain to passengers polite timely and sincere. Really liked the comfort of the plane extra leg room soft comfortable seats and inscreen TV monitor.
3366,Flew DFW to FRA on 777. Crew was very helpful. Nice entertainment. Good food! This is one of the best airlines in the US.
3367,LGA-PBI April 19th 2014 was overall great. Flight was on time and we even landed early. The crew of flight attendants and pilots were nothing great flight attendants didn't give much personal attention to the passengers it seemed. We were seated in Main Cabin Extra in the front row (8A8B8C). Main Cabin Extra is supposed to have 6 inches of extra legroom since we were seated in the front with the bulkhead in front of us which is really just a wall for those of you who don't know it did not feel like we had 6 inches of legroom and it felt very cramped through the whole area. If you are about to pay extra money for main cabin extra avoid the first rows which is row 8. I'm not sure about 8D 8E 8F but I assume it's the same. Also the tray tables are considerably smaller because they are stowed in the arm rest. But they are kind of cool to an airline enthusiast like myself because it feels like a first class seat. We did not have to pay for Main Cabin Extra because my family had Gold member free Main Cabin Extra so for us it didn't matter but if you have to pay for MCE I would sit any row behind 8. All in all great flight and I love American they will always be my #1 airline to fly and I would still recommend flying them just not in row 8 MCE.
3368,My recent trip with American Airlines has made me become a United loyalist. I have sworn to myself to never fly American again. The horror started at the check-in at JFK. You'd think if there was a merger between American and US Airways that passengers could check in anywhere. No the quite literally 60 open and manned desks were for US Airways passengers only while the AA passengers had to get in line somewhere off to the side where there were two people working. On the plane a stewardess was sitting on the jump seat in the exit row and could not stop talking to a passenger in a very loud voice. Returning from LA the check-in procedure was hands down the most inefficient system I've seen in my life. Once boarded we had a plane from I don't know when but practically no one's baggage fit in the overhead compartment everyone had to check their bags and the whole thing delayed us by about thirty minutes. The stewardess must have elbowed me in the head at least a dozen times and woke me up once to ask if I'd like to drink something. No thank I was fine just sleeping. Never flying American again.
3369,Dallas to London in Business. The new AA cabin looks very good - spacious flat bed seats lots of storage and a big screen. However it was let down by slow service food that was simply not up to standard and the IFE froze and was not reset. AA has got the basics right but needs to work on the details.
3370,Several flights over the last month LA to Santa Fe Sioux a City Chicago Denver Las Vegas Lax Honolulu. All flights on time had preferred seating on all flights where available and could notice difference. Crew reasonably friendly although best crew LAX-HNL. Negative definitely good for purchase LAX-HNL Cheese and fruit not worth the money Turkey and & Chutney sandwich bread very dry and stale. Again not worth the money. American take a lesson from many International airlines and what they offer Economy passengers in a 5 hour sector. Would still recommend as a US Domestic carrier.
3371,If you have to fly with someone don't fly with AA. They made me check in my carry on luggage and were unable to open the undercarriage door making me miss my connector flight to Atlanta. I had to stay overnight in Chicago due to their failure. I asked two different employees for a Supervisor and both of them told me there wasn't one. I had to go to a different airline and they got me an AA supervisor. The own AA employees outright lied to me about a supervisor. They scheduled me on a 6am flight the next morning and yet again they had issues. They had defuelling issues on the plane and everyone had to deboard. They are now trying to get us on a different plane. Do not fly with this company unless you want to pay a lot of money for a ticket to arrive a day later and potentially lose your luggage. Worst airline I've ever used so far.
3372,Mediocre service. Just flew from John Wayne to DFW and the flight was freezing. I asked for a blanket and was told they don't have any only to see unopened blankets on every seat in first class. I guess only first class passengers are worthy of being comfort. That really irritated me after freezing for two hours to see that they could have very easily provided a blanket. Really poor customer service. To actually say they don't have blankets when they do and you then see them.
3373,"GRU-DFW in new 773. What a great and enjoyable flight. New plane comfortable seats excellent food huge movie selection and a wonderful crew. If this is the ""new"" American they have got it right!"
3374,NYC/JFK to BUE/EZE. Flights AA953/09Apr and AA954/14Apr. Both flights departed on time and both arrived early operated with B777-200 equipment. Check in procedures at both airports efficient and quick with smiles. Seat width adequate seat pitch could use an additional inch but seat cushion comfort rock hard and unacceptable! I saw nothing international about their heralded international flagship service. The dinners served in both directions were big on flavor/taste but small in serving size. The salad ex/NYC had seen better days but the salad ex/BUE was crisp excellent and fresh. Dessert ex/NYC was a tasty pre-packaged chocolate brownie but only a 'Bon o Bon' ex/BUE. What was referred to as breakfast on both flights was a warm croissant with butter and jam served with OJ and a fruit yoghurt ex/NYC and OJ a very fresh fruit salad ex/BUE. The catering ex/BUE was of a much higher calibre/quality than that out of NYC/JFK. On both flights the inflight cabin crews were efficiently friendly and served with smiles. Where AA really excelled was how they treated me as a WCHC wheelchair passenger. Everyone I came in contact with in both cities and inflight both AA staff and their handling agents treated me with care dignity and respect! Would have NO problem recommending AA to others for their air travel.
3375,Nothing wrong with the service or the food but on some routes such as Barcelona to New York the planes are old and do not have individual entertainment systems. This means you have to watch whatever film is being shown on the overhead monitors making for a very long trip. There is a huge amount of competition out there so unless AA/US Air get new planes I will not be flying with them again.
3376,Day trip from LGA to ORD First class. Never flown with AA before but was impressed. Lounges not as good as BA's but cabin crew delivered excellent service both ways. Outbound lunch was tasty chicken salad and cookies and dinner on the return was a tasty pasta dish with a dessert. Brandy and chocolates rounded it off very well.
3377,JFK-MIA-BOG round trip early-April 2014 in economy. American Airlines staff are consistently rude and grumpy. I am constantly surprised when once in a while there is a ground staff or cabin crew member who are actually polite and helpful.
3378,"American Airlines gave away our 3 first class seats on Flight 53 from MIA to DFW on Sunday April 13 despite the fact that we were at the gate 17 minutes before flight time. The agent had already left the with the standby passengers. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to AMA and to have to overnight at DFW. Also one of our party had to fly coach even though we purchased a first class seat. I used to worry that with the merger AA 's customer service would sink to U.S. Airs level. Now I'm afraid the ""new American Airlines"" will sink to an even lower level. They sent our luggage on to our final destination. I have lifetime Platinum status on AA for having flown over 2.2 million miles with them."
3379,Flew LHR to Miami on a 777 in the new business class. Seating very comfortable. It was a daytime flight so I can't comment on the seat for an overnight flight. Great service. Food very acceptable. IFE excellent. Lounge at LHR is adequate nothing more. Immigration officer at MIA was the rudest man I've come across in a long time but that's not AA's fault. Their pre-landing video suggests that the immigration staff are there to help - not!
3380,I just took a trip 2 weeks ago. Flew from Chicago to Dallas Dallas to El Salvador. We landed in Dallas with 27 minutes until our next flight was leaving so we ran through the airport made my flight and thought there is was no way our luggage made it! We were so excited when we arrived in El Salvador to find that all of our bags made it.
3381,"13 April 2014. AA1119 from Boston to Chicago ORD. AA1159 from Chicago to St Louis. There was a major delay due to the weather. So I checked with the crew at gate B30 before I board in Boston. She said AA1159 would also be delayed so it's ok. While I was checking my flight connection the other crew used the microphone and told everyone ""If you are woried about your connection don't be."" When we landed in Chicago I checked the gate for AA1159 via my phone status ""In Flight"". The gate was H11B so I went to the crew at H11A see what can they do for me. Since there were no more flights to St Louis they can only schedule me for the first flight the next morning. I asked where I could stay for the night told me I could stay at the gate or she could offer me a hotel for reduce rate. I decided to stay at the gate."
3382,Flight from LA to JAX via Miami was uneventful. Flight from JAX to Dallas was a total different story! Our flight left Florida at 7.20 am. After an hour in the air the captain announced we had to land urgently in Birmingham Alabama. Around 10 am they told us the mechanic was on the way and would take one more hour! By noon they announced there would be a plane coming from Dallas and should be in Birmingham by noon. We would be on our way and arrive at Dallas by 2.30 pm. I called an agent and was told there was only flight available leaving Dallas at 8.30 pm and arriving at LAX at 10.40 pm. We continued to wait and wondered what happened to the plane. The plane arrived in Birmingham at 3.00 pm. We were boarded by 3.20 pm. We were not moving for another two hours. Finally arrived to Dallas after 7 pm. Most of us had missed connecting flights and were told there would be an agent waiting for us at the gate to rebook our flights. There was no one waiting at the gate. I finally got on the next flight out of Dallas and felt lucky to be able to get on the 8.10 flight to arrive in LA at 9.40 pm. Arrived at LAX at 9.30 pm and told there was no gate available for another 20-30 min. We waited on the plane for 1 hr 40 min. I probably will not fly AA again.
3383,4/13/14. Flew from Rochester NY to Chicago. Plane was 45 minutes late due to weather taxiing from far reaches of O'Hare then no crew at taxiway. Missed our connection to Seattle. All flights overbooked so could not get on via standby had to stay overnight and pay for a hotel. Told our first class tickets through Travelocity were really Economy with instant upgrade we ultimately went coach 20 or so hours late. Never again. They did give us two $300 vouchers good for future travel within a year.
3384,We flew Heathrow to Puerto Rico 2 adults and 3 children under 12. When we tried to check-in online there were only 5 paid seats together - the others were scattered around the plane. Clearly we couldn't sit the 3 children on their own so we contacted AA and were told we'd have to pay the extra (£220) and book the paid seats which we did very reluctantly. When we checked in at the desk however we were told we couldn't have the seats we'd booked and were given 5 others which were a 2 and a 3. During the second leg of the trip we were given exit seats which were not allowed for children as we were told they would be 'a good bargaining tool' for swaps. On the return we couldn't sit at all near each other: 3 of us sat on the very back row and 2 at the front of the plane. However AA used BA as a carrier for the final leg - they had automatically allocated five seats together because we were travelling with children and allowed us onto the plane first - a completely different attitude from AA. I agree with former reviews - the seatbelt signs hardly went off on the AA flights which is unacceptable on long-haul. I have claimed a refund for the booked seats which we didn't get - am waiting to see if I'll actually get the money back.
3385,When we used to be able to fly through Chicago O'hare AA wasn't as bad. The last 12 times we've gone through DFW the plane sits on the runway after arrival for 30 minutes every time. This makes even an average time between connections tight. Then we get to our gate and the gate has changed while we're on the skytrain. And too often the flight is cancelled for no known reason. AA changes my seat unbeknown to me until check in which irks me. I do not care for the new 737s. All seats are 3+3 so there are no good rows and already tray tables are broken lights don't work and I don't think they fix them often. My husband is a 'top' platinum so he doesn't have some of the problems I do but he's not pleased anymore either.
3386,"Have lived outside the US for 20+ years. Have flown many long haul flights to European hubs and then on to different cities in the US. We usually fly on British Airways (great airline) or KLM or Delta. For the first time was forced (because of a change in flight schedules) to fly on American Airlines from DFW to London (Heathrow) yesterday. So many things wrong: seatbelt sign on for most of the flight despite only occasional mild turbulence. Not acceptable on a 9 hour flight. The flight attendants were not friendly or service oriented. They mostly communicated with each other and acted annoyed when interacting with passengers. or they just sat in the galley. On this long flight a request for another small bottle of water (in business class) was denied: ""Only one per customer"". They did not come around even once during the night to offer drinks. Unless there is no other choice avoid long-haul trips on this airline. The ground staff were a little better still not customer oriented."
3387,My husband and I have been trying to get home since 4/6/2014 we were booked on a flight at 4.10 after a one hour delay they cancelled it. We couldn't get booked on another flight so we had to stay over. They booked us on flight #2575 at 9.25 then overnight somehow we got cancelled even though we had recheck boarding passes. We were re- booked for a noon flight #2419. Then after being directed to 2 different gates and waiting in the airport for over 12 hours today 4/7/2014 our flights to Albuquerque were canceled. We were sent to 5 different gates during the 12 hours. 3 cancellations in 24 hours it's unacceptable customer service. We still don't know if we're actually going to have a plane at 8.20 flight #1285.
3388,My husband and I were on flight 2224 from Las Vegas on April 4. The airplane was an S-80. We flew first class and were very disappointed. The only difference between first and the rest of the plane was a wider seat and meal. The plane didn't have movies or music. Bare bones plane for sure. Also a constant stream of people walking from the back of the plane to use front lavatory. Also alcohol is plentiful if you drink however I wanted ice tea and that is not an option. Maybe they don't know that it is available in bottles or cans.
3389,Flew LHR-MIA. Seats are uncomfortable Inflight entertainment is below par. Overall its better just to avoid AA by all means.
3390,AA997 DFW-EZE on 4 April - First Class. Overall a great experience. The purser was very personable and professional. 777-200 plane which has seen better days - for a first class seat (that I will say was super comfortable to sleep in as it was totally flat and they give you a thin mattress which makes it much better) there were so many little tears and things that made the seat look tatty. Food was good - appetizer soup (great pumpkin soup) salad chicken and veggies and desert. In-flight TV on AA is always a joke compared to any other carrier - too few TV shows - too few updated recent movies - super small screen for a first class experience. But for the price and the overall service - AA wins on this flight. I have recently had a lot of flights and AA has been doing great. Keep up the great work!
3391,We flew in from Jamaica to Dallas Fort Worth Texas and our flight was delayed. The biggest problem was that there was little information given to passengers. After 2 hours we found out we were waiting for a crew to arrive from another destination. After being delayed 4 hours we finally got on the plane to sit on the runway for another 45 minutes. The pilot said we were being re-routed due to weather and did not have enough fuel and would have to go back to the gate to refuel. We reach the gate at 2am and wait to only be told the flight was now cancelled. This is where I truly get frustrated with the way things were handled. 150+ passengers are told their flight is cancelled but there is no other flights going into Louisville. You will have to find another way home or wait until Wednesday (6 days later)! We wait in line another 1.5 hrs to try and find a flight close to home willing to drive the rest of the way. The gate agents have been no help whatsoever it was 5.30 in the morning and they offered no cots or anything to us. There were no hotel rooms. They did give us a $12 voucher for a meal. Finally got a late flight almost 24 hours later to Cincinnati but now have to incur additional expense of renting a car to get home. Tried to get on a couple of standby flights but I have noticed that AA overbooked every flight and boots people off so stand by is a joke. Highly disappointed!
3392,Paid $1700 for two seats. Airline website would not allow us to choose seats at time of booking. Return a week later to book and lo and behold only paid seats left. Call Airline and told unless we pay and additional $170 per person we will have to depend on the kindness of others to move seats so we can sit together. This is absolute crap. If you can't book your seats at time of booking then don't buy the ticket unless you're willing to pay additional $$$ to actually get a seat.
3393,We flew from MCO via MIA to Punta Cana. The first leg was fine and for an hours flight every was completely satisfying. The second leg from Miami to Punta Cana was a total disappointment for my first international flight with AA. At the airport I was rejected to enter the lounge as for flights to The Caribbean the access is excluded. This logic I will never understand. The two flight attendants have been absolutely passive in their service and spent their time rather with making jokes with each other or actively ignoring requests such as a glass of water or getting visa documents. One flight attendant had his hands in his pockets at all times - while going through the aisle. I have never been so disappointed from a Business Class flight before. For sure AA will not have me as a customer onboard again and I am glad that there are a lot of options on the US flight market.
3394,AA 324 MCO-DFW in First. Flight on time pre-ordered snack delivered cheerfully pre-departure drinks offered. Inflight the Attendant could not do enough for everyone. Ordered 5 star connecting service and arrival service. Was met at the arriving gate at DFW and taken by golf cart to the Admirals Club in Concourse D. I was able to bypass the Admirals club check in line handed Premium Drink vouchers and told I would be greeted by someone else to take me to my next flight. Shortly afterward the weather turned horrible for about an hour. My new 5 star agent found me in the Admirals Club and asked if I had any questions. I had her check to make sure the plane taking me to Santiago Chile made it on the ground. She came back to confirm it was on the ground but waiting for a gate due to the weather. Near boarding time she collected me and carted me off to the gate. I was carted back to the Admirals Club and asked to be kept informed of the situation. I was collected again and informed the new plane was ready but they were under tight time constraints to get it going due to crew time restraints. AA's Flagship suite is comfortable the turn down service pyjamas slippers and kit were all very nice. The international crew in First save for one employee were polite but simply went through the motions. The food was decent. Filled out the Breakfast Card and awoke to a nice breakfast and a wonderful view of the Andes as the sun was rising. Despite the Delay in DFW good job by AA.
3395,"I arrived 4 hours early for my late afternoon flight to Orlando after my cruise. I was confirmed in Main Cabin Extra. Miami has always been a ""challenging"" airport but not having been there in over a decade it was a whole new challenge. My bag was 5 lbs overweight so I had to go buy a small personal carry item and remove 5 lbs from my bag. Needless to say a huge hassle. Since I checked in so early American did not offer to put me on one of the several flight before mine but they certainly did send my bag early as it was already in this huge mire when I arrived in Orlando. The security situation in Miami is a nightmare. Once finally through the drama the new terminal AA built was nice with allot more choices of things to do but it seemed gate after gate I passed no one cleaned up the trash left by the customers. Flight boarded on time I asked for some tissue got it promptly then only saw the Flight attendants during seat belt check before and take off and landing. They all seemed to pile into F class and offer multiple drink rounds. Main Cabin Extra is what AA Coach used to be minus the service. We arrived on time and my bag had been waiting hours for me. No complaints."
3396,I hadn't flown American since the mid-80s when the service varied between passive-aggressive and actively unpleasant. Things have improved since then. The service on two flights - business from Miami to San Jose and economy from Panama City to Miami - was fine and even friendly. But the entertainment food etc show less sign of change.
3397,6 flights with AA in the past month or two. JFK-MIA: Arrived at check-in counter on time. Staff were friendly enough and seemed to be at ease but maintained proper professionalism. Flight waited 20 minutes at the gate before taxiing because of some missing passengers. Nice well maintained 757 seats were comfortable although not the best and flight attendants were nice. Rather bad entertainment. 2 hour flight landed in Miami with no issues. MIA-MGA (Nicaragua): Had roughly a 2 hour layover until connecting flight was scheduled. Everything went smoothly no complaints there. Flight into Managua was a little worse - 757 was a bit dilapidated and we had about an hour delay before taking off. Staff at the gate upon landing pointed us towards our destination and were very welcoming. MGA-MIA-JFK: Return flight went well nothing really remarkable. Everything was on time staff were nice and helpful seats were alright. JFK-LHR: On one of the older 777-200ER aircraft. Staff very friendly and professional. One of the flight attendants even went as far as to sit down and conduct conversation with a few of the passengers during the flight and gave off a very good vibe. Throughout the 6 hour flight the flight the attendants came around frequently and often were available to provide passengers with snacks and drinks whenever prompted. Seats were surprisingly comfortable and the flight wasn't even half full so almost everyone in Economy had the chance to fully recline across the 5 seat middle aisle (One of the advantages of the 200ER over the 300ER). Meals were actually pretty decent and I had few complaints. Fairly good entertainment with a selection of about 30 films and 10 TV shows. Flight landed smoothly and we were quickly on our way through customs and security. LHR-JFK: The flight was a little more crowded but there was still room to switch seats and there were a few open middle aisles to lie down on. Lunch was a small pizza which wasn't too bad. Flight landed smoothly and there were staff at the door to greet us. Would fly again.
3398,I was traveling home from Palm Springs CA. through Dallas. Flight was delayed 3 times through e-mail notification before any gate agent was seen. When I asked the young lady about our flight she didn't know anything. After a couple of calls she made an announcement. All I wanted was some info so I knew what to do next. After boarding and taxiing to the runway we were told we did not have enough fuel to make it around the approaching storm. Then the flight was canceled and re-instated in about 15 minutes. After we did land 6 hours late in Shreveport I called customer relations and they were not helpful at all. I was offered $200 toward my next travel.
3399,23 March. JAX to DFW to connect with a BA flight back to LHR (comment later). Aircraft MD83. I took this flight with very low expectations following past experience and general comments. Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience. Check-in at JAX was swift friendly and cruised past security in no time; was offered Fast Track and then again JAX is not the busiest of airports in the US. Unfortunately there are no lounges for premium passengers unless you are flying DL or their Skyteam partners. Boarding was relatively ordered. Was greeted with a smile (first impression counts) and shown to my seat by the friendly stewardess. Unlike many European carriers on their shorthaul aircraft's the premium cabins in this case do have distinct seating in their different classes. For the type of aircraft and duration of flight I would say it was quite appropriate - no use expecting a flatbed or deluxe booth for a two hour + flight. Once boarding was complete announcements were made hot towels offered followed by a choice of bubbly juice or water. Lift off was on time and flight pretty smooth most of the time. A few bumps here and there but that's part of flying. Service was above my expectations the stewardess was extremely friendly helpful and fully justified the premium escence of the cabin. Main and only disappointment was the food. Not bad but certainly not a First Class offering. On shorter Asian and European journeys the offering is far superior in a comparable cabin. On the other hand being a nut-allergy sufferer the pre-lunch aperitif of warm nuts was a no-go for me however this charming lady went out of her way to get me an appropriate (and definitely yummier) substitute - corn chips with a houmous dip. Landing was a bit later than scheduled but beforehand I was explained the best way of getting to my connecting flight. Surprisingly and with a mere 40 minutes to spare my bag even made it to my connection. Well done American!
3400,Only drinks were offered on flight. Not even a bag of peanuts. The man beside us tried to buy food but said they were basically out and we were only a few rows behind business class. Flying from Toronto and connecting in Miami. Lost our luggage on our connection to Costa Rica. Had to wait 2 hours in Costa Rica airport for lost luggage and said would have it later that night delivered to hotel. Wasn't there the next day and had no idea where it was. No one would pick up the phone at the airport. Finally got it the following morning when we were at another hotel 4 hours away. First and last time.
3401,Everything was fine except they did not offer any food in Economy class (you have to pay for some poor snacks). Our flight was at lunchtime. The ticket fare was $500 you'd think they would manage to fit a sandwich or slice of pizza in the budget. The Business Class passengers were served snacks hot meals and free alcoholic drinks. Outrageous.
3402,Flight from RTB to FRA via MIA. Flight departed in Roatan 1hr delayed. After the immigration we missed our connection flight. So we had to rebook for the next day. Finding the airport shuttle to the hotel was very hard without any guidance. Rebooked flight to FRA via DFW was delayed for another hour so we thought it could get close again. So we asked for the gate for our connection flight. After reaching the gate we were told that this is the wrong gate and the flight is delayed or another three hours. All ground staff were rude and not willing to get us asap to FRA. The Entertainment system is not state of the art and sometimes not working. The crew were unfriendly. Food is a joke. Never again with AA.
3403,ORD-MIA on March 27. 737-800. Flight was packed and had Emergency Row window - my favorite seat 14F. Upon boarding F/A at door was all smiles - even joked with me while waiting for First Class passengers to get settled while I was at the door. Really fun group of FAs and all smiling. Flight was just about 3 hours and went by fast. Had cheese and crackers snack so not much but we all know the inflight catering in Economy is basically nothing so no complaints. Just bring your own food if you want something substantial. Nothing was shown on the TV's so not sure why - that's the only thing to really say was a let-down. Landed early and bag out quickly. Good job AA!
3404,"MIA-POS 28 March in Business Class. 757 had new seats and was 50% full so plenty of room. Departure was 1 hour late due to First Officer being 1 hour late to the flight (wasn't explained why but they kept us in the boarding area so we didn't have to sit on the hot plane). Flight attendants in Biz Class were great - super friendly and smiles. Purser came and greeted each passenger - and his partner FA was all smiles and anticipated your needs which was amazing. Food was really good - AA has changed its menu and very tasty and healthy. Flight was only 3 hours so went by quickly. Another ""Thanks for flying with AA"" from the Purser prior to landing. Keep up the good work American - really was excellent service."
3405,My husband and I travelled from San Juan to Miami and to Seattle. Nothing was offered in the form of snacks so forget about food. Such a long ride and the seats were very uncomfortable. We had to pay $25.00 for the checked bag. I don't understand how the airlines are getting so cheap. I looked online before I left and it said there would not be any charge for the checked bag. From Seattle to Atlanta and then to San Juan I travelled on the Delta Airlines and we were given snacks.
3406,MAN to JFK on British Airways ticket but American Airlines aircraft. Very old B757 aircraft that has not been refurbished. No seat back screens. Only two choices of meal (three on virgin Atlantic). Very average quality and small portion size. Dessert consisted of a couple of biscuits. Crew were pretty good. No complaints and flight was on time. Seating was cramped. Large number of seats converted to extra legroom but for a premium price.
3407,Flight #1361 BNA-LAX on 3/14/2014. 1st class AM flight and was offered Corn Flakes or Oatmeal? Isn't this 1st class. In this day and age I cannot believe this is the offering. Where is the fruit yoghurt or hot breakfast sandwich? Coach was offered nothing. Nothing to purchase not even a miniature snack of nuts. This was a 5 hour flight. I expect that length of flight to at the very minimum offer a meal that is available to purchase.
3408,Flew on an award economy ticket RDU-LHR-RDU a very convenient route if you live in NC/SC or Southern VA. Both flights on time the food edible the service efficient if not enthusiastic the seats cramped and uncomfortable. AA deploys a 767-300 on this route a fine 20th century workhorse but woefully inadequate for the 21st century in passenger comfort and technology - only cabin ceiling monitors for in flight entertainment. The new AA/US combination will need to work hard in the future to match their partner BA and the others competing with them offering US to Europe non stops.
3409,LHR-JFK on my way to Rio and I found that the crew were very unpleasant and had a couldn't care attitude. The connecting flight to Rio was cancelled due to technical issues and a hotel was organised but we had a terrible time getting to he hotel as there was no one to guide or direct us. Very unpleasant experience both ways and the food was a joke too - serving a pizza for breakfast! It was take it or leave it as they had no other options. The crew looked so fed up to be there. I am doing the same journey again but this time definitely it will be a different airline.
3410,"Stewardesses were extremely rude on every flight. I had 2 connections from Jacksonville FL to Long Beach CA and then 3 connecting flights on the return home. My carry on was well within the measurement requirements and every time it fit nicely under the seat in front of me. The bag carried my pillow so it appeared to be full. Upon boarding every flight I was harshly informed that ""it will not fit and would need to be checked."" One lady even tried to take it from me. I had to unnecessarily prove on every flight that it did indeed fit under the seat in front of me. After seeing for her own eyes one stewardess rolled her eyes and walked away. The beverage service was less than mediocre. Not one staff member appeared to be happy to be there."
3411,I took AA4244 from DCA to ORD on 3/17/2014. Flight arrived on time but there was no space for the flight to park due to the only one bridge being broken. After waiting 45 mins flight finally got a free bridge. Several people missed the connection. AA could arrange the flight to wait for few mins as they already knew the flight was waiting outside for the bridge but they prefer to give us hotel and meal voucher. This has happened several times on my trip. If I could I would not take such an airline again. Very disappointed.
3412,I would just like to echo the views of A Forrest (Mar 17th). My wife and I have returned from a long weekend in the big apple so endured MAN-JFK return flights over the last few days. The most antiquated substandard long haul flight that I have taken for a long time! I'm not saying that I will never fly AA again but if there is a choice then AA will not be my first!
3413,3 flights with 3 problems in less than a month. First bad weather cancels flight which can hardly be blamed on the airline. Not being able to even reach an agent to rebook for 48 hours and being forced to use an alternate airline to make meeting. Most definitely can. Second sat on tarmac for an hour waiting quite literally for a piece of paper certifying weight and then being forced to return to gate and refuel when minimum safe fuel line is broken was not fun. Having to literally run to connecting flight is even less fun. Especially when a comfortable wait was programmed into original flight. Third went to check in for overseas flight booked by government and after standing in line (no military bypass in system for check in) was unapologetically and without assistance punted to partner airline to stand in line for another hour. Because people who ticket with AA are just supposed to know this - particularly when standard check in procedures block military travel and leaves you stranded. Do the airlines really think making people wait needlessly and unapologetically is a good thing?
3414,"Manchester-JFK. Cannot believe there were no monitors in the back of the headrests instead monitors on the ceilings so far away you could barely see. The so called inflight entertainment (1 film for a 8.5 hour flight) broke after 10 minutes of starting and was off for an hour then anyway. When the ""food"" turned up I was given some cold pasta as there was no chicken left so it was this slop or nothing it was inedible so left it. On the way home there was a 2 hour delay and a gate change from 1 to 35. This time I got chicken but service was done in the dark and again only one film for a transatlantic flight so no distractions there or back which meant plenty of clock watching. This was my first time with American airlines and I can honestly say its the most prehistoric long haul flight I've ever had the misfortune to get on."
3415,I flew from IAH to ORD my next flight was at 9.30 but I couldn't get off the plane because we had no space for the aircraft I told the flight attendant to let them know that I was running late. She didn't care so ended up missing my flight. Poor service poor attitude poor everything!
3416,"AA51 on two occasions. 6th Jan and 9th March 2014. As a seasoned traveller countless delays and negative experiences I still go about it with a smile. The negative experiences that I have I often just take with a smile. Not so this time. American Airlines provoked me so much on my last flights with them. I travel often in both economy and business as a paying customer. This time I was in business class with ""The New"" American and their 777-300ER. The product is great so is the food and the IFE. But the crew of AA are a disgrace. From the moment I stepped on the airplane an aura of unwelcomeness was hanging in the air. The crew were stressed and did not have time for anything but to run. No smiles nothing mostly just grumpy faces. After a dinner service that took forever to get going and that was served with a slap in the face I went to their famous buffèt of snacks to have some water and some fruit. As I did that one of the two flight attendants sitting there asked me: ""Didn't you eat already?"" I stood there feeling unwelcome. I don't pay a business class ticket to be met by such an attitude. It is simply incredible how unwelcome AA crews can make you feel on their long-haul flights. I'd much rather have bad food and IFE but a smiling friendly and service minded crew."
3417,I booked travel 2 months ago for my wedding. The day of the trip American Airlines cancelled the flight and put me and my fiancee on a flight 10hrs later (in different seats) when they had other flights available that would've got us there sooner. After they flew us to our connecting flight they delayed it another hour. I normally fly with Southwest I will never make the mistake of flying American Airlines again.
3418,Flew NRT-ORD in Business AA 154 on March 10. The seats and service (apart from inflight entertainment) remain not as good than the Japan Airlines flights on the same route but I saw a real effort to improve. I often find Chicago-based AA cabin attendants particularly surly for some reason but this trip I was blessed by having an outstandingly efficient and even pleasant Japanese cabin attendant who looked after the Japanese speakers as well as me very well. The connecting flight to BOS AA 2474 had at least as good cabin crew and the pilot even shook the hands with the passengers in First before the flight started.
3419,The newer American Airlines triple 7 with the 2-5-2 seating configuration is a very uncomfortable in economy class. On a recent flight from Buenos Aires to Dallas/Ft. Worth my legs were touching the seat in front of me and so were my wife's. I am about 6 feet and my wife is 5'8. The American 767 from Dallas/Ft. Worth to San Francisco had more leg room. I do not recommend long haul flights in the triple7 in the 2-5-2 configuration.
3420,I no longer fly American. I was Platinum for 12 years but I can no longer deal with their customer service their change fees and their attitudes. Flying on American is tough enough but if you have an American Eagle leg in your trip you are likely to face delays slow baggage service and attitudes that are even worse than that of other American employees. Eagle will also tend to push your price up I have chosen to speak with my wallet and to stop giving AA my money.
3421,Very bad flight experience. Though I was booked in Business Class the seats and taking care of food preference was horrible. My in seat entertainment system was not working. Also on top of it the control to call the attendant was not working. Even the reading light on the seat was not working for a major portion of the flight I could not read anything. I had in advance booked an Asian Vegetarian meal. I was informed that the meal had not been arranged. My seat was moving I was not sure that the seat was fully in upright position at the time of take off and landing.
3422,Flew on AA1617 last night from ORD-LAX on a new 737-800 sporting AAs latest interiors all leather seats in First and Coach. The new colors seating and IFE systems are pretty outstanding. My congratulations to AA for continuing to add new aircraft and upgrade their aircraft interiors. It makes for a much more enjoyable flight experience.
3423,"This is a comment about the ""new"" American Airlines (American/USAir). My wife daughter and 15 month grandson flew USAir Express from Washington National to Louisville yesterday for a special occasion. They took off more than 2 hours late because of a broken toilet on the commuter airline (USAir Express). Today they were scheduled to fly back on American Eagle from Lousville to Washington National on a 1.25pm flight. First flight was delayed until 3.30pm and now cancelled with no alternative until tomorrow. So now they are driving back. We will do everything in our power to avoid flying the ""new"" American."
3424,I fly about 5-12 times a year so it's not a lot but it's not a little either. I've done international and many within the USA. I have never flown with AA but I will from now on. I usually only fly us air but I'm on a flight from CLT to Dallas/Ft. Worth and it was the most comfortable short distance flight I have taken to date. Other competitors don't even come close. (I'm comparing only to those flights within the USA and mid-size) the seats were comfortable the staff nice and each seat has a TV in front of it. Well done for changing my mind!
3425,IAH to LGA via Chicago O'Hare on March 6th on a redemption ticket. Both flights were on-time. Easy checking and Priority AAccess helped me to get quickly through security and to board the aircraft early. Very smooth and organize boarding both flights arrived early. Great cabin crew comfortable seats and generous legroom. Definitely recommend flying AA.
3426,Can not believe they tout new planes yet can't have a consistent onboard experience. I fly 2 to 3 times a week on AA and I never know what my flight will entail. Poor options for entertainment. If you are lucky enough to have internet on a flight you may or may not have the ability to rent a movie or show which I am happy to do. Yet I get on the new airbus which honestly is just as bad as their ancient md-80's and I can either stare at the broken monitor I was given where the sound doesn't work or like the passenger next me the screen was completely broken and would not display correctly. I get on gogo and it won't allow me to rent anything yet surf on a slow and labored internet connection. How can you not bring a consistent options to those that fly you the most?
3427,Flew on 2/27/14 from LGA to MIA on a US airways code share flight. Aircraft was newish Boeing 737 800. Seats were comfortable with adjustable headrest with plenty of space between my knees and seat in front. They were comparable to United's economy plus seats. Service was friendly and professional. The aircraft had wifi which could be purchased and the bandwidth was more than adequate for getting email and work done. All safety announcements and instructions seem to be pre recorded in a voice with a a neutral calm tone. As is the case in most US domestic they only have beverage service but they give you the whole along with glass as oppose to UA where they only fill the ice filled plastic cup. Inflight entertainment consisted of overhead monitors with requirement to purchase headphones however wifi availability made up for this.
3428,JFK-MAD return. Both flights on time and fine. 757 used which meant tired outdated and unusable IFE from drop down screens in the aisle. Be warned if in window seat you will not be able to see the entire screen. MCE seating wonderful to provide extra leg room on these long flights. Exit row seat seemed thin ended up sitting on my pillow for most of the flight! Crew on both legs were good return trip they were smiling and engaging. Something not expected often! Food acceptable but let's be honest-nothing to travel for! Multiple drink runs welcomed.
3429,AA does not care about its customers or understand why getting customers to their destinations on time matters. AA Flight number 132 was cancelled after sitting on the plane for 40 minutes due to a mechanical issue with the aircraft. The AA flight crew knowingly boarded the entire flight of passengers even though they knew the black box/communication box to the flight deck tower was broken and required repair. Many passengers had a connecting flight out of Dallas Fort Worth airport the destination for AA Flight 132. After 30 minutes of waiting with no information the flight crew informed us that the plane had a mechanical issue and the repair was being made. 10 minutes later the flight crew announced that the repair could not be made and the plane would be decommissioned. Asked to de-plane and had to wait another 10 minutes. Finally landed in Dallas. I ran through the airport and we were able to make the second flight (not our originally scheduled flight) and we made it. Flight attendants on this flight (AA Flight number 2467) were not helpful. No crew member helped us move overhead bags to get our bags up or helped communicate to another passenger to move his jacket down or a small bag that should be under such passengers seat. We finally landed in Los Angeles. We lost the chance to get to Honolulu on Saturday February 8 as planned and paid for. After waiting in line we received our voucher for one night at the airport Holiday Inn in Los Angeles and a $39.00 voucher for dinner for 3 people and an $18 voucher for breakfast on Sunday Feb. 9 also for 3 people (in LAX!).
3430,"SNA-DFW on AA mainline in first class DFW-LFT on AA Eagle in coach. This would have been an on time departure however during a strong storm our B737-800 aircraft was struck by high winds just before push back. Maintenance was called and an inspection was made with no damage noted. The flight crew kept us fully informed and drinks were served in first class during the delay. We finally took off through very turbulent weather. The crew kept us fully informed of the weather conditions as the flight attendants had to remain seated for quite some time due to the turbulence. Once past Palm Springs the ride became very comfortable and dinner was served. The ""teriyaki beef with sugar snap beans and sticky rice"" was unremarkable although the salad and dessert (freshly baked and still warm chocolate chip cookies) were fine. The red wine from Washington state was fine as well. Cabin service was excellent. Due to strong tail winds we were only about 15 minutes late arriving in DFW and I made my connection to LFT via AA Eagle with no problems. Early arrival in LFT and my checked bag arrived on the belt quickly. All in all a terrific job by AA and AA Eagle."
3431,AA 1122 - horrible plane. Seats were extremely uncomfortable even though the seat next to me was not occupied. If you ever have a choice - never choose this flight from Bogota to Dallas. The in-your-face screen in my seat did not work! None of the crew cared about it.
3432,Flew from LHR to DFW to make a connection to Mexico. They use the new 777-ER on this Dallas route. It was my first time to fly this aircraft and it's really great. I think it now must be the best business class product on the transatlantic - much better than BA. The seat is really comfortable. Great if you are travelling alone and get a window seat and you have complete privacy. The FA looking after me was very friendly and attentive. The International Terminal D at DFW must be the best international transfer experience in the US better than most European airports. AA system of tagging your baggage straight through to the final destination outside the US (ITI) is excellent.
3433,This was our first and last time will be flying with AA first with the 2 hour delay that wasn't their fault but we did not get a phone call like other passengers there was no cabin crew when we boarded the plane nor did they do cabin check (both journeys). We asked about upgrading to business class we were told it was full yet there were some empty seats and 2 of the cabin crew were in them. My mother and I both paid £75 each for extra leg room yet the 2 sat next us (both journeys again) said they didn't. Boeing 757 UK to JFK several other passengers also complained about how unhelpful the cabin crew were. Will not recommend this service plus delayed 1 hour coming back.
3434,"Economy PAP-Ft Laud-Dallas-YVR. First leg ok - on time and crew fine. Got caught in Ft Laud customs grubby facility more than 2 hours to get to an officer (5 on duty) - but US Citizens breezed through their own line while the rest of us shuffled forward. I politely mentioned I was going to miss my connection (no sympathy) and was told ""be quiet and stay in line."" Got to baggage claim and another massive line to leave - AA agent tried to rescue me and was rudely treated by customs and I was put back in line (I said nothing). From there on a gong show with AA - later and later flights missed connections no one to help at the gates sent into a line for help and told ""we are closing - sorry"" leave security and come back in and see if an AA check-in is open. Got some polite help from one AA staff - ended up stuck overnight. Next leg to Vancouver in a brand new plane with TVs in the seat (I am used to that on Air Canada) - many passenger asked for - PA announced ""this is a new plane we don't know how to operate the TVs either - if you need help ask a young person they might know."" Cabin crew were surly and short with very polite passengers. Never ever AA again! Arrival customs in YVR in spacious and attractive area with passport scanners and pleasant officers."
3435,I am still not a big fan of AA but it looks like that they are now working harder to provide to their pax some kind of decent flight experience. Flew recently SJO-MIA-DEN/RT. On SJO-MIA still operating the old 757 but with a refurbished cabin at least. MIA-DEN newish 737-800. Nice aircraft. Ground handling efficient and friendly. They assigned me an exit row and main cabin exit seats for free without asking. All pilots talked to the pax providing a lot of flight info. The winner was the 757 Captain of the flight MIA-SJO. After appreciating his clients over the mike he also took the time to bid a farewell to every pax exiting the plane with a Thank You and a smile. Even though their inflight service still leaves a lot to wish it is a nice manner to show each passenger the value they deserve. Overall a good experience and I'll fly AA again.
3436,Chicago to Dubai Frequent Flyer on American via LH. Been a loyal customer since the 1980's. It's really a shame how this airline has degraded. The planes I fly are always really old virtually no entertainment system at all if it even works there's no leg room and seats are often old smelly and sometimes broken. On one flight the bathroom floor was cracked. Staff are always great but they have a really poor product to work with and their frustration shows. After all these years finally had enough will be checking out from American after next flight such a shame.
3437,DFW-SEA in new 737 which was refreshing compared to previous AA flights on old planes however the new seats are cramped and feel more uncomfortable than older aircraft. In seat VOD is a huge improvement however it appears that AA will be charging for this in future along with earphones and food. Another downside is that the screen does not adjust. Even with the seat in front not reclined the viewing angle for a person of average height is poor and soon results in a neck ache. There is the question of service or more particularly lack there-of and attitude. This flight was no exception and service was delivered abruptly and with only occasional customer respect. I asked for a cup of tea (complimentary) and was given a cup of hot water and a tea bag on the side. With AA it's a case of get on board (sometimes you're welcomed other times you're not) sit down pay for everything other than basics (and if you want water mid flight go get it but be sure to ask permission if you're not interrupting the staff talking to each other at the back) don't complain then get off (and you might get thanked for your custom from an FA who might be sat on one of the seats - although at least the Captain often thanks you). On the plus side this flight was very punctual and baggage delivered quickly but that speaks more to the efficiency of others.
3438,Flight Zurich to JFK. Very old 767 plane - 21 years - showing excessive wear and tear. Dirty torn carpets and seat covers. Such an old and poorly maintained plane does not feel safe. No entertainment system other than a shaky old style TV hung from the ceiling. No magazines or newspapers provided (other than the thin airline's magazine). Food quality was average - liquor costs extra. The only commendable thing was the friendly crew and the fact that the plane was at most half full. Apparently the word about these run down planes has spread and few people choose AA on a route which also has a direct flight from Swiss. AA terminal at JFK is catastrophic. Luggage takes almost an hour to arrive and when departing the wait time at security was exceeded 90 minutes.
3439,"MAN-JFK. Used Oneworld (BA) reward miles. I had the lowest expectations having flown AA many times in the past both business and pleasure although not for some years. Check-in and security were the usual Manchester Airport slick and fast why can't Heathrow learn from them? On boarding we were met by a smiling and effusive purser who was greeting every passenger. Don't know if my BA Gold Card had anything to do with it but we were seated just behind Business in extra leg room seats. Yes the plane was an antique and had no seat back entertainment which almost beggars believe but it was clean and all seats and trays appeared to work for AA an achievement! We departed on time and arrived on time. We were served the preposterously named ""International Flagship"" lunch which was actually not bad for economy. Apart from the excellent purser the cabin crew went through the motions but were not rude or bad tempered which is a major improvement. US immigration was fast and the staff actually smiled. AA cabin crew and US immigration staff smiling what is the world coming to? Overall we were pleasantly surprised and would use again for the benefit of flying direct."
3440,"LAX-LHR return in Biz. AA put their new 777-300ER on this route and I have to say that they are nearly on the top of the market with this product. Lounge at LAX - not so great I am EP the highest but have to admit the lounge is lacking lots of food options. There were nearly none except few sandwiches. Compared to BA First class in Terminal 3 which is not their best the AA just does not stack up. The aircraft itself is great. Biz has walk-up bar which if the flight attendants are not too lazy has constant food. And this is where it becomes tricky. Flight attendants on AA are hit and miss. I flew them 5 times in the past few months. The same route. Sometimes you get great serving people who really care and would do anything for you and then you get a lady like I did who when I walked up to the bar in the middle of the flight and asked for a glass of water - since there was none anywhere had to close her game on her iPad annoyingly lifted her eyes and proceeded to look. When she found the bottle she slammed it on the bar and said "" You will be able to pour it yourself - I hope"". Seat itself is great. I recommend row 5 window - it has an extra space to store your stuff. Plenty of room to stock things up. Food - really great for biz class they elevated their game with wines as well. I can't fault them for anything in terms of hard product. The choices of movies - great. I am comparing to my recent trip on BA which had about 1/3 of movies. That really surprised me. All in all AA is trying but it has to do it faster better and more efficiently."
3441,From reading the list of reviews I don't understand why anyone would fly with American Airlines I however am military and am forced to fly what is given to me. Today 21 Feb14 flying on orders from San Antonio to Fort Walton Beach I was forced to pay to have my baggage checked for the first time in 8 years. I fly often and usually have 1 to 2 bags that weigh from 60 to 100lbs and have never been asked to pay. AA seems to have different requirement on baggage weights from state to state. I had no problem with baggage fees leaving Fort Walton but was charged 125 dollars on my return flight departing San Antonio.
3442,March 2014 AA 39 London Heathrow to Miami. AA2438 Miami to San Jose. 16th April 2014 AA 353 San Jose to Miami. AA38 Miami to London Heathrow. Haven't even travelled with AA yet but already we are thoroughly disillusioned. Have travelled business class with many different airlines over the decades and never experienced such disregard. For personal reasons we need a window seat and aisle so the moment we book a flight we go online and book our seats. These are always without fail honoured. But American Airlines have already thrown us out of our pre-books seats 3 times relocating us in inappropriate seats and separated! Each time we have re-books seats but today find they have moved us again and suddenly all other seats are full! We phoned only to be told that they were not prepared to move other passengers despite them being single travellers even though they had moved us three times without reference to our wishes. We are no longer looking forward to our journey and will be avoiding AA in the future.
3443,Flight 2048 MIA to JFK Feb 15th in Coach extra. JFK was recovering from a snow-storm but that doesn't forgive the appalling service delivered by AA to passengers stuck for 8 hours on what should be a 3-hour flight. 1 hour late departure ATC orders no blame. 45 minutes holding pattern somewhere off the coast around DC a further delay. Running out of fuel so we have to land in Philadelphia. Quick refuel and push-back only to stop halfway through because the tow-bar has broken. Then return to the gate for one passenger to deplane no explanation but efficiently and quickly done. Land at JFK at 10.45 pm. No gate held on taxiway get assigned gate but access blocked by de-icing an outbound plane assigned another gate so taxi a couple of hundred yards then stop. Eventually move to gate but another 15-minute delay. Eventually get to the gate and disembark at 12.30 am. Wait for baggage is interminable and at first there is no information as to which carousel it's coming on. I get mine at about 1.50 am and that's marked Priority. In 8 hours on the plane there was one drinks service no additional refreshment except for a hand-out of an oat bar. Inadequate communication from the flight deck as to what was happening once we'd landed at JFK. Appalling behaviour and lack of customer care.
3444,Business Class from Dublin to JFK. Not a great service at all. When we got on the plane the pre-flight drinks were sitting on the table of one of the business class seats. Everything rushed. Hostesses do just the bare minimum required. Earphones faulty. Had them changed and the new ones didn't work. Turns out the socket for the earphones in my seat was broken. So no inflight entertainment for me for the whole flight unless I was prepared for visuals only. Then got a cup of coffee in a filthy cup. Admirals Lounge in JFK is a joke. Pretzels cheese carrots apples some juice and coffee. That's it. You have to pay for anything else at airport prices. Then they looked for $10.50 for a glass of wine. I thought the girl behind the bar was joking. She wasn't. She reluctantly told me that one wine was complimentary and she begrudgingly served it. How can they justify charging Business prices and provide such a sub-standard product? Will never fly with them again.
3445,We traveled Jan 15 - Feb. 14. Our plane was delayed for an hour in LA and another 45 minutes in Chicago. There were only a few snacks available on our flight the TV didn't work properly and when we got home to Flint MI our luggage wasn't there and there was no reason for this because we had to wait for an hour on the tarmac before taking off.
3446,Would not recommend flying American. Yesterday morning I called their customer service/flight status line and requested the status of my flight from Cleveland to Charlotte. The automated system told me it was on time and after I selected the option even texted me a copy of the status stating the same thing. I drove to the airport paid to park went to the counter to check my bag and the counter clerk who was quite rude and non-empathetic said your flight was cancelled yesterday. Meanwhile I receive a call from my wife who says she received a call at home stating my connecting flight out of Charlotte had been delayed but the counter clerk had already told me that flight was cancelled too. No call was ever made to tell me either flight had been canceled. I am sure they would like to blame this on the merger or maybe even the severe weather and quantity of flight cancellations but that is nonsense.
3447,"Flew 2/9/2014 from St. Martin to IAH changing in Miami. We were in the first part (""extra legroom"" section) of the Main Cabin. On the first leg AA was sold out of Meals for Purchase by Row 11. (Dozens of rows behind - no food upset travelers). During the 3 hour calm flight attendants came down the row once to offer a beverage. Zero customer service. Extremely unpleasant crew. During the Miami layover had to retrieve luggage due to Customs. Plane landed at 6.42pm. Got our luggage at 8.05pm! Others still waiting after us. Baggage Claim personnel gave zero customer service. On the second leg into IAH attendants told everyone that someone forgot to put any liquor/beer on the flight. And again attendants came down the aisle once during the 2.5hr flight to offer a beverage (juice water soda only). Zero customer service. AA has a long ways to go in the Customer Service department."
3448,2/9/14 LAX to Chicago. I am extremely disappointed with American Airlines customer service. Staff were unfriendly and rude during the boarding and ticketing process. During the check-in process I received a message that I had not chosen a seat and was asked to pay an additional $68 for an upgraded seat. From the mobile phone the check-in process could not be completed until this upgrade was purchased. At the airport during the self check-in it was clear a seat had been chosen and no upgrade was needed at that time. Why are the two systems not compatible with each other? During boarding they allowed all passengers to board who did not have roller bags. This then resulted in less space for these roller bags during the boarding process. Flight attendant's allowed customers to place small bags and coats in the overhead compartments. When it came time to board the roller bags there was not enough room for these bags. This could have been avoided had the staff asked these other customers to please remove smaller items and place under the seat. Instead they were then rude to those with roller bags who did not have enough space accusing them of delaying the flight further. This seems like a rather inefficient process and one that should be reviewed to provide better customer service to those flying on American.
3449,Traveled DFW-NRT over Christmas break in 2012. Old 777-200 but the cabin was maintained pretty well and clean. Boarded last because of a late connection whisked into an almost empty first class. Food service was quick and good the steak I ordered was surprisingly good. An old flight attendant turned out to be a very funny and nice man who did everything to make the flight better and knew when to leave me alone (sleeping). Personal TV screen was not of the highest quality but personal none the less and thus enjoyable. Lay flat seat worked just fine and the ability to swivel and work on a desk was a plus. Calm flight except for circling for 30 mins before landing at Narita.
3450,"ORD to IAH. Check in was a bit of a hassle since the American Airlines staff directed us to a machine kiosk that was malfunctioning. After that hurdle was crossed a slew of others slowly came our way. Our original flight to IAH Houston was scheduled for 3.15pm at 2.55pm (local time) and arriving at 5.55pm the gate attendant told us that the flight had been delayed for an unspecified amount of time. We soon learned that the gate had been changed no announcement by telecom only by looking at the airport television screens did we figure this out. The new departure time was 3:34pm but that didn't happen either so the staff delayed the flight again to 4.04pm. As 4.15pm approached everyone was finally seated on this haggard and small CR7 jet. As we were about to leave the gate the pilot said there needed to be some maintenance and that it would take ""5 minutes"" to complete. 5 minutes passed and then 10 and then 20. By this time it was 4.25pm and we had yet to leave the gate. At 4.45pm we began taxing onto the runway when another problem arose. There apparently was an electrical failure and maintenance needed to be done once again. Back to the gate we go and by now its 5.10pm. Maintenance fixed the problem and off we go! We finally take off at 5.45pm."
3451,Booked a flight for wife stepdaughter and grandson to visit me in San Francisco from Indianapolis. (IND to SFO). The first leg to Dallas was delayed. They spent 4 hours waiting in Indy to catch a flight to Chicago. Flight from Chicago to San Francisco was delayed. What normally takes me 6 hours with Delta has now taken them 15 hours. When I had long delays with Delta they rebooked on another carrier for direct flights. AA = Anguishing Anxiety.
3452,DFW-BOG on A319: Feb 7th. This aircraft should not fly internationally. Not on a 5-hour route anyway. First class is a complete joke with only 2 rows. The bulkhead is extraordinarily uncomfortable and the last and second row simply horrible as seat cannot recline because it is placed physically against the partition between first and coach cabins. Entertainment? Lots of options If the controls work (I was in two seats and none worked properly). All these in addition to an over two-hours delay (excused by the nasty weather in the USA the last couple of weeks). What did not have an excuse at all was the extremely dirty plane (bathroom was not even flushed when first passengers boarded). AA flights to Colombia have shown substandard service and equipment for the longest. I hope all the positive changes in AA's culture that have started being evident after the merger with USAirways also benefit USA-Colombia travelers. In the meantime my personal advice to AA's Bogota-bound travelers: do not pay Business or First. AA is generally a good value in the back of the plane but not worth pay premium cabin for a substandard product and service into Bogota. I recommend AA anywhere but Colombia-bound routes.
3453,BOS-DFW-MEX and return MEX-MIA-BOS. 1/21/14 - 2/1/14. AA Platinum Desk gracefully accommodated our request for a departure a day before scheduled because of impending snow storm on 1/22. All flights on time or ahead upgraded using 500 miles awards on two of the legs. Service in first was prompt and cheerful. Food was fine-just the right menu for the time of day. Boarding well organized. Equipment well-maintained. All in all a very pleasant experience.
3454,We took our first American flight in 15 years to see if they improved and boy were we wrong. We took a 45 minute MAD-PUJ via MIA and return. All flights on time check in fast and easy. Priority boarding. On board very old planes on all sectors very nice flight crew. Their Business Class still have the inclined lay flat seats can feel a little uncomfortable for a night flight. But for other positions is OK. Food better than usual and nice selection of wines and drinks. For the first time connections at MIA went smooth and fast.
3455,We took our first American flight in 15 years to see if they improved and boy were we wrong. We took a 45 minute flight from Beaumont TX to Dallas TX. We were coming back the next morning the same time. The time for our check- in came and passed as we did not get the normal check-in email. When we checked our status they had canceled our flight. They did not even notify us to this. Then as we were waiting on the phone for Customer service we drove all the way to the airport. They sent us to Dallas fully aware that we were not going to get back home. They placed us on another flight 5 hours later than the original flight. Then I looked online to see what was going on. They weather was around 32 degrees. 281 flights had been cancelled in Dallas. At the time I looked 211 of those 281 were American Airlines.
3456,Flew Las Vegas - JFK 28 Jan 2014. If it wasn't for our crew the flight would've been miserable all the crew smiled from boarding to landing I was expecting the opposite the Flight attendant looking after us in the front was excellent he was always in the cabin offering drinks and so on only complaint is the seats and IFE after coming off a Virgin America first class flight they are way beyond AA's seats. The food was below par way below par that I couldn't eat it where as I could eat almost anything.
3457,LAX-NRT Economy cabin B777-200. Have to say one of my worst experiences in a very long time. Were told before boarding the IFE was broken so expect no TV for the next 12 hrs. Boarded an old plane with dirty cabins. Blanket and candy wrappers in my/ my wife's seat pockets. To my right on the other side of the aisle there was a lady with an empty seat next to her. She wanted to fold up the armrest so she could sleep across but the armrest would not stay up which was later solved by flight attendants using masking tape. My reading light was broken. American Airlines truly lived up to what US airlines are famous for - grumpy flight attendants shouting at foreign passengers who merely wanted to find out more about the food they were being served. And while on food absolutely horrible and I am sure anyone on that flight would have described it as such. Same chicken and rice dish for both meals but called different names. Same sauce same meat but one with carrots and onions. Not asking for Michelin- starred gourmet meals but this was just miles apart from coach class catering at other airlines I have flown with for example Cathay or Japan Airlines. If they can do it why can't American. Flight attendants delivering service chewing gum. Signs they were getting a tad too relaxed about their work environment. I am a frequent traveller and do not often (in fact my first time) post reviews but I really think flight deserves American's attention.
3458,LAX to LHR AA 136 27th Jan. New AA Business Class. Lounge very relaxing and bar served a variety of drinks. Nibbles were ok and more substantial food was available for a fee. Once on board this is the new lie flat AA product and feels more like a first class seat than business. Flight staff were very attentive and the service on the 9 hour overnight flight was great. Amazing food great entertainment on a large screen and the seat is great for working and sleeping too. A decent pillow and fleece blanket are provided. THe walk up bar with snacks during the flight was great as were the massive toilets in which you can change into more comfy wear for sleeping pj's are not provided. Bose headphones made for cinema sound and the amenity kit was of a good quality too. Food servings being on an American carrier are generous. All in all an excellent product and this does give Emirates and Etihad a run for their money as one of the best in the sky - well worth a try.
3459,Originally meant to flu YUL-LGA/JFK-CDG on Dec 24th 2013 and CDG-JFK-YUL on Jan 5th 2014 but a lot of changes occurred! Our JFK-CDG was cancelled due to weather in Paris. Flight from YUL-LGA was finally cancelled at the gate they rescheduled us on Air Canada to BOS (CRJ50) then British Airways to LHR. AA agents were ok and all speck fluent French. On the BOS-LHR flight (B747-400) they put us in premium economy seating was good but meal disgusting. Arrived at LHR around 4.50am we had our CDG flight scheduled at 3pm but British Airways found places for us on an earlier flight (A320). Our return wasn't cancelled as we entered the plane a B757-200 wifi- equipped we and 10 other passengers were told to go back to the gate. Given vouchers 800USD each Hyatt hotel and complimentary meals. The next morning staff helped us find the best flight. CDG-MIA-YUL. The 10 hours long CDG-MIA flight was on an outdated B767-300 but was really clean. Food was better than BA but still not as AF or Egyptair. No individual TV of course but good seat. I was able to sleep. The rest of the trip MIA-YUL was on an B737-800. Normal flight free beverages and everything else we needed to pay for. Great staff. I would fly them again.
3460,AA47 LHR-ORD in Business - maybe 70% full on Saturday lunchtime. 777-200 with 2-3-2 business class. Attentive crew a mixture of experienced and new who showed a real pride in the service they offered. Good concise communication from the flight deck. Food OK wine reasonable (although does show cost cutting vs 4 years ago when I last flew this route). Cabin showing a little wear and tear but generally OK and serviceable. IFE showing its age but again perfectly OK for an 8 hour stretch. Half the price of BA (although BA were in gouging mode because the flight was booked within 2 weeks of departure). On time departure 10 minutes early arrival. A decent product when delivered by a crew who care as was the case this time.
3461,Have flown AA F GRU-MIA-GRU several times. It is true that AA has pyjamas in First and better linen but still: cabin is always a bit dirty food is pathetic for first class with $8 wines and cheap whisky. Service has improved a bit they try but far from being a real F experience. On arrival especially at GRU priority tags are just part of your luggage decor: I have lost count of how many times I had to wait much more than coach passengers for my bags. The TAM product is far better and as they join Oneworld soon goodbye AA.
3462,"JFK to Heathrow. The flight was needlessly delayed by 3hrs at first not because of any weather or anything but just because it was not ""ready"" yet and then after we were boarded it was again delayed by 2 hrs. After we landed in Heathrow people who missed flights were not given any sort of lodging etc. This is totally unexpected from an international airline which is considered first rate. I write this comment to let people know what they can expect if they plan on a long flight with AA."
3463,LHR-ORD AA 91 14th January - a good comfortable flight and the food was reasonable. Excellent flight attendants very friendly and helpful. DFW-LHR AA78 - Business - 20th January. Although the business cabin was full the seat was very comfortable and the service impeccable. Very friendly FA's. This was my 3rd multi sector trip from London with AA and every time I have found the whole experience to far exceed my expectations.
3464,Traveled from Barcelona to NY flight # 67 and paid $89 for what we believed were extra legroom seats. Seats were cramped boarded last no space in any nearby bins for hand luggage plane was ancient didn't even have individual air controls. AA states we booked 'preferred seats' which merely allowed us to choose our seats for $89!
3465,I have flown MIA-JFK on an old B767-300. Flight was full. Seat very old but comfortable and pitch was ok. Entertainment only through overhead screens. I was shocked that this aircraft had the new hatrack design only for premium cabins Economy cabin still had the 90's hatrack design which a) looks very old and b) does not have enough room for everyone. Only non-alcoholic drink service for this 2hr flight. Staff very unprofessional. There seems to be an inconsistency in their uniform. One female flight attendant was wearing - what seemed to be her personal apron that featured dozens of US flags next to each other. After landing in JFK we had to hold at a remote stand before our gate was available. As usual passengesr were standing up and retrieving their bags from the overhead bins despite the captain making an announcement to remain seated. No flight attendant took any action only a Captain in American Airlines uniform travelling as a passenger made assertive requests for everyone to remain seated to which everyone then complied. Also saw a male flight attendant making a call on his mobile phone during taxiing to the gate. Very unprofessional!
3466,Ghastly flight in First Class on AA from PVG to LAX. The flight attendants were very nice. The seat was horrible. Uncomfortable. Had really poor leather padding a very weird need to press a latch under the arm of the seat first in order to operate seat controls. When in the bed/sleep position the seat had a bulging ridge in the middle hinge that made it impossible to lie on. There was no privacy because the seats had no enclosures or partial walls just wide open so that all the lights noise smells of the cabin were omnipresent. Bad lighting tiny hard to move video screen dirty floor cheap broken plastic laminate console patched poorly with silicon putty etc. It was like a really bad business class. Actually I've flown several times in AA's sub marginal business class and as bad as they are the seat padding is actually superior to the first class seats. Guess anyone who tolerates this service has never flown Cathay Pacific. Their biz class is outstanding. Every seat with an aisle seats constructed to provide lots of privacy good lighting headphones mirror private cabinet lots of room really comfortable lie flat seat. I used 67.5 thousand miles for my lousy AA flight.
3467,American Airlines flight 940 on January 3 2014 in Economy from Santiago Chile to Miami. No personal TV like most foreign airlines no headphones available (only for sale) wine and beer for sale only only one choice of meal flight attendants who don't look presentable no free copy of the Wall Street Journal or local business newspaper no after dinner spirits no ear plugs and eye shades and the seat pocket in front had trash from the previous passenger. The aircraft must have been one of the oldest I've flown in years. I will continue avoiding AA as much as I can.
3468,Based on a 3 day trip from BWI-DFW-SFO-ORD-BWI in first class I was pleasantly surprised and see AA as a much improved airline. Even though the first flight was cancelled due to a mechanical problem getting myself re-routed was painless though check in staff in BWI were not particularly helpful and if I did not have an app that showed me all my options I may not have had such a good experience. Two of the planes were new 737's FA's were attentive and friendly but still professional (shocking in a US airline). They tried to remember passengers' names and one gets the sense that AA is studying the premier international airlines. Food was fine but not memorable. The AA hubs I passed through all had their own personality but there was a consistency. DFW was friendly SFO professional and ORD a little gruff. The Admirals Club in each airport was good with very helpful professional staff. There is not much food or entertainment but that's not important to me in a domestic airport lounge. Reading other reviews I am reminded of my past experiences with AA and I am hopeful that my experience was a harbinger.
3469,AA79 30th Dec. AA50 8th Jan. I flew AA to PHX from LHR via DFW. Had a 772 on the way out and a 77W on the way back the internal flights were on an MD80. On all flights the service was excellent and on AA50 was quite outstanding. I was expecting very average flights but was hugely impressed with all aspects from start to finish. I would avoid row 1 on the 77W because on light invasion from the galley.
3470,ORD-LHR on 12/01/14 (QR 5288 - Qatar Airways code share). Flown AA many times overall impression has never been wonderful - usually met expectations though. This flight however was a shocker. Clapped out 767. Old CRT screens from the 90's hanging from the ceilings. Each one in the cabin had a different colour tinge. Meals were ok nothing to rave or complain about. Hostesses were surly with a bad attitude. Passenger next to my wife asked for a cup of coffee and my wife very politely asked for a cup of tea as well. Hostess snapped that she couldn't remember two things at once. Very unimpressive crew about as friendly as rattlesnakes.
3471,Currently flying from Boston to Austin (via Dallas) on AA. Flights have been on time and aircraft condition is not bad. However we are flying with our 3 year old twins who are actually very good travelers and have found that AA is not family friendly at all. They do not offer any pre boarding for families with small children. We travel with carseats for the kids because we find that this keeps them calm and contained throughout the flight a benefit for all on board but this takes a few minutes for us to put into the seats when we get on the plane and is incredibly difficult to do with many other travelers simultaneously boarding. So when they oddly did not call families for pre boarding on this flight we went up to the front during one of the many other pre boarding categories (carrying our carseats and our tired kids walking) and asked if we could pre board. We were told that we could not that others had paid for this service and we would have to wait on the side. We waited as instructed and when we got on we found that most of the plane had somehow already boarded and it was extremely difficult to get set up. We got no offers of help from any staff members. This is the least family friendly airline we have ever flown hope we won't ever have to fly it again - we fly a lot even with the kids will try to avoid AA in the future. Also in flight entertainment was broken on our of our flights.
3472,"BCN-MIA on AA 113 26 December in economy. Plane - 767 - dirty scruffy and well used. No seat back screens and on the overhead screens the first film started before the crew handed out ear phones - they were too busy preparing their sleeping quarters. Food dismal and when I went to the galley to ask for some water I was told ""Wait 10 minutes and we will be round"". But the main issue was safety. No pre take off safety check and on landing 2 emergency exit rows I could see were full of luggage on the floor the occupants on one had ear phones in and their Ipads on window blinds were shut and all this less than 2 metres away from a steward. Disgraceful. The staff were the worst I have ever had and to top it all they took 3 days to deliver our luggage. Never again will I fly with American. If I could give a zero rating I would."
3473,"MIA-JFK on 7/1/2014 on AA 1510. As with my 2 previous reports dreadful staff who did no safety checks and again blinds down and some setbacks not up. A dismal old dirty plane - 757 - which must have been 20-30 years old. No info provided prior to landing 're connections and when I asked how to get from T8 to T7 was told ""ask in the terminal"". I was so pleased that our final leg was with BA. And to cap it all American lost my Wife's luggage again. Why BA and other airlines have codeshare arrangements with this dismal appalling airline is beyond me."
3474,SKB-MIA 27/12/2013 on AS 1009. Poor service with no safety checks on take off or landing. Luggage in emergency exit rows and blinds down. We landed 25 minutes early but then had to wait over 1 hour to hook on to the terminal. On dismantling (it was at night) all the lights went out. The crew did nothing no torches at all and to cap it all they were laughing. AA never again.
3475,"MAD-DFW Business: Every single aspect of the flight is mediocre and lagging well behind competition. Tatty 767-300ER with 90s interior (claustrophobic even in Business). Caution: if you assume that travelling Business means you can relax and board the last on this Madrid-Dallas route you are in for a huge shock. All overhead compartments designed last century are not capable of storing vertically standard 22"" hand carry and as a result they get filled quickly. Crew unhelpful preferring to watch the chaos instead of assisting. Entertainment is only provided by Samsung Galaxy distributed by the Crew but at least the headset is high end (BOSE). Food is the only consolation tasting above average. Did not check any luggage due to fear of losing it at DFW. And here is the final kicker: Admiral lounge at DFW gives you a coupon valid for one drink only the very first time I was treated like a homeless at a Business Lounge. Avoid at all costs."
3476,AA 57 LHR-MIA 31 Dec. Inflight service in First Class seemed friendly enough however the food and beverage suffered by comparison with British Airways. AA serves Dewar's Scotch $20/litre BA Johnnie Walker Blue Label $200/litre. But certainly AA seats while older were lie-flat and comfortable in comparable pods. Where AA fails wretchedly is on the ground in baggage claim and in passing through security in Miami where there is no 'Fast Track' access to ongoing flights. For two years in a row despite flying International First Class with baggage checked and tagged 'Priority' by the international departure airport I waited nearly an hour for the bags in Miami with no American personnel in the baggage claim area to assist and no out source baggage company access to American computers. The result is that a missed or delayed international arriving bag must be reported outside customs and security to AA's baggage service office which does not have access to bags inside customs!
3477,AA27 ICN to DFW. 20/12/2013. First off Incheon Airport is a gem and it is easy access via express train from Seoul Station. On arrival at the check in we found a line that was moving along nicely. We arrived at the counter as a family of 3. I had a separate ticket as I was travelling back on a different date from my family. There was a hiccup with my ticket as they could not find the leg from DFW to AUS and we were travelling together. It took the check in lady quite a while to find it but we stood patiently as she was trying very hard. She finally had to give in and get a supervisor to help. All the while the other agents kept the line moving along and no one was stuck. The check in staff were all very apologetic and the supervisor finally found my ticket. She noticed that I am a Platinum level traveler and said that she would try to upgrade us all to Business Class. She was successful at it and we were given the upgrade. This made a huge difference as we were on our way home for Christmas and were not looking forward to that long flight in economy. The flight was 100% booked solid and not an empty seat was available. The staff were attentive and gracious. They went out of their way to ensure that our 12 year old son was comfortable and had plenty to eat and drink. Have to say that this was a very good experience from AA. Only drawback is that the entertainment system needs an upgrade. Screens are small and not a huge selection for an 11 hour flight.
3478,EWR-MIA-SXM. On first leg late arriving aircraft meant a delayed departure and a dirty plane. Flight was saved by excellent FA. Second leg late again no pre departure beverage uninterested FA/crew and filthy bathroom. Food service is rushed and fair at best.
3479,Flew from McCarron (Vegas) to Chicago to Manchester (England). After delays Vegas to Chicago (because of snow) staff at Chicago did everything they possibly could to get us a flight to Manchester. Ended up flying on time due to their professionalism. Worked hard for all passengers. The cases were delivered next day at least we were on time and cases delivered to the house.
3480,FRA to DFW on 1/10/14. Wife and children (well behaved and quiet) coming back home. No special meal request. Cabin crew went past them on two occasions once during the beverage service and once during the meal service without stopping to ask if they wanted something to eat or drink. They were not even sleeping. Worse was when my wife called them back the flight attendants acted all surprised that my wife and children actually wanted to eat or drink anything! Yes on a 11 hour flight. Incredible.
3481,Trip from Hamilton Bermuda - JFK-IND on January 2 2014. Flight arrived at JFK at 10.40 am and supposed to take- off to IND at 3 pm. Without any announcement or explanation flight has been delayed until 8pm when snow storm started then airplane was de-iced after which it returned to the gate and pilots left. Passengers were given alternative flights the next day - we got 2 tickets on Delta and told there are no vouchers for the delay. We booked on our own a hotel in NYC and next day all flights were still grounded. AA kept us on the phone for hours until we called Delta who changed the ticket for us and we flew the next day home.
3482,Flew from Recife Brazil to Miami. This airline continues to live up to their reputation that they have earned for being terrible. The check-in experience was such a demonstration of incompetence and bad manners by the counter staff. Both the ground and cabin staff were not helpful and rude. They seriously need to undergo training in customer service. They were 11 passengers in Business class cabin and they'd already run out of Beef and seafood by the time they asked me for my choice of food. The food was very bad. The seat was old and the entertainment system did work for some passengers. The staff disappeared by the time they take away the food.
3483,I travel internationally very frequently on business and holiday. My recent flights with American Airlines between London and New York were the worst in years. Rude unhelpful ground staff a website that wouldn't process seat selections filthy planes and truly disgusting bathrooms. Of the seven different airlines I travelled with in the last 2 months American was the worst. The flight crew were also noisy and talked for hours during an overnight flight. I will not use them again.
3484,As part of a One World American Airlines codeshare with Malaysia Airlines my family and I traveled on AA from West Palm Beach (B737-800) Chicago (B767-300 winglet) London 2 Jan and was completely satisfied despite the delays due to weather in Chicago. 3.5 hours delay in West Palm Beach and another 2.5 hours delay in Chicago. Both flight were packed. The super friendly hospitality of their Cabin Crew made the journey pleasant. The breakfast prior to landing in London was made up of just one tiny croissant and a small cup of yoghurt. Their aircraft's are old and their IFE very ancient. Do not have a high expectation and you will be fine.
3485,ORD-YYZ-LGA-ORD Jan 3-6. Flight out to Toronto was fine. Delayed a bit in Chicago but landed on-time. Flight attendants friendly and love AA's new E-175 jets. Return was on the day the huge freeze hit the Midwest. Morning flight to ORD cancelled and put on 9.15am flight. That was delayed a few times then cancelled. Went back to the ticket counter where the agent put me on the next available flight Tuesday night (36 hours later). I asked to be routed through NYC but she said I had to deal with the ExPlt desk for that. After 2 hours on hold for the ExPlt desk (completely ridiculous but with the storm issues expected) I got a friendly agent who booked me on the 12.55pm to LGA then Tuesday flight to Chicago. YYZ-LGA flight an hour late with only 8 passengers aboard. Great flight attendants - lots of humor. Landed in LGA and went to AA desk to see if there was any flight leaving for ORD that night. Only one was scheduled (6 cancelled) and she got me a seat in coach - was very happy. At the boarding gate got my upgrade by an excellent gate agent who had a fun attitude in dealing with all the craziness at the gate. Good flight to ORD - had a nice squash gnocchi and salad. Cookies offered also. Landed 15 min ahead of schedule as there were no planes landing at ORD. It was a bad weather period but I think AA did a good job.
3486,Flew Business Class from Santiago Chile to Dallas/Ft Worth on a 777. I fly First and Business Class on airlines around the world and I don't have a problem at all with these Biz Class seats and amenities. Even though the seats are angled and not lie-flat I slept like a baby and found the different positions very comfortable. The IFE selection is minimal and not competitive with other airlines but it was decent for the 9.5 hr flight - besides meal time and sleeping took up a big chunk of the flight anyway. Dinner was good with the traditional AA sundae served at the end. This was an 11.10pm departure on an overnight flight so the meal time is odd but I was glad they offered full options. The crew were fine - your average run-of-the-mill crew who have been flying for 40+ years. They don't make any effort to make the Biz Class experience special. AA service levels are average at best and can't come close to what is offered with the international airlines. The Admirals Club in Santiago was crowded and food selection poor. Not recommended.
3487,"PAN-MIA-LHR. This flight was delayed and delayed with no information forthcoming. We were eventually informed that it was due to a late incoming flight. The delay was so long that we were eventually told that the flight had to be cancelled because the crew were out of time and they did not have a replacement crew available. We were then told that we would be taken to a hotel room for the night and rescheduled for the next day. The staff did not follow this up with any action and eventually we found out why. They had miraculously found a replacement crew so the flight was back on. Even then we were given the option of flying or staying in a hotel. By now the flight was 6 hours late. We were promised by AA staff that when we got to Miami our onward flights would be rebooked and that there would be buses to take us to a Miami hotel for the night with transfers back to the airport. The flight to Miami was appalling no hot food surly crew. I was given two bags of nuts as a ""comp."" When we finally arrived at Miami the ground staff were useless one particular individual putting on the best display of passive aggression towards customers that I have ever seen. We were left to fend for ourselves. I got a taxi to a motel and paid my own way. Luckily the hotel had a free airport shuttle the next day."
3488,I was at the priority check-in line for flight 169 LAS to NRT scheduled departure 9.15am. I arrived 2 hours early I thought the priority line should be fast however I waited for 1 hour and was still waiting. From early morning there was only one 1st class counter opened the 2nd one was opened at 8.15am. The line was very long slow and chaotic. One agent tried to organize it so that the passengers waiting would not obstruct the walkway she had to repeat the same message again and again to every passenger that joined the queue. What a waste of man power and inefficiency.
3489,CDG to JFK. Flight bought at the last minute at a very reasonable price. Of course you get what you pay for. The plane (B767) looks good from the outside (new painting). Inside it's so old that I can't even remember the last time I've been in such an outdated plane. The overhead compartments were so small that even my bag pack could not fit in. No need to talk about inflight entertainment as there's barely any. It's just a few central screens with two movies played. The funniest is that business class seats apparently don't have inflight entertainment either as before we landed the crew mentioned that they would be collecting portable devices in business class. The seat was of course quite worn out and not that comfortable. At least the food was not that bad. I expected much worse after boarding the plane. Maybe it's because it was made in CDG but the pasta I ordered were tasty (even though the portion could have been bigger). What struck me was how non existent the flight attendants were during the flight. They showed up to bring the main meal and the snack before arrival in JFK and that's about it. AA had reserved the last three seats of the plane for them. Two of the FA's spent the flight on those seats while the third one remained hidden behind the curtain in the galley. You didn't feel welcome to ask for refreshments during the flight. Anyway all in all American clearly offers a substandard product. The worst product I've seen I think is that of US Airways. I can't imagine what the merger of the two will produce.
3490,DCA-LAX-DCA. 737-800. Outbound: Flight on time. Pre-ordered steak dinner was quite good. Staff efficient and reasonably friendly. Drinks service OK for flight length with a mini pre-packed snack basket (sweets chips nuts etc.) served closer to landing. Seat and entertainment system simply awful for so-called First Class with no foot rest or individual video screens. Only a video via the ceiling mounted screens and cheap earplug type headsets given free. This seat is not comfortable for a 5.5 hour flight. I hope the new seats that are advertised work better when these planes are retrofitted in the future. Inbound: Had access to the AA LAX Flagship Lounge (inside Admiral's Club) due to my OneWorld Emerald (BA Gold) status. Almost empty in the early morning with a reasonable spread of food and drinks. Flight on time. Staff more friendly than the outbound flight. Pre-ordered omelette breakfast quite good. This aircraft had the new sky interior but the same awful seats and entertainment. Looking forward to trying out new AA domestic seat and video products in the near future. Bags delivered slower than expected at DCA.
3491,LHR - DLW - Reno. Major complaint is seat allocation. Booked flight for 6 including 2 children under 7 6 months ago. Online checks appeared to show a group of 6 seats allocated together. At check in for return flight we were told that no allocation had been made and that only 3 groups of 2 seats were available. I thought that seating for family groups were a prime consideration. How naive of me. Other airlines such as Virgin can manage this simple task! DFW to Reno leg used an old Mcdonnell Douglas 80. In each direction the family were placed right at the rear where the engine noise was fearsome throughout the trip. Incidentally why not load the rear first to avoid the constant queuing to get on board and luggage stowed when loaded from the front?
3492,"I was booked from JFK to GRU on AA 951 on Jan 3 2014. American Airlines cancelled the flight without explanation and provided no alternatives. I scrambled to find a replacement flight on my own and got a seat on AA 919 from JFK to GRU the next day Jan 4 2013. I checked in more than 3 hours prior to the flight and went to the gate where staff were simply milling about. No boarding announcements until one of the American Airlines staff said that ""The plane (which had arrived a day earlier) was at the hanger"" when it should have been at the gate. Time of departure was pushed back 30 minutes then another 30 minutes then another 30 minutes and so on until it was 3 hrs late! As a result we could not go anywhere but had to stick around in case the flight suddenly started to board. When it was time to board the famous rudeness of American Airlines staff reared its head. The gate staff started barking at passengers about boarding the aircraft efficiently. The head of the cabin crew made a similarly rude announcement that passengers should take their seats quickly. The only saving grace was I finally asked for an upgrade and got one. Still even in a higher cabin the service was poor by notoriously grumpy flight attendants. We landed several hours late in GRU and had to wait a long time for ground staff to bring the moving bridge to the plane! The only reason I stay with American Airlines is for the frequent flier miles."
3493,RDU-LHR return in Y. Outbound check-in and bag check handled smoothly no complaints. Boarding somewhat chaotic but this was mainly due to the layout of the gate area. Aircraft on this route are older 763s with no IFE but seats and toilets seemed in decent condition. Food decent enough and FAs - while not terribly friendly - were diligent about offering drinks. Entertainment was pretty miserable but what do you expect when you have no seatback system and have to rely on the overheads? Pretty laughable for an international leg. Return flight check- in at LHR was a breeze but boarding was infuriating! Pax with group 3/4 boarding passes rushing the gate during pre-boarding gate attendants barely speaking above a whisper when announcing boarding groups. Really ridiculous. FAs on return flight much friendlier. Main Cabin Extra proved worthwhile as the legroom was plentiful. All in all worth the competitive fare but not nearly at the standard of other nations' flag carriers.
3494,LHR-DFW-SJO return via JFK. I set out with middling expectations of AA in economy and was pleasantly surprised. New 777 is great seats a little narrow but what can you expect? Flights to and from SJO on old 757s but crew made both flights quite enjoyable. If only JKF immigration would work a little better. Everyone's experiences are always different but on this occasion AA looked after us nicely.
3495,Recently landed from DFW-LAX-SFO. On my initial flight from DFW to SFO most things in comparison were fine however the quality of first class compared to Virgin is excessively disappointing. There were a lot more passengers in the first class then ever the FA was running around endlessly and even forgot to give us a cookie or even a snack with our drink. On the return trip the service was much better but did not offer any pre-flight beverages. On the last leg they even failed to grab my coat and hang it up for us. Overall Virgin America still has true First Class seats the new AA first class are more like business class with amenities. The food is quote mediocre but better then before.
3496,AA hits a homerun with its new business class on the 777-300. They've entirely reinvented the AA business class experience with lie-flat seats in private pods. From JFK-LHR we experienced great food good service and restful sleep. It beats the business class of many quality European and Asian airlines - and is the best among US airlines. Nice to see AA investing in its product.
3497,Wanted to fly from ORD to CLE and decided to take AA for the first time after having had bad experiences with them a few years ago. Flight was canceled 1 min before departure without any information and now have been waiting for 7 hours to get my bag returned. The ground staff are rude and unhelpful if this is suppose to be the new American as they advertise it then I think they should over think their business model.
3498,I have read many negative reviews about American Airlines and was hesitant about booking my recent flight on them but due to the price of the ticket (flew first class) and the short notice of booking a flight over the holidays I chose them. Well I was very pleasantly surprised. All my flights (GNV-MIA-IAD) were on time. The flight attendants were friendly and very professional. The meals were good and the airplanes were modern and clean. I usually fly Delta but with such a pleasant experience on American I may reconsider who I book on future flights.
3499,As noted in previous posts the American Airlines of today is in the midst of a steady decline. The AA of the 70's and 80's is now just a distant memory. This week I had my 17 year old on a flight from from ORF to DFW then to SGF. Easy connection and my son knows DFW very well and can get around pretty easily. While tracking the flight it was diverted to Charlotte. Reason was weather in DFW. Delay after delay now became a mechanical issue. So arrive DFW 2 hrs late. Needless to say he missed the connection and with Christmas there are no other seats the rest of the day until 9am the following morning. If I had not acted quickly and did some pleading with AA I was able to get him to XNA 7 hours late. So all in all AA is just nothing but a band of misfits and poor maintained aircraft. My son made it to XNA where a relative picked him up and delivered to SGF 2 hours away. Picked up bag next morning in SGF.
3500,Cayman Islands to Las Vegas in December. Overall a good experience Flights on time and connection in Miami was quick. Service and food were both good. Individual entertainment at the seats will be a huge improvement over the clunky TV hanging from the cabin ceiling.
3501,AA1319 IND-LAX I'm an Executive Platinum with AA and they do treat me well. Flew out of IND on 12/26 on their fairly new non-stop to LAX in a Sky 737-800. Flight was packed. I was travelling with a small dog a Christmas gift for my in-laws. The crew was great and the FC Senior FA was especially pleasant. AA's FC seating is very comfortable for Domestic flights and the seat recline version is a favorite of mine. I had pre-selected my dinner choice on line it was provided hot and tasty. Was hoping for a sundae but freshly baked cookies were served. If they can transfer their outstanding level of customer to US Air they are going to have a mighty wonderful Domestic US carrier.
3502,ORD-LAS Return. My wife and I recently made this trip with some friends. The flight out to LAS was on an old livery S80. I was in seat 30D which meant the engines were right next to me and it was some extremely noisy 4 hours. The MD80 economy seat is not the most comfortable. ORD was under considerable snow that day and the de- icing truck broke down in front of our aircraft which delayed us going out. It was an extremely turbulent flight but the flight deck kept us in the loop the whole time. Flight back to ORD was on an old livery B738. Pushback was a few minutes ahead of schedule and overall a smooth flight until we got to ORD which was under snow again. This time we had a decent enough movie to watch and once again the flight deck was extremely interactive. Standard flight in terms of food and beverage. The FAs were smiling very welcoming warm and overall did a great job in taking care of the passengers.
3503,It is almost laughable that AA is a part of Oneworld when the service standards of AA are not even close to its alliance partners. I flew LAX-NRT yesterday - disinterested and poorly-dressed cabin crew small and uninspired meals and an entertainment system that could have been considered to be state of the art in 1990. Each time the fasten seat belt was on there were no safety announcements and passengers and crew wandering around the aircraft during turbulence. It was such a pleasure to board a Qantas aircraft for the remainder of my journey.
3504,"This airline continues to live up to their reputation that they have earned for being terrible. I arrived at my connecting flight 10 minutes early only to be greeting by the agent who says ""we gave your seat away because you were late"" then proceeds to close the door. I was 10 minutes before departure time! I am a Platinum customer! American knew I was coming. Being a customer much less one with status means nothing to American."
3505,Had reservations for San Francisco - Miami and later on Miami - New York La Guardia on my 3 weeks USA tour. The SFO-MIA flight started badly where all passengers were standing in a long line 5am in the morning with no open check in counters and self-check in unresponsive. Some passengers overheard AA staff state that the flight will be delayed however I saw that all was according to plan on all screens. Ground staff finally came and they denied any delays. Self check in either couldn't read the passport scans or simply loading into oblivion with an error message at the end. AA staff was more concerned only with payment for checked in baggage which for a non US passenger is considered unacceptable. Check in was chaotic to say the least and the First class counter looked even less organized. Only after everyone was checked in the flight jumped from 7am to 8am and in an hour the flight was delayed to 5.30pm! No explanation or apology. Only 1 agent handled the full flight rerouting people with onwards destinations but no interest in assisting any of the passengers who have Miami as their final stop. No apologies no assistance no accommodation no food for a 10 hours delay! The afternoon flight was boarded on time on an ancient B757 that seemed to still have technical problems as we learned from the crew. We stayed on the tarmac for another 90 minutes. Plane old and showing its age with interior from the 80s and an inaudible flickering screen leg room acceptable. Crew incredibly chatty amongst each other. Non visible cabin presence. Flight from Miami to New York as well an ageing 737-800. As they again charge for checked in bags all bring oversized bags onboard causing a less than civilized situation where there is NO space for all the bags thus delays in checking those bags and taking them out of the cabin. Again no food onboard for a long flight. Will never consider this airline.
3506,Will never fly with this airline again just dreadful. Manchester to JFK and back just one film each way overhead TVs in the aisles not seatback. Poor food terrible tea coffee not much better staff looked worn out and as if they wished they could be anywhere apart from working on those planes. Delayed 2 hours on the way back. Two hours sitting on the plane is no fun. Obviously no contingency plan there then! Next time I'll just fly to Heathrow and fly with Virgin.
3507,I have flown SFO-MIA-Ecuador and back 6 times the past 2 years. Although the staff can seem a little long in the tooth and sometimes just mean I do appreciate the pilots. They seem to be a cut above the rest of the industry with those 757's.
3508,Having just flown American Airlines for the first time from JFK to London Heathrow I can honestly say AA are a contender for the worlds worst airline. From the state of the plane to the poor quality of the food to a laughable 1970's entertainment system all compounded by a disinterested flight crew. As a regular intercontinental traveller used to flying airlines such as Emirates Singapore Qatar etc I was truly shocked by how bad AA really are. What made it funny was reading the CEO's editorial in the inflight magazine his goal of being the worlds best carrier is a long way off.
3509,My trip from Toronto to Bogota has not happened yet as the connecting flight from Toronto to Dallas was delayed due to mechanical problems based on what we were told and they did not allow us to board the flight. The AA reps had us wait in front of different counters for more than 5 hours without resolving anything to more than 20 people. In addition they had to handle the receiving flights. The staff was rude and not friendly at all. I gave up and agreed to have my trip delayed by one day losing one entire day in my vacation plans. I hope today it will be different. I will never use this company for my business trips.
3510,LHR-LAX-LAS-LAX-OGG-LAX-LHR Nov 28 to Dec 9. I had a 2-week trip to 3 destinations in America all on American Airlines. All 6 flights were punctual and flight attendants on all flights were polite and friendly especially the last 3 flights. The new business class seat in AA's 777-300ER is the most comfortable I've had. Slept very well on both flights between LHR and LAX. I was also satisfied with the unexpected angled flat bed business class seat on LAX-OGG-LAX flights in 767-300. Overall I was very happy with their service and products. If AA ground staff can also deliver the same good services then AA will become a true premium full service airline in America.
3511,My family and I traveled on AA from CDG (767-300) DFW (MD80) Sat 14 Dec and was completely satisfied. AA excel in two areas: 1) The super friendly hospitality of their Cabin Crew and 2) They provide meals that will fill you - their pizza prior to landing is sumptuous and most memorable. Their aircrafts are old and their IFE very ancient. So if price is a factor (especially when traveling with family) they will deliver satisfaction. The game changer is when their fleet is replaced with the latest in IFE offerings!
3512,To start with my departing flight to Dallas was canceled due to bad weather. The AA rep couldn't have been less helpful. In addition when she re-routed me the new flights had no first class seats. Therefore I expected a refund to fly coach. They refused because I supposedly got a special rate which was still more than double of the coach rate and I was not eligible for a refund. On my flight home the first class section had no TV or movie and had nowhere to plug in my headphones to listen to music. My best advice is to fly United.
3513,JFK (New York) to LAX (Los Angeles). We got at the airport went straight through security which was extremely easy then sat at the gate for a while. No delays. We were in seating group 2 which was extremely convenient. We got 2 seats next to each other. They let us use all electronic devices. The only in-flight entertainment was 12 radio stations and a couple of magazines but it was a great steady flight. The food was fine. They provided a breakfast sandwich with ham and cheese on a croissant. The staff were friendly and it was one of the best flying experiences I've had.
3514,Recently flew with American to and from Key West FL. It seems overly obvious that this 'old' airline is staffed with employees who are looking forward to retiring. Late flights unusual delays on the tarmac fake smiles and just the feeling of being on a cattle car. The days of friendly flight attendants is but a fond memory.
3515,AA 922 from La Paz (LPB) via Santa Cruz (VVI) to Miami. This flight is constantly delayed or even cancelled. Most of the time due to technical problems which means that airline politics put cost control above performance and well above customer satisfaction. Always try to find a LAN flight before travelling with AA.
3516,Thursday evening they cancelled my son's flight to DFW (due to weather) I held on the phone for 1.5 hours and even though he was flying as an unaccompanied minor and they could see I was on another flight to a foreign country at the time they wanted me to pick him up and take him back to the airport later. My friends husband came to the airport to take my son so he could then take him to his new 2pm flight. I waited in line at the airport I was flying out from for a gate agent to fill out the paperwork pay the extra fee etc. but no one was even at work at the gate. I have to fill out paperwork for my son pay and still get to my own flight and through security. My son was put on a flight for that afternoon then makes it to Dallas. Today I come back to the country and when attempting to board my flight from MIA to DFW I am told I can't take my bag on that has already been on 4 American Flights since Friday. They called final boarding. She proceeded to tell me now I wouldn't be getting on that flight. The supervisor eventually put me on a standby flight for 6.50 am since I missed the 8.35 pm flight I was supposed to be on the night before. They told me I was welcome to sleep in the terminal. At this point I don't know if I'll get on the flight in the morning since I'm standby and they wouldn't assure me a seat.
3517,Flew ORD-MIA last week onboard AA1252. First remark: I got a reward ticket using my AAdvantage points and I must say that contrary to what happens with many other carriers a free ticket with AA is really a free ticket as I paid only 2USD for taxes and that's something I really appreciate. Flying AA is a very basic experience though: plane was a B767-300 freshly re-painted but about 20 years old even if the seat comfort is okay for a 3hour flight. No entertainment just scattered small screens and no meal provided for free just drinks. Having to pay USD 25 for checking your bag is something I really do not understand but it is a general policy of US carriers. Crew professional and quite friendly and a very talkative captain. Left and arrived on time with no mechanical problems happened as in the 50% of the AA flights I had flown in the past (total-10) so no complaints at all this time and I will consider to fly with them again for domestic flights in the future.
3518,"I am appalled by AA's ticket and baggage agents! Today my 76 year old Grandmother flew on an international flight from JFK to POS through MIA and from check-in to arrival was treated extremely poorly. This is a trip we have given her every year for the past 10+ years. But from check-in at JFK - the AA agents were rude and gave the impression as if we weren't worth the time. The trip began at 3am since her flight was scheduled to depart at 5.40am - I personally booked her round trip ticket and re-confirmed the requests for wheelchair service an aisle seat and extra legroom days in advance. None of these requests were listed on her reservation and when we asked the agent if she could try to accommodate in any way we were give very abrupt and snide no's. The wheelchair took 20 minutes to come. Baggage clerks - instead of checking her bags and placing them on the conveyor we were told that she had to carry them to the gate and place them on the conveyor herself as ""they aren't paid to do so"". Her transfer in MIA was exactly the same - no wheelchair assistance listed on the system and in order to make her connecting flight my Grandma had to walk a distance - from her arrival gate to the departure gate. Never again."
3519,Chicago - Toronto - Miami - Las Vegas - Chicago Every flight we took left on time. All flights were full except for the Vegas -Chicago flight which was mostly empty making for a great flight. The service was as expected and the planes were all in good condition some were in fact very new. The in flight magazine is particularly good on this airline. I was very concerned about selecting this airline as there are so many bad reviews about delays but honestly I can say we had a wonderful experience flying with them.
3520,ORD_DUS-FLR on AA/Air Berlin - 11/27 DUS-ORD on 12/8. Biz class full in both directions - I hope that continues as flying through DUS is a breeze compared to connecting at Heathrow. ORD-DUS 767-300 - the flight attendant was the only let-down: she was friendly but wasn't too attentive and talked with other passengers about how she didn't like flying long haul and was at her tolerance limit after a 7-hour flight. If you don't like long-haul then don't work it - ridiculous. Food was good - I pre-ordered it online and that worked well. Purser was very friendly. Arrived 45 min ahead of schedule and did the easy connection to Air Berlin Q-400 to Florence. Nice flight and on-time. DUS-ORD 767-300. Great flight attendant - friendly and attentive without being too in-your- face. Good food pre-ordered again online. Samsung Tablet is nice but again they don't put enough TV shows on it - you get one episode from the 1st season of a series. Overall I hope with the merger things keep getting better with FA attitudes. Good flights in general.
3521,Flew from Seattle on December 3rd. Arriving to Chicago we have found that our flight AA4250 to Hartford has been canceled. The AA representative has claimed that it is because of weather which was impossible to believe as practically all the flights to New England had been on time. We realized lately that they canceled it due to small amount of passengers. This is how American makes its money: they lure people with low price and convenient time and then cancel the flight when there is not enough passengers shifting the cost of the night stay transportation and the rest to the customers. Shameful practice. Ultimately unreliable.
3522,Traveled one-way moving back home from Miami to Rio. They use the same ancient Boeing 767-300 that I used to fly 20 years ago on this route. There is still no individual screens in economy. Dinner was acceptable and the flight attendant even offered a repeat entree-without my asking! Breakfast before landing was a small albeit a hot croissant with coffee and orange juice. Although we departed on-time the arrival in Rio was late by almost 30 minutes-with no explanation from the crew. All in all AA is not a bad airline: I just believe it has defined itself as a mediocre carrier. If it's cheap I'd fly it again.
3523,I would never have booked a flight with American Airlines had I known what a pain they are and how much they lack in customer service. I ended up taking the loss and canceling my flight to book with United Airlines. They don't have ridiculous change fees (200$ - more than my ticket cost) and they have people who actually care to help you and listen to what you say on the phone. American Airlines needs a serious makeover and judging from the hundreds of reviews previously posted saying similar things and not recommending the airline as well I am not the only one who thinks this.
3524,"Had to cancel my trip because of American's multiple delays. They called awakening me at 3am advising my flight was delayed until 12pm from its original time of 7.15 am. I arrived at the airport to self check in for my boarding pass because I couldn't print online due to the change. There was one person servicing people for ""self- check in"" in one line. So if people needed to check bags they were in the same line as those who did not need to check bags and only needed to get to the kiosk to obtain the boarding pass. An American employee should have been there to redirect people who needed only boarding passes and have separate lines. I stood in line for 30 minutes to get to the kiosk and obtain my boarding pass with no bags to check. Service attendant appeared incompetent to other customers ahead of me. The service was very slow with no pleasant smiling faces. Further I learned when I got to the gate that Flight 1202 again delayed another hour for 1 pm. Then I receive a voicemail that the flight again delayed until 5 pm and that I would arrive in Dallas 10.10 pm not to arrive in CT until Thursday at 12 noon. That was also not guaranteed. I needed to be in Hartford CT by 8 am. Hence why I scheduled the flight for early morning departure the day before. While I received a refund I didn't make my conference. They offered no alternatives to get me to CT in time on Wednesday. They only offered me an overnight stay at DFW airport red eye at 1.25 am with no sleep for arrival at my conference at 12 noon more than 4 hours late for the conference. Every time I deal with American there is always something. I will not fly American again."
3525,Flight that we were boarding in Denver arrived late we only had 53 minutes of layover time before our next flight in Phoenix. The flight attendants at the gates were informed we 4 along with 16 other passengers were going to miss our connecting flight due to the late arrival. 16 people. When we arrived in Phoenix to my surprise our connecting flight departed on-time we arrived 20 minutes late. 16 people late due to a late plane arrival/departure nothing any one of us passengers could have prevented. Naturally we proceeded to the customer service desk. I received a 100$ voucher for a flight costing more than 500$ no food or drink? 16 of us disgruntled passengers slept in the airport. I will never fly them again.
3526,I flew to New York City last Monday and I sat in the front row of coach. I got a lot of legroom and felt like I was in first class. The staff were nice on this 738. The plane was delayed 1 hour due to a winter storm. The entertainment did not work so I used my tablet. I got to have a nice breakfast with dessert and I got free baggage because of the Advantage card from AA.
14788,Good leg room in Premium economy. Don’t expect to stretch your legs all the way in bulkhead seats.
14789,"Seat 31E I did not find any 110 volt electricity .  It did have a USB port in the armrest.  One problem with this seat is that there is a support bracket under the seat in front of you that goes from the bottom  of the seat to the floor..  This piece of steel is 4"" wide and 14"" high.  It is located right where your right foot would rest under the seat in front of you.  There is only enough room for a backpack.  You cannot get a backpack and your feet under the seat in front."
14790,"Seat 31E I did not find any 110 volt electricity .  It did have a USB port in the armrest.

It is located right where your right foot would rest under the seat in front of you.  There is only enough room for a backpack.  You cannot get a backpack and your feet under the seat in front."
14791,"The biz class seats on A330 are definitely smaller and less private than on B777, but nevertheless they are comfortable for a 7-9hr flight. Also beware that the overhead lights above 1st row never go off (I was in the 3rd row and it was somewhat bothersome, but its worse for 2nd and especially 1st row on an overnight flight). Also on this flight the crew wasn't as hospitable as on the flagship biz routes."
14792,"I was in 7G premium economy. Not allowed to use the lavatory just two rows ahead of me--""reserved for business class"" per flight attendant. Galley very noisy from crew talking."
14793,Would avoid. Proximity to the lavatory in this instance is particularly annoying as (i) the odor does not make for a pleasant eating experience (or indeed flight experience full stop) & (ii) people will crowd your seat whilst waiting. The A332 overall is one of the better ships crossing the Atlantic but this seat is to be given a hard pass. Row 9 is where its at if you can get access to MCE.
14794,"great legroom, very comfortable seats"
14795,Light above seat does not get shut off during flight due to it being near the the galley - making cery dificuot to sleep
14796,"Flew from Madrid to PHL. This indeed not the flagship product, therefore less privacy, even in the window seat. However-
This is a great plane with a great bussiness class product. The seat is wide and comfortable, the IFE has a lot of content, the food was great and the crew were wonderful. I had a solid 4.5 hour sleep. The Sundae is a MUST!! I would happily fly this plane again!"
14797,"CLT-DUB

This seat was a nice twosome for myself and my older mother. Far enough back in the plane to where the wing was quite further forward, affording a great view of the cloudless skies much of the way to Ireland. Seats were nice and padded, but really didn't recline that much. IFE was of the old touch screen variety, and while the content was fantastic, the hardware was slow and erratic. Like, you touch a movie, 3 seconds later, the screen responds. As always with the A330s, lots of overhead room, relatively quiet, and really comfortable."
14798,"I reserved seat 4A when I bought my BC ticket 2 months before my flight based on reviews from this site.  The day before my flight when I checked in I found that American had changed my seat to 5C with no warning and no explanation.  My seat 4A was taken by someone else.  The foot rest section of 5C was broken, there are no partitions between center seats, and the people next to the windows kept them closed the entire time.  5C is a miserable seat."
14799,"Seat 25H is a Premium Economy seat with extra legroom. 
I purchased this seat for an overseas trip and was disappointed in the plane selection. There is no 110V power in this seat. The flight attendant told me there is no 110v power in any of the economy seats on this plane. The AA website does state there is power at every seat but the only power available is 5vdc USB power in the armrest. 
I was frustrated that both the AA website and SeatGuru were incorrect on this. Going to place a complaint with AA.com"
14800,I've flown this bird in biz but this was my first time in premium economy.  I was very pleased given that I was essentially paying a coach price.  I think row 6 is better than 7/8 because there is a footrest that fold out from under the seat and supports your legs rather than just something for your feet like a bus or train.  Rows 7 and 8 have plenty of legroom but 6 has quite a lot.  (I moved to an empty seat in row 8 just to see how it was different.)  The headphone/power port IS difficult to access but it is usable once you know where it is.  I'm an extremely cranky flier and I spent 5 1/2 hours in this seat very comfortably.  Overall it's as good as a domestic AA first class seat (not that that's saying a whole lot).  I seriously doubt I'll buy first class on this plane again; the price difference doesn't justify the seat difference.
14801,Good seat. The width of the leg rest is slightly reduced due to screen storage.
14802,"I was upgraded to this seat and feared it would be regrettable due to the proximity to the galley.  However, the forward galley really wasn't used so it was very quiet and low foot traffic up front.  I was on a domestic flight (PHL-SFO) so this may different when the plane is on a TATL route."
14803,I flew on this plane with the new premium economy seats in July 2018 and seats 8A and 8H do not have windows.
14804,"Sat in Premium Economy.  Seat was wider and had great leg room.  Only problem was the headphone port.  It was situated in the very back of the armrest, preventing me from being able to plug it in.  The flight attendant even mentioned the need to ""be a contortionist.""  I wanted to see a movie but unfortunately could not due to this issue.  But luckily I had a book with me so I just read.  I had submitted a comment regarding this to aa.com so I wonder if they fixed this problem.  So if you are in Premium Economy, bring a book or your own tablet for entertainment in case you cannot access the jack."
14805,"My flight from PHL to MAN on a 767-300 was pure torture, so this flight back to PHL from LON was luxurious by comparison. The seats are reasonably comfortable for a person 5'9"", and the recline was good. The crew was efficient if not especially friendly, and the service (meal, ice cream, water, snack) was good for economy.  One lavatory malfunctioned and was blocked off, but others sufficed. In all, a decent trans-Atlantic experience."
14806,This seat does not have an air vent. A minor issue for most people.
14807,"Although this seat row has a bulkhead / toilet behind the seats recline as much as all others in the same cabin. I flew HNL-PHX and it was most comfortable for an Economy seat in 2019. Slept most of the flight, without interuption,"
14808,"This was the best seat, best flight ever (except for the fabulous return), US to Italy and back. I wish this plane was used for long flights within the US, like to/from Hawaii (if you know it is, tell me!), although Hawaiian's 330-200 is very close."
14809,"This seat is marked as not having a window. This was not the case for me, flying this seat on this bird from FCO-CLT a week ago. It not only had a window, but a nice clean one with a great view. Perhaps someone is confusing this with the A330-200? 

Separately, I have to say that this seat was great. It's a standard economy seat, but offered at least 32 inches of seat pitch, which felt like a ton of room compared to my inbound flight to Italy on Alitalia, where I only had 31 inches of pitch. I'm 6'7'', so I have become pretty adept at sensing pitch without a tape measure. The seat itself was very comfy and well padded with a great adjustable headrest. IFE was very good, only thing is you have to really press the screen hard to get it to respond. FA's were super friendly and routinely circulated with water and drinks. Food was also exceptionally good and abundant in quantity, particularly for coach. We also had individual air vents overhead, which is great. 

So sad that AA is soon to remove the A330-300 from its fleet! This was one of the best flights across the pond in coach that I have ever had! It blew my experience flying Alitalia out of the water, and I'm usually biased against AA!"
14810,"Of the seats you don't have to pay to upgrade to, this is one of the best on the plane, in my opinion. At this point in the plane, there are only three seats in the middle row, which means there is more room between you and the fellow across the aisle. There are also three seats in front of you, so the entertainment monitor is directly in front of you, which is not the case in row 37. Overall, at least on the 330s, American Airlines' entertainment monitors are as crap as crap can be. You have to put all of your weight into pressing the touchscreen, which is very inconveniencing to the person in front of you. I've flown on American A330s four times now, and that has been consistently the case."
14811,"Obviously a more recent A330 aircraft.  Seats on the left have less legroom, while seats on the right have more legroom.  Both scenarios require additional fees. But since one mostly sleeps on the way to Europe, we did not mind being a bit more cramped.  On the way back we booked seats on the right because the flight lasts a lot longer."
14812,"Seat for DUB-PHL was in MCE and comfortable, but the space between the seat and the bulkhead was a little wide to lean on for sleeping.  The touchscreens are laggy, which was super-annoying as the person behind us was playing a video game and constantly jostling the seat.  We finally had to speak to him and he kept doing it.  AA needs to remove the games, period.  Most people who want games bring their own these days.

Cabin crew was attentive and kind.  Meals were typical skimpy coach meals (bleh) - basically a Lean Cuisine with a lot of starchy sides.  But they did a nice job coming through multiple times with beverages, which made it easier to stay hydrated."
14813,I am generally satisfied with AA business class seating on 777 and 787s. I fly them regularly (at least once a month). However this A330 aircraft which I believe is an older USAIR tail has the most awful business class seating. Extremely uncomfortable in almost all orientations.   My suggestion is to avoid any American A330 based aircraft.
14814,"As the corridor narrows around the toilet, sitting in 25F means that you will get your toes trodden on several times during the night flight home. 5 times if I am anything to judge by! 
This will also be true of the opposite side 25C"
14815,"There is no storage space, except for the over-head compartment.  And has a small tray and desk top area.  The foot rest does not have its' own separate control and only comes up when you are moving the seat to the recline position.  The space was not very private ( especially versus Business Class seat on American Airlines' 77W ), but maybe a bit larger than on the 77W."
14816,"Flew overnight HNL to PHX.  Seat was comfortable both sitting and fully flat.  I personally thought the pillow was oversized for the space you have at the head of the bed.  Good choice of movies but as previously reported, the in flight entertainment screen can be slow to respond.  The system on our flight had to be reset about 45 minute into the flight.  One downside to row 6-the lavatories are nearby, but the doors don't close automatically.  The light is relatively bright so when someone leaves the lav and does not close the door, it can be annoying.  It would be even worse for row 7.  I got up twice to close the door.  Would be nice if the FA's would notice or AA would fix the problem."
14817,"These seats were quite comfortable.  The entertainment system was slow, but it worked.  No Wifi on this plane.  It was supposedly installed but not hooked up (so said the cabin crew).  It was still a comfortable way to spend the 7 hours from Phoenix to Honolulu"
14818,"Seat was very comfortable with plenty of legroom for 6'2"" man.  The video monitors were unfortunately of poor quality with slow or no response to touch.  Movie selection was good and resolution was fine, once you finally got it to respond.     Very nice experience, overall. By comparison, I flew on a BA 747 on outbound leg and seats were miserable."
14819,"7H is the last pod in Business Class before the mid-plane galley. It is right up against the toilet bulkhead.  The good news is you don't have far to go to the toilet. The bad news is you may be disturbed by those using the toilet and by crew in the galley.  Otherwise, a comfortable seat."
14820,People are regularily stepping in to avoid other passengers coming down aisle so lot of activity beside you when you sit there
14821,"This plane was fairly new, probably only a year or so old.  This was a good seat.  In fact, if it hadn't been for the loud Greeks behind me who talked the ENTIRE 11 hour flight from Athens to Philly, this probably would have been one of the best flights I've ever taken.  I don't know how you can possibly talk for 11 hours straight at the top of your lungs, but the three of them sure did!  We got lots of decent snacks, plus pretty much all the wine you wanted.  I was impressed."
14822,comfortable and more legroom than I thought. Able to stretch out legs under seat in front and I am nearly 6 feet tall and weigh 15 stone.
14823,"Flight AA732 CLT-LHR was fantastic - we were seated in row 38, which provided us with plenty of leg room, an entertaining and lively crew and excellent food. The entertainment system worked fine with a good amount of movies available and the close to 8hrs on the brand-new looking A330 went by quickly and smoothly. Thank you so much for a great experience, we will be flying American Airlines more often! Please pass on our compliments to the staff who have made this such an enjoyable experience."
14824,"I picked 40H seat to be by the window and assuming that noone, unless faced with no other choice, would choose the seat 40G, so close to the toilet. This was a concern for me too but in the end it was a good choice: I had two seats for myself, no-one poking the back of my seat and enjoyed magnificent views.

It was a night flight and not completely full so I didn't notice a lot of people going to the toilet. I didn't really pay attention and that's great news, as in fact, I couldn't hear nor smell anything (my big worry!). I was happy with the seat choice.

What WAS annoying was the unresponsive touchscreen. I had to tap it so many times and trying so many different spots and angles, I was worried I'd accidentally poke the man in front of me in the head! That made feel good about noone seating behind me.

All the more frustrating as there was a wide selection of entertainment. Movies, recent as well as old. TV shows, games, audio cds. The flight CLT-LHR was over in no time.

AA flight attendants reminded me of teachers who'd been teaching the same stuff for over 20 years and just didn't care much any more, just going through the motions. What a shame as it really dampens the experience."
14825,"I have flown on this airplane several times between PHL and Munich over the past few months, all in economy. I have found this plane to be extremely uncomfortable and miserable. There are no main cabin extra seats on the plane, so everything is the same 31"" pitch seat that a tall person like me needs a can opener to fit in. The best seats are the bulkhead seats in row 25 and row 8, but you still can't stretch your legs out. My best strategy is to pick an open row and hope it stays open so I can stretch out sideways.

There is USB charging at each seat, but do not expect much from the IFE. The touch screen is completely unresponsive to make it impossible to enjoy any entertainment. Not only that, you will get frustrated with the person behind you repeatedly tapping the screen trying to get it to work.

Finally, I find it odd that they reserve 4 prime seats for crew use.  The exit row seats in row 25 (A,B,G,H) are marked off for crew use, and covered by a curtain during the flight. In a plane where there is a frustratingly low availability of prime seats for elite travelers, I wonder why they would take four of the best ones."
14826,"CLT-LHR.  Had limited choice so risked 25F, it was a mistake.  The toilets basically serve all of economy so are busy all the time, that wouldn't be so bad but the light inside is not guarded so act as a floodlight everytime the doors opens.

The rest of the plane was no better, it only had 5V USB, but at such a low ampage it could only charge a phone, an Ipad was actively draining when used.  The avod screen was also useless, with every selection taking 10-20 presses like some 15 year old resistive screen.  All screens had the problem, not just the armrest versions, with the whole plane thumping away on them. 

No idea how old this plane is, but the cigarette stub panels all over it give a clue, its time it met its maker."
14827,"Just flew Rome/Phila in August, in economy row 17.  Seats are leather, which is nice.  Leg room is very limited and cramped.  Movie selection is poor., touch monitors were almost impossible to use - not sensitive enough to the touch.  Was surprised about the entertainment being so poor, seems like AA has gone downhill since my last trip to Europe last year."
14828,"The legroom on this seat was really nice. However like any bulkhead seat I couldn't stretch my legs all the way out (I'm 5'10"") like you can under normal seats.  The seats were new/nice but the AVOD touchscreen barely responded, kind of terrible, that. But good movie selection. I would recommend this seat."
14829,My husband & I just flew in these seats to Rome on 5/11/2016. The ONLY thing they have good about them is extra leg room. AA should pay you to sit in these! Horrible seats! Almost all of economy uses these bathrooms. All of the forward economy passengers have to use these too. Most of the time there was a queue of 6-12 people hovering right in front of us to use the toilets which had become quite smelly after a couple of hours. The majority of the flight attendants could have cared less about any service & were just in a hurry to scurry off to take a nap or convene in back with each other. Will never fly this plane or flight again. We cannot believe we payed extra to fly in these seats.
14830,"My partner and I just flew on this aircraft from Rome to Charlotte.  This particular aircraft seemed to be ""newer"" and was in decent shape.  The IFE touchscreen was sluggish, and the movie selection was so-so.  There were a few current releases of interest.  Since the aircraft was only 50% full, there was plenty of room to spread out, and the flight attendants were very responsive.  Overall, I thought the flight was pleasant.  Seat 30G and 30H provide a nice view of the wing, though it is noisier in the rear section of the plane."
14831,"Great crew and very comfortable seat for Business Class. Older plane but everything in good working order. While I prefer the new Boeing 777-300 series , this is a comfortable  flight."
14832,"Ex-USAirways plane.  USAirways took delivery of these planes starting in 1996, and some of them look like they are almost twenty years old.  However, the sometimes threadbare appearance, balky IFE, and minor maintenance issues can be overlooked because they are very comfortable."
14833,"My flight had no AC power outlets. Not even DC power. No power was a huge disappointment since I wanted to to watch my own movies on my laptop. The crew said the USB ports weren't active, tho I didn't try. 

I wouldn't pick the bulkhead again. The seats are more uncomfortable with the tray table in the armrest."
14834,The main cabin extra seats only have the car lighter power outlet under the seat. Make sure to take with you a car lighter power outlet to charge the phone etc.
14835,"Half of the under-seat storage in front is taken by an entertainment box, so there is no room to stow even a normal small backpack. Plus one's legs are only stretched to half the space. The seat pitch is very close even for a small person (I am 5'6""), I think the seat would be impossible for anyone over 6'. No seatback entertainment, music the old-style 10 channels, movies + NBC overhead. Surprising these are still flying over 4 hours, e.g., across Atlantic."
14836,A newer plane. Did not care for the design. And there is literally no floor/underseat storage in business class. There’s a small pocket near the ground about 8” wide and maybe 4 “ deep. There’s an even smaller pocket next to the lie flat seat. And a magazine pocket. No video screen either.
14837,"Great legroom! 
However: The area next to the door (rows 20 and 21, seats A,B, H,J) is VERY COLD. Be sure to bring extra layers. One long sleeve sweater was not enough. The rest of the plane was warm, only we were freezing. 
(I flew this plane multiple times in row 21, I love this row.)"
14838,"The missing window was not a problem, because there is a second window further forward. The seat recline was limited but OK. That whole area (rows 12-13) has a separate feeling, which is nice, seems quieter, and is not cramped. It's a GOOD seat."
14839,"After reading the previous reviews on this plan, I was very leery of our flight between PHL and Budapest.  We were in the center section, row 34.  Fortunately, we had an empty seat between us.

The plane was a bit older, but the only way to tell was the lack of seatback entertainment and the old ""sky phone"" at each seat.  The seats were not ripped or worn, and the lavatories were clean and in good shape.  Otherwise, the flight was smooth, on-time and as comfortable as any 9-hour flight in economy class can be."
14840,Worst flight ever. Seat was broken and did not decline. No TV screen so told to use laptop but no power so on a 7 hour flight that was of no help. No individual air and cold air blew in my face for 7 hours and made me sick. Internet was NOT working. Overhead light was broken so I couldn't read either. Overhead luggage compartments are too small for most bags. Just torture. On return flight (259) ALL overhead lights were out. Stewardess told us that plane needed to go to a hangar to get electric fixed but AA refused to do so. Contacted AA and they told me they would give me a $25 voucher for my 7 hours of torture and that they thought that was very reasonable compensation. Do not book this flight from PHL to LIS.
14841,"I used to love the 767 for Atlantic flights . . . about 25 years ago. Today these geriatric airliners should be retired. I made the error of paying $80 for a window seat, and it turned out to have a broken reclining mechanism. So on this seven-hour overnight flight I was bolt upright with the seat in front of me right in my face. Worst flight ever, compounded by the noise (these are loud planes) and an indifferent crew. My return flight on an Airbus 330-300 was luxurious by comparison."
14842,Very old interior. Stuff works but cant recall the last time i was in business without my own screen! They are on the ceiling.
14843,Unbelievable cattle car ride.  These seats are so   narrow you can barely move your behind.  The pitch is so tight you can't sit a drink onto the tray table if the seat in front of you is pushed back.  This isn't air travel it is torture.  Never again on American.
14844,"We flew this plane for 8 hrs to Zurich and in this day and age, the flight was awful because you have no personal monitor to keep you entertained.  We had wifi and you could connect to AA's entertainment portal but how long will your batteries last?  The plane is 35 yrs old and although safety is not an issue here, we wish we would have done enough research to choose a different ticket."
14845,"Horrible plane, straight from the nineties: no TV screen, no power plug, mediocre food. Unworthy for today's standards."
14846,"As others have explained this is a decrepit plane, that should have been retired in the early 2000's. Plan on taking your own entertainment, power back up and food as you will get none oft his from the plane. I have to fly this route PHL to Manchester 3 times a year so I'm use to it, but its really an embarrassment. I would not pay an extra for premium economy or business as its a waste of money"
14847,"This seat and the one right next to it was terrible.  The ear phone jack did not work.  The seat would not stay in a reclining position.  I agree with the reviews for this plane.  It is old, uncomfortable, and needs to be retired.  The tv monitors were every five seats with no choice but to watch what was on and it really did not matter for the audio jacks did not work.  The plane bathrooms were not kept stocked and it was an overall very negative experience vs the flight outbound on a newer AA plane."
14848,"I was moved to this seat without my knowledge after an equipment switch. This costly ""Main Cabin Extra"" option is the worst seat I have ever had on a full-size aircraft. Misaligned window, limited recline, bathroom adjacent, and so crammed into the corner as to induce an attack of claustrophobia. Plus overheads that are barely bigger than a commuter jet: I couldn't even get my overnight case into them."
14849,"This airplane interior is extremely old and seen better days. There were no individual TV screens and I am not sure how that inflight entertainment works on your computer! 12A and that section is probably the better more ""private area"" of the plane and feels ever sooo slightly like premium economy. Although row 13 C/D/E is not great at all. 

Avoid 17 A / B / H / J its like you are sitting in the area where they make the coffee. Bad. 

I was considering buying a first class ticket for this flight as I had heard it was the ""flag ship"" business class but very very happy I did not."
14850,"BEWARE - AA are running this relic on the MAN-PHL route ""until at least Jan 2020"". I was able to get MCE as part of my status but there was NO power adapter and the overhead films were rubbish. seat was OK as a bit more legroom but when we took off it sounded like bits were ready to fall off. Only 5 more trips this year on this route to get through....can't wait!"
14851,"Flight in coach from Philadelphia to Zurich.  ""Knee room"" was average but leg room was not.  There is normally less room to put your feet in an aisle seat compared to a middle row but this was ridiculous.  There was a metal box under the seat in front of me and I believe along the entire H-row.  This left about a 15 inch wide space for my feet.  It was very difficult to get comfortable.  On top of there, there is no IFE on this aircraft unless you are in business class.  On one of the two times I got up to stretch my legs and walk around a bit on this 8-hour flight, one of the flight attendants told me I could not stand anywhere to stretch for even a few minutes and I needed to return to my seat.  By the time we landed in Zurich, I was so relieved to get off this jet!  My back and legs were cramping up from not being able to move.  Food service was average for an international flight.  I will do everything in my power to avoid flying an AA 767 again.  Just crushingly uncomfortable for a guy that is 6'3"" and 170 pounds. I will probably just take a competitor's nice 787 to Europe next time."
14852,I really think this plane was part of the TWA flight before the merger. Oldest plane I have seen in years. The biz seats look newer at least.
14853,Terrible aircraft.  Freezing cold entire flight next to exit row door.  Pulled my jacket from overhead compartment and still freezing the entire 8+ hour trip.  Leg room was generous and comfortable in 21J.  Aircraft interior very worn.  This aircraft should be retired.
14854,"its also not enough leg room if you want to stretch your leg, since there is a wall right in front of you, its only more leg room if you keep your feet folded... also the Monitor is right above and the colors of the screen changing can bother. same with seat 20A"
14855,"Flying from AMS to PHI This aircraft may quite possibly be the worst aircraft in the AA fleet.  Why are they still flying this outdated aircraft.
Seat 13J was in a dark dingy corner with no AC/DC outlet or personal IFE system.  The overhead entertainment system was not working.  
I truly think that AA uses different flight attendant for specific routs and our crew seemed to be rude at best and very unatentive leaving me to believe this was a South American rout crew flyhing overseas."
14856,"Very narrow, uncomfortable seats"
14857,"Let's just say my flight PHX-PHL was way more comfortable and modern than my international 8-hour PHL-ZRH connection. Seat was cramped. I'm 5'8"" and my knees practically pushed against the magazine pouch. Tried to sleep with pillow pushed into the window and arrived ZRH with back/hip ache. Controls are basic, light and call and recline buttons, dial for audio channel (to listen to the 3 movies shown on the blurred ceiling screens mounted in the center). Between my neighbor and I only one overhead light worked and we couldn't figure out who controls it. WiFi TV as described in the in-flight magazine was not available for Android.
Very outdated 1990s experience, minus the legroom in those days."
14858,"You do have extra leg room but the cold air that comes from around the emergency exit door is absolutely unbearavle.
I had to change seats in the middle of the flight and seated in a regular seat without extra leg room as I just couldn't cope with the cold.
I do not recommend this seat and probably 21J is in the same situation."
14859,"Worst “business class” ever. Dilapidated seats and tight tray tables. Entertainment is one movie on overhead screens. No GoGo inflight entertainment. Forced to buy Panasonic WiFi, which has no entertainment and too slow to stream Netflix."
14860,Aisle seats (B) have large box (unclear what it's for) that blocks a large portion of the legroom under the seat in front.
14861,"We were in seats 13 H and J on a trip from ORD to MIA.  I do not agree that 13J is a bad seat. These were main cabin extra seats, with a little additional leg room. 13J does not line up with the window, so that's a relative disadvantage, but this row is quiet and close to the restroom but not noisy."
14862,"Seats 21 A, B, H and J are all ""bucket"" seats meaning they are very narrow. as your tray table is in the armrest. AA sells it at the most premium which should not be the case. Go for Row 12 instead, newer and wider seats at a cheaper price, quieter section of the plane also, though no extra legroom."
14863,My seats 20H and J did not have almost any legroom as AA have build an extra storage for crew-blankets behind 17 H&J. We had less legroom than normal seat and paid extra. Plase was also freezing cold due to air flow from the build-in extentions seams.
14864,"Continuing from my previous review-
The seat control console is right where your arm goes when you're seating and relaxing to watch a movie after dinner. I must have unintentionaly moved my seat at least 20 times due to that poor design. Also, the IFE is on a tablet. I didn't mind it that much, coz it ment I could use my headphones without the 2 pin adapter. Also, its full HD, so watching movies was great. The crew did collect them about 30 minutes before landing.
All-in-all, one of the best flight attendents I ever had, and the plane is just old and loud. Time to retire with honor."
14865,"Flew this plane from JFK to Madrid (6.5 hours). Seat was a bit narrow and short for a big guy like me. I'm 6'2 and about 330 lbs. Couldn't sleep coz it was narrow, but seating in a relaxed position to watch a movie was really comfortable. Dinner was awesome! I pre-ordered the Filet mignon and it was amazing. Sadly, breakfast was really bad. 
Headphones are bose noise-cancelling and really good. The crew were great. My aisle was served by one of the most kind, nice, sweet and atentetive FA I've ever met. What a wonderful experience that was.
In conclusion, I can't complain to much, however, I would try to avoid this plane in the future. Same crew on the A330 or 777 would be perfect!"
14866,"Virtually all the B, E and H economy seats have very large entertainment boxes under the seats filling nearly  40% of the underseat space.  It's uncomfortable finding a place for my legs there."
14867,Unbelievable that American operates planes on intercontinental routes that have no invidual media centre (a screen in the seat in front ot you) in economy! Cmon guys!
14868,"Wow, the back of the plane is out dated while up front looks newer. I thought overhead screens had be removed years ago but AA must like them. A nice bright screen that cant be turned off on an overnight flight."
14869,"The seats in First Class are 180 degree lay flat seats with a very big pitch.  There is a lot of room for spreading out, especially true of the window seats.  2D is positioned directly onto the aisle, unlike 2A or 2G or 2J which are set in from the aisle.  So, if you are in 2D during boarding everyone walking past feels like they are on top of you.  Otherwise, I liked the seat and the plane.  It felt spacious."
14870,"It's hard to believe that American operates this flight as anything but a joke.  An 8.5 hour flight with no in-seat screens:  had the fold-down from the ceiling kind in the cabin every fifth row or so showing whatever they felt like, which was essentially a very, very, very long commercial for NBC ... it was dreadful.  I could not sleep at all on this red-eye to Amsterdam from PHL Int'l, and because I was anticipating a normal transoceanic airplane, I did not have the means to keep myself entertained for 8.5 straight hours.  The person next to me snored and drooled, which is not American's fault, but certainly less palatable with nothing to watch and/ or listen to and no ability to recline and sleep through it all.  Awful, awful flight and seat."
14871,"The seat and the plane have to officially be the worst plane and flight I have ever been on. Uncomfortable seats, cramped, insufficient recline, no entertainment- i paid for $19 internet that never worked. It's so bad- you can tell the flight attendants can't be bothered with it either. The icing on the cake was the service and food. I'm not sure what's going on here, but thhis needs to stop."
14872,the seat is HORRIBLE! the seat in front has more room at the expense of leg room on row 30. cramped all the way. AVOID AT ALL COST
14873,"I think this may have been the best economy seat on the entire relic of a plane.  Even that could not make up for the ancient entertainment system (one screen at the front of the cabin) and limited bins space.  A/C was non existent with no personal controls, and they showed a movie that was as old as the plane itself.  Flight attendants were even lamenting about the awful conditions of the plane and wanted it retired.  Awful that AA would still have this in the fleet and worse they use it for 7 hour+ international flights."
14874,"ZRH - PHL time warp. Moved back at least fifteen years into the days of overhead video screens. Samsung tablets provided for IFE were just barely satisfactory. The seat does lie flat and is fairly comfortable, but it's pretty narrow and feels sort of like a coffin. BTW, the Philadelphia airport is awful if you have to connect to an AA domestic flight."
14875,This is one of the most enjoyable biz class seats I've been in.  Daytime flight MAD-JFK. Great to be right be the window (even number rows).  Much less awkward than AA 777 seating.  Between the table and the shelf there is a lot of room and I had a productive workday.  Avoid the fish - it doesn't reheat well.
14876,"This seat is extremely comfortable.  Goes completely flat.  And when it is flat it is very private.  There is a lot of personal space associated with this seat.  However, if you are sitting here during boarding, there is no privacy.  It can feel awkward with everyone going by checking out your accommodations.  I like the 767 because it feels very spacious."
14877,This row does NOT have a moveable armrest
14878,"This plane needs to be retired, simply put.  Could not believe they only had the entertainment via the early 90's era shared TV screens throughout the plane.  Very little storage space, no power, and plane smelled like urine.  I would look for alternatives and not fly this back unless you plan to sleep for the majority of the flight."
14879,"Awful, outdated equipment. Welcome to 90s-era overhead screens, group entertainment and no power in the economy section. Main Cabin Extra is a bizarre tiny gulag crammed between galleys and bathrooms. American should not be using this archaic aircraft for ling-haul routes."
14880,"The tray table IS in the armrest therefore is immobile and minimizes seat width.  This is not indicated on the map and shows the seat to be a very good seat, but this challenge is unfortunate for someone of size.  We experienced this on two different flights (N389AA and N349AN)"
14881,"we had a flight from philadephia to amsterdam, flight was horrible!!!
no space at all, worst company to fly with!
We know you cannot expect comfort at a plane, but at least some hygiëne and friendly staff!"
14882,"Flight went well (from BUD to PHL) and the service and food were fine. No real complaints, BUT AA does really need to retire this plane. First, there are very dated overhead TV monitors, an often not working tablet in the back of the seat in front of one's seat, the forward BC bathroom had the sink completely covered in duct tape (!?), the other bathroom had only the cold tap covered in duct tape (a pleasant change!), and the overhead light didn't work. My husband was seated in 4A and had the same problem with the overhead light. The seat cushions are a bit thin, so my hip bones felt it for the next couple of days and although I'm 5'10"", no problem with stretching out to sleep."
14883,"Recently flew PHL-ZUR round trip in same seat. Very comfortable seat, got a decent amount of rest (several hours). Food was good and ample. Crew was very attentive. No problems using tablet. Minor issues: seat width is not great, could not lie flat, needed to be at an angle or on side. Amount of storage space is minimal. Would I ride again- yes."
14884,"We upgraded to ""extra leg room"" for our return flight from Budapest to Philadelphia because our seats on our overnight flight from Miami to London in regular economy were terribly cramped. These seats were terrible. While the leg room was fine,  the overhead lights did not work, nor did the audio volume control nor the wifi nor the flight attendant call button. One of the restrooms was out of order from the beginning.  I had brought a book to read and an ipad to watch films but could not do either. Without proper sound, forget the diversion of  overhead movies (bad as they were, perhaps selected for teenageers.)  9 and 1/2  hours in the dark in the middle of the day were totally miserable.  Never again on AA."
14885,"Just flew PHL- BUD in business class 8D.  The seat was comfortable but leg space was tight for my 6'1'' frame while in the lie flat position.   Seat 8A was reserved for flight crew rest and even has privacy curtains they deploy once in flight.  The curtains partially hang in the aisle and cause the flight attendants and passengers to brush against you in 8D.  Overhead bin space is minimal in the center section of the aircraft, but just OK on the outer bins,  That's a manageable problem for the biz class with fewer passengers, but is a bigger problem for economy.  American was offering to check carry on bags for free at the gate due to the very limited bin space.  Our food was good for both dinner (filet) and breakfast (omelette).  Service was good, but the flight attendant picked up the entertainment tablet while I was still asleep.  I had planned to watch something for the last hour of the flight but it was too late.  I was happy to have non-stop service to BUD, but the 767's are clearly showing their age."
14886,The seat did not offer extra legroom (paying $159 extra)compared to other seats in the economy class as one cannot straighten the legs because of the separation wall with the business class. To my opinion therfore paying extra is a hoax.
14887,"American's 767's provided reasonable Economy seating for a PHL-BUD round trip. Legroom and lavatory space were adequate; the ""older"" style seats wide and well-cushioned; window seats good for sleeping; and 2-3-2 seating convenient for aisle access.  Unlike most reviews here, the lack of inflght entertainment at my seat was fine with me it made it easier to sleep without distraction."
14888,12A and B are great Main Cabin Extra (MCE) seats - they're bulkhead but separated by a wall to Business Class. There are only three rows in this small mini-MCE section which make you feel separated from the noise of the Economy section. Seats were comfortable enough but there were two main problems with this flight: (1) the power was not working (note that power is a cigarette lighter adapter fitted with a USB port) and (2) no streaming movies available to watch on your own device - you are limited to watching the poor selection of movies on the overhead TV screens
14889,"Power outlet was DC ONLY! Very outdated, and when I asked for an adapter I was greeted with Scorn, as though I was supposed to have a Cigarette DC Power adapter in my carry on! My flight was from JFK to MAD, international transatlantic, and drinks WERE NOT COMPLIMENTARY.  I am platinum with AA and this was BY FAR the worst equipment - domestic or international - I have flown. Prior to boarding, make sure your electronics are fully charged, and substantially lower your expectations. Very disappointed with ""American"" Airlines for continuing to book this aircraft."
14890,The seats were very comfortable in all settings and the staff was very good except for one guy who was having a bad day for some reason.  Food was OK about standard for AA and thawing list good.  The selection of movies was extensive and quite good.  My wife's video didn't work and she was compensated with miles.
14891,"I find the whiny reviews about business class to be totally unfounded. My experience on a recent flight to Montevideo was completely acceptable. Yes the aircraft is old, and yes the entertainment system consists of a tablet. So what? The movie selection was decent and headphones very good. I slept perfectly fine (I'm 6' 175#...maybe overly tall or overweight may have problems). Pick a seat with the table between you and the aisle for undisturbed sleep. My vegetarian-requested meal was actually rather tasty (surprisingly). Only minor complaint was movement of person behind, when turning around, could be felt. Am trying 8G on return, so hopefully will eliminate that problem. Service was satisfactory. Quit whining everyone...you sound like spoiled-rotten (US) Americans and it's annoying. Admittedly coach is total and utter misery, but business class gets a thumbs-up!"
14892,"Overall, this is not an airplane for this day and age. The plane is old, filthy, cramped and just generally not pleasant.
Just the fact that there are still Overhead monitors, instead of in-seat entertainment for a transatlantic flight is beyond comprehension. The Wright brothers had more comfort on their first flight.
This plane is a testament of why American Airlines is going our of business, and considered one of the worst airlines in the world."
14893,"If you plan on flying the 767, here are a few helpful hints:

1.  Be under 6', 170 pounds, of medium build, and a size 10 shoe or smaller.  Anything outside those parameters will make for a less than pleasant business class seat experience

2.  Don't use the armrest on the console as that has the seat controls on it.  Not sure who designed the placement of it on the 'refreshed/improved' business class but I hope they've been summarily let go from that field of employment.

3.  The entertainment system consisting of a tablet leaves A LOT to be desired.  Awkward positioning, questionable power cord system, and flimsy construction make  for rough viewing.  Any sort of turbulence will bring it down like a house of cards.

I really wouldn't suggest that plane, or class of service, to anyone. Far from a business class experience, let alone for international travel.  Disappointing."
14894,"I registered on seat guru just to comment on this plane. this plane is so old that the arm rests still have cigarette trays. The extra leg room seats do NOT have AC power, It is DC power. And good luck asking for an adapter. Ive flown on countless flights and airlines across tne world in the last 2 weeks and i am embarassed by the service and experinece of flying American-based companies."
14895,"Very limited legroom in this ""MCE"" seat.  Nothing more than standard econ.  On my flight however there were only 7 people in the mini-cabin so was able to make a bed out of this row.

Beware seats in row 12 and 20.  Those arm rests don't adjust so you can't make a bed from those rows.

21B has lots of leg room but arm rest is also not adjustable, so cannot take advantage of an empty 21A.

In all, this is a terrible aircraft.  Basically no amenities to speak of.  IFE non existent.  DC (!!!!) power ports only in econ."
14896,"Flew overnight GIG-JFK on this ancient plane. Great legroom, but totally negated by the freezing temperatures around emergency exit (probably 15 degrees centigrate colder than rest of cabin). It was so bad I switched seats on the return flight."
14897,"Not a terrible hard product. Even seats along the windows have a buffer with the aisle and the bed was decent. There is no personal air and a lack of storage. Bathrooms are bigger than 787 but still small.  Food was ok, service was decent but it's a small business class. The obviously annoying feature is the lack of built in entertainment. The tablet worked great, but you get it 45 mins into a flight and give it up before landing."
14898,"Incredibly old plane, everything was dated and toilets particularly were unacceptably maintained. No in-seat entertainment (tablet handed out had a relatively good selection, but was not very responsive to touch). Although the seat was narrow, the bed was comfortable and it was possible to sleep. Food was good on this flight and the cabin crew were superb, probably because they knew they had to be to make up for the piece of junk that was the plane!"
14899,"Recently experienced the absolute worst flight equipment ever (domestic or international) during an American Airlines JFK -> CDG leg. Just walking onto the aircraft was a step-back in time. The business class ""entertainment system"" is an early generation Samsung tablet stuck with Velcro to the seat back in front of you . . . And then the old tablet was retrieved by flight attendants prior to landing. Nevermind that most folks never got them working properly anyway (Do they REALLY think someone will abscond with the antique electronics?) Many of the power seats and/or power outlets were not in working order. I suffered a shoulder injury attempting to raise my inoperable seat to an upright position. Food service was as just bad - Whole, raw, cold, ""smoked"" carrots as an appetizer - Before the gray, gelatinous, ""hockey puck"" of a filet. A most horrible flight . . . I even felt sorry for the flight attendants because it was clear they had their own malfunctioning systems to deal with. NEVER another American Airlines international flight itinerary here."
14900,"Pros: 
-the cloth seats are comfortable
-the two-row cabin of MCE for rows 12 & 13 are quiet and private

Cons: 
-overhead IFE
-no wifi on my flight
-where there is power, it is only cigarette lighter adapter (MCE)

This is 2017. How is this plane still being used for international travel?"
14901,"Finally American has upgraded their 1st class service between HNL and DFW.  After years of having to endure a tilted seat that always made you feel as though you were slipping down, they have totally upgraded first class.  The seat in first class along the windows offer the most privacy, with seat 2, 4, 6 and 8 having the most privacy since you are sitting near the window with a wide table separating you from the aisle.  No more having those awful oversize carry on bags hitting you in the head.  The meal service is not as good as it was in the past, the salad is now served with the meal.  Menu cards are handed out on occasion.  The ice cream sundae remains great.  While the seat width is not great, if you are normal sized person you can easily turn over from your back to your front.  The outdated entertainment tablets require that they are plugged into an outlet.  While the choices are very good, the time it takes to hand these units out with the Bose noise canceling earphones is ridiculous.  Time to see the entertainment center incorporated into the seat in front of you.  Overall an excellent experience for a long flight."
14902,"These are old planes. No entertainment stsyems in coach, only overhead screens. My flight to MXP was ok, there was a small box under the seat in front but the return plane is different and has a very large box under the seat in front.
Confusing since as I said there is not power or entertainment."
14903,"First class on this place is great!  Seats are fully lie-flat. 2 different charging stations. The seats along the windows are staggered. They are single with a console table area.  2, 4, 6, 8 have the seats along the windows with the console on the aisle. Seats 3, 5, 7 have the seats on the aisle with the console next to the window.  I liked the even numbered seats better - more privacy.  Great 1st class for domestic travel!"
14904,Worst flight I have ever taken.  Seat is very unconfortable and will only recline an inch or so.
14905,"I recently flew this airplane on American Airlines from JFK to Zurich and back, both in business class, and I have no idea why the reviews here are so negative for the business class portion of the plane.  I found the flight to be extremely pleasant, the service to be very good, and the business class cabin to be pretty standard.  The seat could be bigger, but in my experience, it was pretty much like other business class seats.  I sort-of liked the idea of everyone having their own tablet for entertainment... it does not have a screen with the moving airplane on it, but there is an extensive selection of movies and books on the tablet.  The only negative is that the cabin attendants collect the tablets about an hour before landing. Both my flights were extremely pleasant (I was in seat 6A on the outbound flight)."
14906,This is the worse plane I have flown on in many years. I cannot believe it is the plane AA chose for there new DFW AMS flight. It is in the exact state it was in 25 years ago.  My headphine jack volume could not be adjusted below the lodesr setting.  My husbands jack did not work at all.  This is a 10 hour flight.  The crew were great but also so disappointed that they had to fly in this relic.
14907,"Not as bad as some reviewers would have it. My wife and I were comfortable and slept well on the Raleigh-London flight. The lavatory was not a problem at all, and the coat hook on the wall behind us was very handy."
14908,"Very little legroom, much less than a standard economy seat, where you can stretch your legs out under the seat in front of you. American advertises this seat as being ""Main Cabin Extra,"" but that is a lie. Because of the bulkhead, you cannot stretch out your legs. I chose this seat because of the ""Main Cabin Extra"" designation, which supposedly means extra legroom, as I get pain in my left knee if I cannot stretch out my legs. I do not appreciate being lied to. I was in pain for much of this flight."
14909,This is the worst business class seat I have had on a wide body jet. The cabin should be gutted and rebuilt. Seat is short and crowded as a flat bed. Controls are not very good and can easily be activated accidentally. Entertainment technology is from the last century! Handed tablet but tv screens are still hanging from the ceiling.
14910,"This seat and those around me have no power outlets contrary to other information. Also, my carry-on 4-wheeled legal sized bag, that has been on dozens of flights with no problem, does not fit in the undersized overheads."
14911,This plane is a shame. 8 hours with no entertainment and minimal seat pitch. I am not particularly tall but still could not fit in the seat. A plane to avoid.
14912,This seat has no storage beneath the seat in front of it. My husband is 6' tall and has size 11 feet and had nowhere to put his feet other than in the aisle or the space in front of 31A.
14913,Finally have wifi on the 767-300.  Panasonic wifi just like the 777 and 787.  Also version 2 of the 767 is now the most common version.  There are very few version 1 configurations left.
14914,"These Business class seats - currently called First when flying domestically - are nice. I just flew JFK-MIA and wanted to correct some info I believe was misstated elsewhere here. There is no Row 1. The section has 28 lie flat seats in seven rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. There's a good photo on this Seatguru page dated 9/16/14 that shows the biz cabin configuration I just flew. There are eight excellent ""A"" and ""J"" window seats in rows 2, 4, 6, 8. Those in rows 3, 5, 7 are ok but directly on the aisle. Row 7 is missing one of two windows others have. Two people traveling together will like the D and G pairs in the center. Alternately, a couple may like the G & J aisle seats in rows 3, 5, 7. Happy travels!"
14915,"I am 6'5"", about 220lbs and this is the worst business class seat.  Let's not even bother calling it first class.  On a 7 hour flight, and you do not have snacks for the pax?  Yeah, you aren't first class.

The bed is too short to use.  With my head all the way against the wall I had to have my knees bent to even get the seat flat. comfortable with a lot more options for how to adjust the seat.

Just avoid these old planes."
14916,"This plane looks quite old. No space for the legs and hardly any recline. No personal entertainment system in eco which is a real problem for a 7-hours flight and no power supply on the seat. The food was totally scary, especially at breakfast. I will make sure I never fly AA again, this company stayed in the 90s and there's competition."
14917,"In general these ""Business Class"" seats are subpar, with limited legroom when fully flat, and are very narrow.  Also your head is adjacent to the arm rests in this position and you may feel like you're in a small box. While the seat lacks width, the ridiculously large adjacent desk space takes up the remaining room immediately to your right... they should have made the seat wider!  Also no in seat entertainment... the old style portable tablets are passed out.  This class of service is in dire need of a redesign and upgrade!"
14918,"This is a crew rest area on long haul night flights, and will be surrounded by a heavy curtain, so be aware if you are seated in front (7A) or adjacent in row 8 of this activity. In general these ""First Class"" seats are subpar, with limited legroom when fully flat, and very narrow.  Also your head is adjacent to the arm rests in this position and you may feel like you're in a small box."
14919,"This is a crew rest area on long haul night flights, and will be surrounded by a heavy curtain, so be aware if you are seated in front (7A) or adjacent in row 8 of this activity.

Also no in seat entertainment... the old style portable tablets are passed out.  This class of service is in dire need of a redesign and upgrade!"
14920,"On the updated American Airlines 767-300 with 8 rows of business/first class, the odd-numbered A and J seats are actual window seats with aisle access. The even-numbered A and J seats are technically aisle seats, as the console is located between the window and the seat. This places the seat directly on the aisle. For overnight flights and during boarding, this can result in people bumping into you when walking down the aisle."
14921,Flew from JFX to MXP overnight trip so the added leg room was nice to have.  Only negatives: overhead bin space is very limited and small for a jumbo jet.  Second the plane we had was the old swing open style of lavatory door (versus the accordion style which is more common now) so every time the door closed it was loud against the seat.
14922,There is no floor storage in this seat. Version 2 of AA 767-300. The power requires an AC adapter (cigarette lighter type)
14923,"Seat 3A in the AA B767-Ver. 2 has the desk between the seat and the window, making access to looking out the window a little more difficult than in the"
14924,"I flew MIA-MVD a couple of nights ago on one of the 763s in this configuration (reg: N389AA) and I was pleasantly surprised. 1) The aircraft was 22 years old but the whole cabin and even toilet was immaculate. Must have been fresh from heavy maintenance - goes to show how this can cloak aircraft age. 2) The seat was more comfortable than anticipated. If not for snoring passenger one row behind, could have slept most of the flight. 3) As a bonus, AA service was quite decent and food just about edible. Very different to my AA 763 experiences in the past. A point for SeatGuru: row 13 is missing a window on both sides."
14925,This flight from DFW to Honolulu was very good. The flight attendants were superb!
14926,"All the seats in Biz have A/C power ports and all the seats in Main Cabin Extra are still DC/Car charger power ports, on long haul flights, they carry a few converters, so ask nicely and you might be able to get one."
14927,"In the 763 V2 Business Class, with 1-2-1 row format, the Even numbered D seats are hard on the aisle, with a smaller width table than the G seat (9 inch difference?).  The G seat has its table next to the aisle, giving you a touch more privacy.  The Even numbered A seats sit next to the window with table on the aisle, the Even numbered J seats are on the aisle with the table next to the window.  Odd numbered seats are reversed.  All still better than the old V1 2-2-2 format."
14928,"During the flight rows 20-22 were EXTREMELY COLD. Passengers doubled up on blankets, literally wore winter clothing with hats, hoods, and gloves AND the flight attendants passed out HOT WATER bottles to passengers. They said it is ALWAYS cold over the wings and exit rows (that we paid extra for)."
14929,"Finally, American has some fully flat seats in business.  A noticeable drawback, however, is the the cubby hole for your feet in the bed position leaves no room to move your feet around as you are attempting to sleep. Also, the food on this flight was below par, even for economy."
14930,"Once again, AA switched the plane on us in Dallas.  Reason---mechanical.  This is the third trip in a row in which this has happened.  Instead of 1-2-1 seating, it's a very old 2-2-2 First/Business class seating with angle lie flat beds.  Absolutely no way anyone is going to be able to exit his/her seat if it is a window.  There isn't one inch of space between the aisle seat and the unmoveable arm rest.  Service and food were good, but this is a joke of a plane for and 8 1/2 hour flight.  IFE system was good, and there was a nice selection of movies from which to choose"
14931,"First time flying American Airlines. Great experience from check in to landing. Check in staff very efficient no problems and minimal waiting. Boarding usual order passengers with children or who needed help , followowed by business class passengers etc. Very attentive flight attendants a couple if glasses of champagne. Entertainment business class passengers are given a samsung tablet and Bose headphones, a good selection of tv / movies. Not sure how passengers who do not used tablets would of got on.Seat good, plenty if leg room and adjustment of the seat, I did not try the lay flat option a minor niggle the seat control panel is very sensitive so sometimes you would accidently move the seat if you rested you elbow on the panel. Food great I was able to select sone if the food online. Would definetley fly American again"
14932,"The seat converted into a flat bed but this was the only plus point about this flight. The plane was grotty and very shabby - I felt dirty within minutes of sitting down.  There was no storage at the seat and no privacy screen between myself and the seat next to me. As others have said, the plane was old and had the look and feel of something from the 1970s. My recommendation: AVOID at all costs. It's not worth anything like the £4k that my seat cost. Not special or luxurious like other airlines. The amenity bag looked cheap and was comparable to what economy passengers get on other flights.  Even though I had boarded at 9.45pm there had been no option to eat before boarding so that we could sleep on the flight."
14933,Travelling from JFK to CDG this 767 was a bit of a downgrade as our flight to JFK some weeks earlier was in one of the refurbished 777-200's. I already knew these seats Finnair that uses similar seats in their A330's. Awkward table and Samsung tablets for entertainment. Nevertheless I had some excellent sleep on this short (6:30) flight.
14934,This is an old and inconvenient  airplane. No space in bins
14935,"You may think you are just going from Point A to Point B, but you get something extra as this plane (in Economy or MCE) is also a time machine. It allows you to travel as people did in the 80s, without the higher quality meals or service. Old bathrooms, no power, no video screens except the big clunky tvs hanging from the ceiling. Pretty cool, right? If you disagree, do not fly this bird unless your in business...even then, it should be really be the cheapest Biz ticket between your destinations."
14936,"I am frequent traveler and this plane was big surprise. If I know I will  never book this flight. It is very old plane, uncomfortable seats, no space for carry on bags at all,so small overhead bins. Worst part is entertainment, no TV unit in front seat, most boring and long flight ever had.
Staff on my side was very nice and helpful."
14937,"Oldest plane in the fleet!! 
No legroom, air, or video screens.
This plane should not be used for overseas flights for 9 hours, which it currently is. They hand out newspapers because they know you will need it in hour 4 of 9."
14938,"I was at the bulkhead seat in 12A, so this was certainly a 767-300 v2 layout, but the power was DC, not AC as noted on the page."
14939,"My family flew from New York to Zurich and back! My dad was a staff for American so he booked a staff ticket for just $0 and me and my mother was part of his buddy pass! First thing I wanted to address about this standby ticket was that we always have to dress up in business clothes! I'm tired of sticking to business clothes! My dad tried to book a business class ticket for the 3 of us. Flight 64 did not have any available BC seats from NY to Zurich so we sat on Economy. Not what I was expecting, no Personal IFE, bit crampy seat, and stuff! My seat was 32J so the only thing I was glad about is the food service and the window seat! I have to face 7 hours or boredom and being cramped overnight! I had trouble sleeping. We also had a return back to NY with BC seats! It was good, the only thing I hate about is not being seated on the window section, but we were in the front! My seat is 2H. It was an amazing experience thanks to the personal Samsung Galaxy Tab provided by the airline. My dad always go for American first when we book trips to Europe or any other country that American flies to. But I will not choose American if I do not fly with a personal IFE! If I had the chance to make a suggestion about the 763 on American, I tell em to put a personal IFE and a power outlet on every seat (including the Economy Cabin), or don't use the 763 on any flights over 3 hours! That's all I have to say! BTW, I think I do know that Delta can be a good alternative from ZRH to JFK, even though it uses the 763! The aircraft 763 is cool though, but google flights showed me that Delta could have Wi-Fi on there, and one thing I like is that it had power outlets and a personal IFE! If you get a 763 on an American to locations over 3 hours, choose Delta, the second cheapest airline!"
14940,"This plane, except for the revamped Business Class, is a real old bucket of bolts. Avoid this seat. This seat is less than 3 feet from the Lavatory door, which opens facing forward so you get the ""waft of lovely lavatory air"" every time the door is opened, which is pretty much all night. The flushing sound is so loud you cannot possibly sleep through it. When the seat in front is fully reclined (as this is a Business Extra seat with supposed extra leg room) you cannot have a laptop opened on the tray table, making it impossible to watch any entertainment on your own device, which is necessary, since the affor mentioned ""old bucket of bolts"" does not offer ANY VOD at the seat for an 8+hour flight from ORD to CDG. Pretty rediculous on AA's part."
14941,"AA should retired all OLD B767-300 like the aircraft I flew. As American, I felt embarrassed when I aboard this aircraft because I heard most foreigners said ""Oh my gosh"" about the aircraft. Especially flew from/to Zurich, home one of the richest people in the world."
14942,Flew JFK to MAN in seat 12J. seat is extra narrow as the tray table is in the arm rest. I'm 6 foot 3. bulkhead allows for room but you can't stretch your legs out as they hit the bulkhead. Only good seats on this plane are 21B and 21H. About 2 feet of leg room. 21A and 21J have great room but the side wall restricts you shoulder
14943,"Flew this plane from MAN to JFK. For a business class seat it is really a poor design. At 20 inches it is narrow for business class. Although your lower body is comfortable your shoulders are wider than the seat will allow. Seat controls are located where your elbow rests so the seat is constantly self adjusting. Window even number seats are better than odd number seats as they are next to the side wall. Odd seats are next to the isle where the cart bumps you and wakes you up. Entertainment is a tablet with nothing much to watch. Really annoying design. Other than food and drink, business class on this aircraft is not worth the price. On a positive 2J has 3 windows."
14944,"Window looks over wing motor, blocking view. Prefer 2j or 6J because seat is closer to window, and not on isle"
14945,"HORRIBLE. No Personal IFE, old plane, tiny aisle. flight attendants were rude. not helpful at all. Never again."
14946,"Watch out for AL'S current seat games on HNL flights. Booked my flight and seat 4A 8 months in advance, and then three weeks before flight, I receive an e-mail stating there had been a flight change. No notice that the seat configuration was changing from 2-2-2 to 1-2-1, and our two window/  aisle seats were changed to a center and window seat, so we were seated across an aisle.  They could only then give us bulkhead seats.  On the day of flight 5/21/16, we boarded only to find the aircraft was the old configuration. Instead of returning our original window/aisle seats, they kept us in the center bulkhead seats. Our friendly FA stated seating was not her department.  Same issue on our return flight on 6/10, so apparently AA'S planning and website cannot be trusted. The couple behind us had a similar experience, and the only consistency was the FA'S response that seating was not her problem.  Apparently Useless Air's service level has transferred over to the AA livery."
14947,"As stated before, even numbered aisles are the best for window seating.  Flew this equipment from PHL to ZRH on 20 May - I have to say it was the best service I've had on AA - I was lucky enough to have the lead flight attendant (Stefan, I believe) serving my side of the cabin.  Fantastic.  Seats are fine - I didn't find the touch screen for the seat controls a big deal.  However, the in flight entertainment is an atrocity.  It takes the crew 30 minutes to hand out the tablets, and then they collect them an hour before landing (or sneak them away while you are sleeping, which is what they did to me).  I will admit I don't watch too much on an overnight flight, but it's nice to watch a TV show or something.  My plea to AA would be to bring these planes into the 21st century  with some decent IFE kit - I am a loyal AA flyer so won't say that I will fly other airlines - but when I fly on an Air Canada commuter jet that has built in IFE on a flight from YYZ to PHL and an AA widebody doesn't have it, I begin to wonder.  Happy flying."
14948,The business class from Zurich to JFK was wonderful.  Lots of room and very comfortable seats. This new modern arrangement is a great improvement over the prior configuration.
14949,I'm pleased to report American is now using this plane for it's DFW to OGG service.  The seats were outstanding and the service was great.  The complaints I've read of others about this plane's first class service is unreasonable at best.  Actually looking forward to our return flight after a great time in Maui.
14950,"My partner and I flew the LHR-ORD on flight 87 we were in seats 13A and 13B. The seats are narrow but the leg room is good (see uploaded photos) only drawback is there is a box in front of 13B foot area so you have to stretch your legs to the left a bit to get them fully stretched. Seats are a bit narrow but arm rest does raise, its a bit tricky to get the aisle arm rest to raise but it can be done. Proximity to the lavatories wasn't a problem for us.  There are no seat back TV's on this flight and the persons in 12A and 12B tend to block the TV's with their heads; so I would suggest bringing an iPad or something similar to watch."
14951,Exit Isle seats shouldn't be allowed to recline!  They have all the leg room and yet were able to recline their seats practically into our laps! Absolutely rediculous on a long flight from the States to Hawaii nd back.
14952,"I flew this plane from MIA-SCL and back. It was a hellish travel experience. First, this aircraft is like something out of the distance past in air travel. If the flight had a smoking section, it would not have seemed out of place. For starters, I noticed that Business Class did not have individual video monitors! Note to self: NEVER waste money to fly C class on this plane. Unbelievable in this day in age.
On my flight to Santiago, I was in 38A. I felt like I was being flown to Guantanamo Bay and kept in a ""stress position"" for the entire flight the seat was so cramped. They served a meal - when the flight attendant asked what I wanted for dinner, I said ""More space"", and then I dropped the tray table to show him that there wasn't enough room for it to fold down all the way. Seriously. Who permits planes like this to be so cramped? I know if we had crashed landed, I would certainly burned to death as there is no way I could have extracted myself in enough time.
My flight back in 13C was marginally better. While there was much more legroom (thankfully) I agree with the this seat being mark yellow on Seat Guru -- and I could argue it should be red. The horrid sewer smell from the lavatory over my left shoulder was disgusting. The person in 13G was father from me than the toilet! DISGUSTING!
I will never willingly fly on American in this aircraft again. The only reason I did this time was because I was required to use a government contract fare. Next time I will do whatever it takes to avoid using AA or I won't make the trip.  A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE."
14953,My husband and I flew this plane from CDG-ORD.  The seats were comfortable and it was nice to have aisle access from any seat.  The service and food were fine.  I agree with the other commenters regarding even number seats.  My husband kept getting bumped by the carts and other passengers as they were boarding.  On this flight everyone took the same path and had to walk thru the Business cabin to get to their seats.  But a  minor complaint for such vastly improved comfort over Economy.
14954,"Power supply is the DC outlet (cigarette lighter style adapter needed) for all MCE seats. 1 per pair of seats, positioned below the armrest."
14955,"I don't know what all the complaining about business class is for.  I upgraded my seat for my first leg home (Zurich to JFK) and it was really comfortable with tons of room and lots of places to stash stuff.  I'm glad I followed a prior passenger's advice to take the even numbered seats as this eliminates the aisle bumping.  The staff was friendly, the food okay, and the entertainment device was fine.  I know AA has taken space away from the main cabin in all their planes, but if you're fortunate enough to get (or pay for, in my case) an upgrade, enjoy it. It's great. My only negative was no wifi. I would expect AA to have wifi on all planes these days. I know it's not an ""over water"" thing because I had wifi the whole way out to London.  It's not hard or expensive to retrofit even an older plane with wifi, so AA should just do it. I believe it's a profit center for them.  Anyway, no complaints.  The lack of wifi enabled me to enjoy my seat more."
14956,Seat is fine. The compartments for carry on luggage are extremely tiny. Do not bring carry on roller. Just small gym bags.
14957,"Rows 2, 4, 6, and 8 singles are the best. The table is on the aisle providing privacy.  If in the middle even G or odd D are preferred with larger tables and more cozy space."
14958,"I flew on this plane in both domestic J (First) and international Y (coach). I rather liked the seats in First; they are comfortable and would be excellent for a long haul flight. I'm 6'2"" and while the configuration when lying flat isn't perfect (you have to do some contortion to fit well), it's better than coach. In coach, 21H is one of the better seats. It has extra legroom, at the cost of narrower seats (although not too narrow) and poor foot space. The lack of personal in-flight entertainment is a huge knock against this aircraft however. If it's a day time flight, bring your own entertainment or you'll be bored and uncomfortable."
14959,"middle seats in the business class cabin are perfect for passengers traveling together, if you're traveling alone, you will endure very little privacy.

agree with other posts, that the even number window seats afford the most privacy as the tray table is on the aisle side, putting the seat closer to the window.

odd numbers, as stated by previous posts have the seat on the aisle side.  not as private.

seat was very comfortable, in the sleep fully flat position.  no mattress pad provided.  

decent selection of movies from IFE, however, not a fan of the portable players.

service seemed rushed.  also, tablets and headphones were collected early, probably due to the fact that nearly everyone was asleep, kinda sneaky.

overall acceptable trans-atlantic option."
14960,"These seats are sooooooo cold it feels like your legs and feet are outside the aircraft.
Very, very poor seats and still too much money for this type of seat."
14961,Seats with aisle access have more leg room than others. It varies depending on row and whether window or aisle. Suggest SG to more accurately define these J class seats.  5A (left side)has tray on left side thus more leg room when fully reclined. 7J(right side) has tray on left side and legs are greatly restricted when seat fully reclined. Like putting your legs into a tube. Unable to bring knees up when sleeping on side. See picture #9 as example.
14962,"Row 7 seats A & J only have one window right by the seat.  Other seats in the cabin have two windows.  Overhead bin space above middle rows very limited, and seatback entertainment removed from domestic flights."
14963,"I found this seat a little bit narrow, and the seat controls are always involuntarily activated by my arm, so, the seat needs to be configured often.  However, i believe that it is a nice seat and the aisle access is great for all  in business class"
14964,"Agree about Odd number seats.  They are misaligned and I had one window and 8J had windows that were right behind my seat that I had to ask to close.  Tray table are from another world, whoever designed did not think of the passenger.  On the way TO europe I got upgraded on BA and was amazing. I got upgraded to this seat and as much as I want to be proAA was so very, very sadly disappointed.  Even number seats are the way to go ONLY and even then, you can't sleep. It's so narrow you can barely turn over.  For a transAtlantic... barely, barely passable for business. DEFINITELY not first class."
14965,"The even# seats are window which is good. Allows for more personal space. Overall seat satisfaction is average.
No place for floor storage since the foot areas slope down and back. The tables are a bit quirky and difficult to use. The F/A needed help to close it. The seat adjustment controls are place right where I place my wrists and hands. This means the seat is constantly adjusting. Poor design. The worst aspect of the experience is the laptops. For the $monies expended AA missed the boat by not doing the complete job and build in the entertainment systems. Poor decision!
""Penny wise & pound foolish"" Basically a halfway upgrade!"
14966,"Very very poor legroom.  Anyone over 5'7"" should not sit in row 12.  I disagree with row 13 being yellow, i think that row should be green and row 12 yellow or red.  No noise or bother from the restrooms behind 13.  Mini cabin is quite nice."
14967,"A big improvement from AA's previous Business Class 767 product.  The lie-flat seats are a huge plus, and the all-aisle access is awesome.  A handy work table is placed next to every seat, making storage of small personal items very easy.  Samsung Galaxy Tablets are given out to all Business Class passengers.  These are alright, but I'd prefer personal TVs, as the Tabs don't have moving maps.  But, all-in-all, a fantastic seat!"
14968,"The aircraft really old, the walls were not white they were grey with darker grey spots. The toilets were old and dirty.
The food was below average and the wine collection poor.
A week before I flew EK in C-Class between DXB and DUS what a difference. We passengers should complain  about American and European carriers and not them about the Arabian carriers.
AA never again"
14969,"I appear to be in the minority, but I like this J cabin seating, with a few caveats. To me, the seats feel fairly spacious, with plenty of niches to store small items within easy reach. There are two universal AC outlets (the one by your shoulder also has a USB port), and a pretty good amount of real estate for setting your various belongings in flight. Plenty of legroom (I'm 6'-1) and elbow room. 2J does not have overhead storage due to equipment above the seat, but I had no problems finding room in the bin behind or across from the seat.

As mentioned above, even-numbered seats on the windows, and odd-numbered seats in the middle offer the most ""seclusion"", as the wide armrest is on the aisle. The other seats put you closer to the aisle where you will get bumped by boarding passengers.

The caveats: the tray table requires an engineering degree to understand how it deploys (I *have* an engineering degree and it took me a bit). You have to be sitting fairly upright to swing it into position (and being on the slim side will help as well), and once deployed it doesn't have the range of front-to-back travel that most other tray table configurations have; it's more that it rotates around a pivot). That said, the size was reasonable, and there is a small table that folds down from the front of the ""pod"" that is a good size for a tablet, freeing up some space on the tray table during meal service.

The most annoying thing is the seat control; it's a touchscreen placed *precisely* where you will lean your arm, resulting in frequent unintended set adjustments. Eventually, I learned to place a thin book or magazine over the controls to prevent accidental activation. Additionally, it seemed like the controls that operate specific parts of the seat would randomly not work; I usually moved the seat using the pre-sets and just stoping when it was close enough.

Can't comment on the seat as a bed; didn't use it as such.

There's no IFE at the seat, so you'll get the frequently-flaky Samsung tablets."
14970,"Booked our flight with US Airways ended up being code shared to AA instead.  Cant believe American Airlines still operate these planes. Flew from Manchester UK to Chicago, with a tv directly above my head, but the next tv too far away. I guess we have become so used to Airbus 330's with seatback entertainment it was like stepping back in time to the 1990's. Really dreadful on a long flight. Wont be flying AA again."
14971,"Well, I had this seat on this new plane going from ORD-CDG and it was amazing. The flight attendant asked me my name and remembered it for the whole flight. The new Business Class is a big step up from the old one. My parent was traveling for business a lot and got stuck in the old V1 and she said it was awful and cramped. This new Business Class is a big step up and I love all the personal space it gives you. Yes, I was on the aisle side, but that didn't bother me. On the way back, there was a big difference on quality, because when I was coming back, I had the V1, and it was as cramped as my parent said it was. This is a big step forward American, so please keep going forward!"
14972,"I flew with my wife and 4 yr old and 10 month old JFK-MAD and chose row 13 rather than 20 (bassinet/bulkhead option) because the armrests are immovable in 20. Our 4 yr old could then lay on one of our laps in row 13. There was only DC power in this cabin on my aircraft, so be advised to bring the correct adapter! Also note that close location to the bathroom is a factor. Most flyers 'slam' the door shut and this can be trying! The bathroom door on the left side of our aircraft opens so that the light shines into MCE rather than the galley. Otherwise A/V needs to be upgraded to on demand. While I'm not a fan of Iberia, their new A330-300 planes have options to offer that top my AA 767 experience."
14973,"These are terrible business class seats.  Very narrow, tray tables are on a hair trigger (when not broken which they often are) and no in seat entertainment.  AA should fire the person that selected these seats"
14974,"It was a normal economy seat. However, there is a tv right over seat 29 E, so be warned"
14975,"Although the upgraded business product is much improved over the old business product, the plane is still old.  The new business class had about 30% of the seats with inoperable tray tables.  My seat had a working tray table, but like others, the table kept popping out throughout the flight.  Just touch the edge of the table and it ejects from the storage area and pops out into your lap/leg if you're sleeping.  For those without working tray tables, passengers were balancing trays of food on their laps for the meal services; definitely NOT a premium product.  Also, this particular plane did not have working inflight power so the Samsung tablets were not handed out.  Makes for a LONG 10+ hour flight without any kind of entertainment at all.  Advice: bring a fully charged device with a couple movies if you would like to watch something other than the seat back for 10 hours!"
14976,"I would change 2J to yellow or green/yellow - there is no overhead storage available, as it is taken up by emergency equipment.  Luckily the crew let me put my bags in the closet which is right in front of 2J.  I really like this plane especially for domestic trips, but am confused why they didn't use the same seating and entertainment as the new 777s.  There are no individual AVOD screens, the audio controls are in a panel that you have to reach around to access, and you almost need an engineering degree to figure out the tray table.  Other than that, it is a huge improvement over the old 767 configuration and very nice to stretch out without anybody climbing over you."
14977,I went on this plane from MXP to JFK. Plane is horrible. Only 1 meal on this 8 hour flight. No entertainment except for a few overhead screens and you only watch 2 movies because the crew rest in the middle of the flight. No legroom and width.
14978,"Worse Busiess Class seat ever, if your table is on window side of seat get ready to get hit by everything and everone in the aisle. Seat width is awful, blanket is plastic. I am a 3 million mile American Flyer and this is my end of flying American"
14979,"Flew MIA-SCL on this seat. Loved the fact that the seat itself is closer to the window and the console separates it from the isle, which is good for when sleeping. Nice space and amenities."
14980,"My first experience yesterday with the updated 763.  In a couple of words...cramped and cheezy.  No seat pitch at all and your legs end up in a black hole.  Bed close to flat but the entire experience was like what I imagine being in a coffin would be.  Tray table kept popping out unexpectedly, had to twist and turn to use storage and the work area...can't believe I'm saying this but the old angled beds in the pods were perferable.  If Spirit had business class, it would look like this."
14981,"Select a window seat in even rows for more privacy Armrest and work area are on aisle side
and passenger is closest to window.

For more work and storage space while selecting an aisle seat, pick an even row, seat G.  When selecting an odd row seat, chose a seat on the left side (D) Otherwise work area is smaller."
14982,"some of the D/G seats are better than others.  OVerall, this is a much better configuration but the trays suck and get in the way.  
Seats 2G, 4G, 6G, and 8G along with 3D, 5D and 7D have more table/storage space for your stuff than their opposing seats.  They also offer a buffer between you and the aisle so it's more peaceful when trying to sleep or avoid a cart bump."
14983,"Flew on this upgraded version of 767-300 from MIA to MXP on Jan 3, 2014. This version is far better than the previous one, that I flew on my way from MXP to MIA.
Here you get a comfortable seat that goes fully flat (although I am not sure it is 180°), there is AC outlet with a socket that fits any standard (UK, US, Europe), space for working and resting. Definitely a good experience, the opposite of the previous flight. The trouble is that you do not know in advance which version AA is going to use"
14984,"I am a frequent flier with AA, and AA has finally upgraded their 763s.  The last time I flew one of these, it was a horrendous time machine back to the 80s with terribly overpriced and uncomfortable ""business"" class seats.  I just flew DFW-MAD and AA has finally made the upgrade.  The plane was renovated, comfortable, business class feels like first class, the staff was friendly and food great.  I will no longer shy away from AA's 763s as this was a great experience."
14985,"Sat in first row of Premium Economy in middle section.  Has tons of leg room and when overhead bins are stowed, you can completely stand up with plenty of headroom.   Premium Economy section had no one else in center section and only a few on the side sections.  Video screen arm does impede a bit on your seat width at knee area but no big deal.  First rows have leg rests which are much better than the other rows and no one reclining into your space.  The only downside was the service.  It was not bad, just at times it took a long time to get anything since they seemed to always be way back in the plane and didn't notice the lights in the somewhat isolated mini cabin of PE."
14986,"Chose last row on right side of plane in case of an equipment change to Zodiac seat version.  Thankfully I had the B/E version.  Seat was good.  Service was great.  Food was good.  Nice Bang & Olufsen headphones.  Cabin was very quiet.  Seat can be a bit tricky to use, sometimes have to extend it almost completely flat to get it to go back upright."
14987,"This plane appeared to be a newer version of the 772. Instead of the roomy style of the older 772s, this seating style seems cramped, very small shelf, tiny side pocket, no side armrest that opens for storage. And it was back and forward seating arrangement."
14988,Doesn’t have a window!!
14989,"Had this seat on my flight from HNL to DFW. Extra leg room was great. Foot rest was helpful.
The down side was the support bar for the row 14 which blocked my ability to fully use the under seat storage. Also hard to access USB port and headphone jack which were located in the back of the center arm rest."
14990,"Nice seat if the disembark from the second exit.  Quick release!  Slightly smaller cabin from the front.  Switched from 1D to 8A to have a single, window seat.  Glad i did."
14991,"Premium economy. Plenty of room both leg and recline. However my biggest complaint was the positioning of the power and headphone sockets. They are tightly positioned behind your right elbow, under the seat seperator. Good luck fidding. I lost more than hour trying and gave up in favour of my beats"
14992,"This is a great Business Class seat.  The bulkhead immediately in front provides a more private feeling, and because there is no seat in front of it, there is a handy extra shelf to place things such as empty wine glasses, where the next seat in front would normally be.  Proximity to galley and lavatories was no problem - slept 4 hours on a daytime flight!"
14993,These are 2 seats in the Main Cabin extra economy section with extra leg room.  Please see the pictures I have submitted.  The privacy for 2 people and the ample leg room are worth the slightly narrowed seats due to the armrests that contain the seat trays.
14994,"Among the Premium Economy seats, these two seats are separated from Economy by the bulkhead. No one pulls your seat from behind when you are eating or sleeping. Any of the Premium Economy seats didn't have enough recline for a comfortable rest but for 7 to 8-hour flight between JFK/CDG back to JFK, it was fine."
14995,I found the new Premium Economy seat to be comfortable and I was able to sleep through most of this red-eye flight. American's cabin staff were helpful and friendly and the food was quite tasty for airline fare.  No problem storing carry-ons despite being a full flight. The 777-200 is a fabulous aircraft.
14996,Excellent seat. Way more legroom than the rest of the cabin (bulkhead rows). Extra footrest as well. Well worth the extra money on DFW-Hawaii routes. Highly recommend.
14997,Is good and have a window but have a bathroom sound!
14998,"Great legroom and there is a cutout in the bulkhead to allow for storage under the seat in front.  The cutout is only about a foot high (if that), so you can't fit a very deep bag under there.  A backpack fit just fine.  Poor seat width due to the aircraft configuration (10 seats wide in economy) and tray table within the armrest.

I would choose this seat again."
14999,"Nice economy plus seat with foot rest, pillow and blanket"
15000,"Great lie-flat seat for LAX-MIA. Each is like a private pod. We had 1D and 1H. Unlike previous reviews, there was no divider separating them, so we could turn and see each other. Seats 1A and 1J are nearly a row behind, so seats 1D and H have total privacy at the front of the cabin.  Several storage drawers reveal a tv remote control, charging outlets, headphone outlets and amenity kit.  The aisle-side drawer reveals Bose noise-cancelling headphones which the flight attendant collects before landing. The aisle armrest raises and lowers for desired height.  We had no issues with the forward lavatory being in front of us and found it very convenient.  No one ever stood near our seats.  We would definitely select these seats again and hope to be in them again for a longer flight!"
15001,"Had flight 5, seat 5D,  DFW to HNL. Wonderful seat (even with no window view), bathroom was awesome, food and tv / movie selection was great. Permanently ruined flying anything but first class for me on 3+ hour trips and we will purposely select the 777 for travel out and back next time we go to the islands. WAY better than the 757 ""first class"" we had overnight on the way back."
15002,Private seat but only 1 window.  Noise from lavatory.
15003,"Sat in 13J and 13L from DFW to HNL, and the same seats back from HNL to DFW.  Flight numbers AA 5 and AA 8.  From DFW to HNL the space from the seat to bulkhead was a good 6""  more than the flight from HNL to DFW.  So the leg space for Row 13 is different per airplane even though it's the same 777-200 V2 layout.  The Premium Economy product was good although since this is considered a domestic flight you DO NOT get upgraded meals, nor a Bose headset, like you do on International PE flights.  Not having under seat storage in front of you was not an issue because the overhead compartments in this cabin and reserved for PE customers only, so carry on space was not an issue.  For taller people, the Row 13 leg rests are useless, but for a shorter person, like my wife, it was perfect and comfortable. The infotainment TV was great and functional.  The seat width, privacy, location, and comfort were all great.  Overall, if you don't mind paying a slightly overpriced premium for these PE seats, I'd recommend Row 13 over Rows 14 and 15 due to increased leg space and overall moving space."
15004,"Seat is great, galley is no issue."
15005,DFW to HNL was great in BC. 1H has lots of room and was very comfortable. Very quiet and private as it was actually slightly ahead of 1A & 1L.
15006,24C and 24J do not recline and everything going down the aisle bumps you
15007,Sat in business class between DFW and Maui. Highly recommend BC. I didn't feel exhausted after flying 7+ hrs because I was able to stretch out the entire flight. I flew backwards going to Maui and it felt weird. BC has two sections. I recommend the first section as there's more privacy and not as bright as the second section.
15008,"Really happy with these business class seats 3L & 4L.  Very confortable, storage on side near window, not very deep, but very convenient. People with size 13+ shoes may have issues fitting feet under the console."
15009,"I am extremely large and crippled with osteo arthritis.I found 5A to be the perfect seat for my return flights between Heathrow and Raleigh in May. The closest to the cabin door, with only 4 steps from the cabin door, and three to the toilet. Comfortable seat and good view from the window. AA crew very helpful"
15010,"CDG-MIA 3 pax; for 14L good legroom ( I am 6'2"") and seat comfort for 9.5 hr flight. Nice amenity kit w bigger pillow and overear headphones. 13J almost 5 ft of legroom to bulkhead.Overhead bins say reserved for PE which is nice, hold 2 rollaboards sideways.Overall very satisfied with PE."
15011,"Massive aircraft.  Wonderfully quiet.  Had seats 17A,C,J,L.   Tons of legroom.  Absolutely no hip room.  Crew was rude and unapologetic.  Gentleman behind us in row 18 got bashed by the service cart and was not even acknowledged.  Free drinks in MCE now.   So that was a +."
15012,"My husband and I sat in seats 17A and 17C on our return to DFW from Maui.  They were excellent seats for a 6+ hour flight.  We had no one sitting beside us, so it was easy to get up to use the restroom.  They are bulkhead seats, so we had to place our items overhead for takeoff and landing, but not a big problem.  The window view is ""OK"".  The seats are over a wing, but we were still able to view a beautiful sunset.  I would select these seats again."
15013,"We sat in 18K & 18L and had someone next to us at 18J. I'm 5'9"" and legroom was great. Since there isn't a seat in front of 18J, I was able to get in and out of the row without bugging the guy too much. He wasn't forced to get up and could just shift his body a bit which made me feel less bad and if you're looking at 18J, you wont have to worry about getting up for people. It is one of those rows where the window is closer to seat-back of the row ahead of you but that wasn't much of an issue for us."
15014,Not aligned with window and has less shoulder space
15015,"Flew on Flight 71 FRA to DFW on 4/6/2018; I'm 5'9; this seat was comfortable and the leg room was good for me. Although there were only 2 of us on this row, the other on the opposite end. The seat width was enough for me. I'm glad I was able to fly on this version for a 10hour flight."
15016,"1D is obviously a great seat since it’s in the first class cabin.  However, if you’re lucky enough to be in first, you might prefer a seat OTHER than 1D or 1G.  Both of these seats are forward of the others and thus very close to the galley and lavatories (least privacy / peace and quiet in first).  Also, there’s no dedicated overhead bin for 1D or 1G, so you’ll have to find a space somewhere else.  Still a great seat overall, of course.  But if you have a choice, you might want to pick a different one for a long flight."
15017,"Note that Rows 20 and 33 directly face divider walls. While this seems like a choice seat (since there's a little extra legroom and no one in front of you), these seats are often chosen by families with small babies since the divider wall allows a baby bassinet hookup. Beware choosing these seats or those nearby in case of screaming infants."
15018,"I didn't want a middle seat in a four (being on my own), but the front row of PE is pretty good - room to get out without disturbing the neighbour, and a foot rest, meaning the seat is a decent ""cradle"" to sleep. Service was also good - it was a relatively short night flight, and they got the food out fast, leaving a decent amount of time to sleep. 

AA is way better than BA for transatlantic, in my opinion"
15019,"This 14 hour night  flight from LAX to Hong Kong was one of the worst flights of my life.  And I have >900,000 just with American.The seat was so narrow that both of my hip bones have bruises and no  am not a big guy. Area in front zumba/yoga/stretch area all night long.  I will never fly a 777 again. I fully expect the next flight to stack passengers horizontally and spray with olive oil."
15020,"Got upgraded to this while having purchased the lowest fare class (X). This seat is by far the best on AA coach, even better than the one opposite FA's on AA's A321 (if you fly with them long enough you know). Ample legroom even with the bulkhead in front! Surprising! Would fly again."
15021,O2 stored in overhead - must share adjoining overhead
15022,"Seat Guru i think unfairly paints this seat “red”. With the acres of legroom offsetting the lack of floor storage, I’d only mark this cation yellow. I fly enough to not particularly care about the lack of a window..."
15023,"18A and 18L are the best sleeping seats in PE.  No one behind you to pull on the seat in the middle of the night (there's a divider to Main Cabin), and no one to climb over you when you're sleeping."
15024,By far the best seat in basic economy.  Great legroom and having the seat hug the wall (as opposed to Boeing 747 seat 51 J which has a large gap between the window seat and the wall) allows for extra comfort.
15025,"This seat does not recline and the arm rests cannot be moved.  I had an empty row for this flight, but could not lift the arm rests to enjoy the room."
15026,Premium Economy set 16C is very comfortable. Lots of leg room and has a foot rest. Downside is you are sup post to get a warm towel and warm nuts on takeoff but cot a tiny bag of pretzels
15027,"This is a good seat with great leg room.  It does however, as the review says, gets very cold due to the exit door.  Grab extra blankets to wrap up in."
15028,"The seat map is a bit misleading because 4A is set further back (i.e. towards the rear) vis-a-vis 4D (whereas the seat map seems to show they are next to each other).  Although that means 4A is in reality even closer to the lavatory and the galley, they are still a sufficient distance away so as not to become a nuisance.  I slept very well throughout the flight.  I find the mini-cabin (rows 3 and 4) to be better than the larger cabin.  Although 3A would be better than 4A, I don't think 4A is any worse than 6A or 7A, for example.  In other words, I wouldn't place 4A in the ""yellow"" category."
15029,"The narrowest seats I've ever seen in an intercontinental flight. I am not so big (42"" waist) and had to ask for a seat belt extension. 
PS: The conection flights (Airbus 321) were  a lot more confortable - and I had at least 10"" to ""spare"" on the seat belts!"
15030,"Very narrow seat. I'm 1.83m tall and legroom is extremely reduced to me. In case I decide to store my pillow in the seat pocket, well I would be stuck there. Another problem I always have with American is the seat width. I know I have large shoulders, fine, but in case I get a same size person (as It happened), we could barely fit. I strongly recommend to get an aisle, or main cabin extra."
15031,"First time on the 777-300ER and enjoyed the Premium Economy offering. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and service on board and was able to get comfortable and enjoy the ride. The only disappointment was the inflight entertainment system, it does not have anywhere near the volume of programming previously available."
15032,"The seat is far from the airplane wall, so you cannot lay your body on the window. Also, it does not fully recline."
15033,"Main cabin extra seat and the extra room was noticeable.  Restricted recline, same as all their seats.  Padding was thin and relatively uncomfortable.  The one quirky thing was the seat is slightly offset from the tray table, so you have to slightly angle yourself to use the tray.  Still I would take this seat in a minute over regular coach. Also, I noticed that in the row ahead, 31 there was tons of legroom, but people were queued up for the lavs for a significant portion of the flight and some stood directly in front of those seats."
15034,"Great size seat, good food, good interaction with a fun cheeky flight attendant. I really enjoyed turning the seat sideways and watching out the windows as we descended along the California coast into LAX."
15035,"The exit door does reduce some of the space, but the trick is to put your roller board case down in front of you after take off. If you are travelling with someone, you can put it down horizontally (wheels facing the door)  and both can use as footrest). This allows you to prop your feet up as a foot rest but more importantly, it keeps people from congregating in front of you so it is the best way to maximize space. The tray table is a bit low so when you are eating you must be careful about moving. The light from the bathroom is opposite so every time some one goes in or out it will shine in your face. On the 777-200 the bathroom was on the same side so light would not be a bother. All and all 31a and 31j are the only seats I fly on this plane in economy."
15036,"Coach on AA is a miserable experience, though seat 31A provides a little relief in the way of unlimited legroom.  The exit slide on the emergency door bulges out into the space, but there is still plenty of legroom, and (unless the FA gripes at you) can use it as a ""footstool"" to put your feet up.  The proximity to the galley and lav is somewhat annoying, but didn't cause any major issues. No window, though the window in 32A is easy to look through over you left shoulder.  Still not a fun experience, but I guess it was worth the additional $ for the extra legroom."
15037,"Flew from LHR to Dallas in basic economy. If American Airlines could have got these seats any closer/tighter in basic economy they might as well have had you standing up. No leg room whatsoever,  no width, crammed in. Most miserable 9 hours flight I have ever taken. I guess you get what you pay for! Upgrade or fly in an Airbus, much more comfortable."
15038,"Above 6A the airline has used the overhead bin space for emergency equipment, so there is no overhead bin space above this seat"
15039,"Frequently fly this plane hkg-lax and hkg-dfw. My favorite business class seat and this is a big achievement as it easily beats singapore's, uniteds, deltas, turkish's long haul business class and ties with emirates and cathay pacific. Snacks are great and flight attendants really caring. We actually ran out of gas one time from dfw-hkg and had to stop at narita"
15040,Overhead locker above seat has what appears to be oxygen so not available fir luggage storage.
15041,"Just finished a turnaround MR to HKG on the 77W both ways. I am BIG--6'5' and 300 so room is a must. 
seat cushion length is great (compared to JL and CX where it seems short) blanket and amenities are nice; food MUCH improved over coach; Sort of nice having a semi-dedicated bathroom at front of cabin.  
Came back via DFW--16E--exit row but in the four abreast section. I had horrors of this seat, but it wasn't bad--more leg room than I would ever use..easy egress and ingress.  Crew much more friendly and very pleasant, proactive and service-oriented.
The other rows had more legroom but seemed rather cramped, still.  People had to climb over others, so not sure I would do those rows"
15042,"Just finished a turnaround MR to HKG on the 77W both ways. I am BIG--6'5' and 300 so room is a must. 
From LAX, had exit row, 16B.  Unlimited legroom; no problem with bathroom lines or use; leg rest wasn't useful--due to leg length and not AA's fault.;seat cushion length is great (compared to JL and CX where it seems short) blanket and amenities are nice; food MUCH improved over coach; Sort of nice having a semi-dedicated bathroom at front of cabin.  
The other rows had more legroom but seemed rather cramped, still.  People had to climb over others, so not sure I would do those rows.
For the extra dollars and assuming not upgrade available, a great product"
15043,"Strong smell from bathrooms behind row 19. Also row 19 does not recline as much as row 16,17 and 18."
15044,"The seat has no window, but for an overnight flight, the extra legroom is fantastic. You can sleep well against the wall. You have it as a red seat. I would tell you that it is a green seat."
15045,The overhead bin os used for oxygen tanks and cant be used!
15046,"I flew from DFW to LHR in seat 20C and back in 20D. While there is a bulkhead in front on row 20, this bulkhead does not extend all the way to the floor, it stops about 6 inches above the floor. There is therefore plenty of room to stretch your legs underneath the bulkhead and even store carry on items. It was one of the best coach seats I have ever had for a transatlantic crossing."
15047,"LHN to DFW, 10/8/18.  For as many times as I have flown AA, this was one of the most enjoyable and comfortable flights I have ever experienced.  My seat was very comfortable with plenty of room and plenty of seat position options.  The AVOD system offers a very good choice of movies and the screen quality and size is excellent,  Our flight attendant, Danial, was exceptional.  The food was surprisingly good."
15048,"noise from the galley (silverware being handled, flight attendants chating, etc) is very disturbing."
15049,"Caution.  No window.  Lavatory light and traffic a problem on overseas trips.  Worst of all, the airplane door juts out from the side of the plane and gives tall guys no room to put their legs."
15050,"Beware.  Armrests do not move.  Very narrow.  If you are over 6'2"" it will be a nightmare flight overseas.  And this is with an empty seat next to me."
15051,Nice seat but be aware the storage above this seat is full of oxygen tanks and therefore not available for luggage.  You're left hoping space is available above another seat.
15052,Nice seat but be aware the storage above this seat is full of oxygen tanks and not available for luggage.  You're left hoping there is storage above another seat.
15053,"Very comfortable seat. No issues at all with noise or light from galley or lavatory. In fact the proximity is actually a convenience. Lav on A/D is normal size - the lav on G/J size is large. As someone mentioned, there is a constant swoosh of airflow from the AC  system overhead."
15054,"Great seat. Good service, good food. Im 200cm and didnt have any issues with space. Choice of entertainment was ok. Definitely flying again in AA PremEco"
15055,"I flew to HKG round trip in the new Premium Economy seat 18L as a solo traveler.  Going to HKG on a red eye, the PE cabin was only 1/4 full so 18J was empty, making it a comfortable flight.  On the way back, the flight was full and I had a stranger next to me.  Passengers in front of me had their seats on full recline for the entire 15 hour flight and the gentleman next to me refused to stand up out of his seat when I had to get up, instead insisting on merely tucking his legs in (!?) to let me pass.  THIS WAS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE and highly uncomfortable to do.  If you are a solo traveler - do not sit in 18L - sit in 18J.  I wanted a window seat but 18J is just as good - as it's over the wing anyway (not much to see) AND the left arm rest goes completely down so you can get more comfortable with your legs if you're trying to sleep."
15056,"JFK-LHR. This is a great seat. Comfortable, lots of storage, with first class cordoned off it's also quiet. Pre-ordered my meal (delish, but I'm weird, I like airplane food), watched a movie, and went to sleep for several hours. Only down side- unlike first class, no pajamas. We rode on a BA 747 on the way back home- this seat is far superior."
15057,"The storage bin over 7A (and probably the seat on the other side, too) is occupied by the oxygen tanks so it cannot be used for storage."
15058,"The airline continues to show this seat separated from 21C with a gap.  There is no gap, and so the agents and customer service personnel at the airline try to relocate passengers to this seat as ""better"". (I even showed them your website with no gap.) Please note this somehow in seatguru, so that there is no question for the customers.  Thank you."
15059,"This was a very comfortable seat. Good recline, and I loved the large IFE screen. Only negative is that it's a bit difficult to reach the headphone jack (at the back of the armrest tray table). As someone who rarely travels in First or Business, this is a nice compromise for me on a simple trans-Atlantic trip. The 2-4-2 config and foot rest ""pedals"" alone make it worth the modest seat upgrade fee. I'll do this again in a heartbeat."
15060,"Flew from Sao Paulo to Dallas.  As others have said, the economy seats are very tight.  I am only 5'6"" but felt squeezed in despite having an aisle seat. The gentleman next to me in 26E bumped into me a few times while trying to get comfortable.  The IFE system was good, and the bathrooms were clean and spacious.  Overall, an uncomfortable flight and slept very little."
15061,"Great seat. Slept for 6 good hours. Good IFE. Food was good quality. Great flight, no complaints. So much nicer than the BA Business which is too cramped for a tall pax to lie down or sleep. Top marks AA."
15062,"My 777 300 was the latest configuration with Premium Economy seating, currently sold as Coach. Whilst not a Premium Cabin as you cannot lie down, it does represent a substantial improvement over the rest of the coach cabin. I found the seat very comfortable, reminiscent of domestic first class, the IFE was very good and I was not troubled at all by the closeness of the Bathrooms. The leg room in this row has always been superb."
15063,AWESOME SEAT! Best flight I have been on yet. DFW-LHR flagship first.
15064,"21L:   BE FOREWARNED:  At least for me and the gentleman next to me, we were duped (by the AA seat map of this plane) into thinking that this row and the opposite side (21A/B) were only two across. We both payed extra for this in thinking so.  Now this might be a case where they were switching equipment for the flight, but the SeatGuru seat map IS accurate where the AA site (at least at the time of booking -- and right up to the day of flight) was NOT.  In our case the tall guy beside me (thinking he was in an aisle seat but ended up in a middle) rightly complained to the Flight Attendant before we took off, I also complained to re-enforce his grief as well as mine -- again, we both payed 150 to 200 extra for what amounted to standard economy seats whose only real benefit was that they were a little closer to the front of the economy section.   In our case, we were taken care of:  They guy to my left was re-seated to main cabin extra, and I got what I wanted: a row with only two people sitting in it.  You may not be as fortunate!  You've been warned."
15065,"I've flown 9D and 13D on this plane. Specific to this seat, 1). I think the business class seats half-way back are the best because they're far enough away from the galleys/lavs and receive less light as a result.  2) The center seats are in some ways less private but really, they way they're configured, you cannot see the person next to you unless you lean way forward.  In general: This business class configuration is ideal and I really can't see the benefit of First Class over this.  I like that the 777s give you an additional air control if you want it, I like a lille air circulation when I sleep.  The service is perfect and I love this herring bone model where one never has to bother another passenger to get up. There is a decent feeling of privacy.  As others have said you may be more comfortable sleeping if you flatten the seat all the way, then raise it ever so lightly to get the bump out of it.  I fly from LAX to HK and back two times a year and for my money, this seat is exactly what I need to be able to hit the ground running."
15066,"By far the best transatlantic business seat in the air.  Mini cabin is great - only 8 seats and insulated from rest of business.  Best lav is behind 4J - huge.  As a daytime flight, did not mind the frequent banging by FA in the nearby galley - but they must try hard to make so much noise!"
15067,"Business class seat 3D, front mini cabin.  Love the 777300ER business seats, I chose 3D thinking it would be more intimate, quieter. It wasn't what I expected.  The noise from the air vent was quite loud for much of the flight and blew right on this seat. Also, the FAs were slamming doors in the galley for hours.  Also, when I got up during the flight, all the FAs were gathered in the area of the galley, laughing and talking.  I will choose a seat back in the middle as before.  Service was fine and attentive but the added noise of the galley made for a restless night."
15068,"Great seat for couples but also single flyers. Being right behind the row of three seat means extra space and nobody comes close to bumping you walking back and forth. There is a small gap between the window and 41L but it's not that large and acted as more storage. Leg room seems more than other rows due to angle of plane. These are the best economy seats, only downside is they run out of food options but the FA's were thoughtful and offered us the second meal options first."
15069,"Flew LHR-DFW 777-300 3/27/18.  Definitely the best US domestic business class seat.  Incredibly comfortable, very private, lots of storage space.  Tons of current movies and shows.  Pre-ordered beef tenderloin lunch, it was flavorful and not over-cooked. Great seat if you are traveling with a companion.  Flight attendants were outstanding.....thanks for making the flight so great!!!"
15070,Love this plane and seat. 8J was very private and the seat comfortable. Had great wine and food in my own little pod. The trip from LHR to JFK went so fast between the movies and the Wonderful Staff. Keep up the Good Work American Airlines.
15071,"We flew AA from LAX to HKG. We were on a 777-300ER seats 40A and 40B. These seats DID NOT recline, and the arm rest was also fixed. We asked our neighbor at 40C with the same thing. For 15 hours, we sat straight up. We wanted to change seats but flight attendant said the flight was full."
15072,Great seat with lots of leg room & space.
15073,"In the middle section, there are 3 places for 4 people to stow items under the seat in front of them.  In EF and G seats you have to straddle the support of the seats in front of you and share a leg space with your fellow passenger.  Not ideal!"
15074,"This plane is now configured for Premium Economy in Rows 16-18. Seating reminiscent of Domestic First Class. I do not buy Premium Economy as it is just a race to the bottom by the likes of Virgin and BA. For me it is Coach for low cost or Business/First if I need to sleep.  That said it was another excellent product from American and at regular Coach price it was a good deal. Food was usual airline coach class fare but I carry my own as a Vegetarian. With the usual personal items I fly with this was perfectly acceptable for a working flight of 11 hours. I arrived feeling great. 16,000 miles in five days and no ill effects. Why I fly AA TATL."
15075,"In Feb 2017, we flew with this plane to MIA from LHR. We had the middle 4 -seats (me + wife + 13 y + 7 y) Plane was really full, all seats taken. I'am 6""1 tall and it took a bit organizing to sit on the seat but it can be done. A bit tight but what can you expect from economy class? Service was ok,normal food and soda, kids were served really well by staff (which is not the case always). I was not able to sleep in this seat but fortunately there was movies etc in the media system."
15076,"The worst flying experience for this JFK-LHR.
The fellow passenger in 29C overspilt and we had to fight for space beacuse the width is the smallest ever. Shame on American! Very unpleasant experience, I will definitely try and avoid this plane in the future."
15077,I have never felt so claustrophobic on an airplane (and I am a very regular flyer). All Economy passengers are packed in incredibly tightly. Quite scary!
15078,"This is the first seat in the Biz ""mini"" cabin. It was definitely very private on a redeye from LAX-LHR. That said, the comments about the loud air vent are true. However, I used the provided earplugs in the amenity kit and was able to get a little bit of sleep."
15079,The seat is right in between windows so you won't get a lot of arm room. It felt a bit cramped.
15080,"Good, well modeled, great value"
15081,At front it is quiet.
15082,"Very happy with the small cabin, felt like personalized service. Frist class has a partition and the bathroom and galley separates the other business class so you truly felt like your own cabin with 7 other people. I had no issues with the bathroom being close. I heard noise from the galley only during meal service and only from one FA who wanted to slam doors. The bed isn't the most comfortable (a little tight) but I was able to sleep a whole 5 hours which is a miracle for me. Food was much better than my 767 flight a few days earlier and the bathroom was larger, still nothing to be excited for."
15083,This seat is right under a LOUD LOUD LOUD aircon or something right above the lavatory.  Stay away from this whole row. Terrible.
15084,"The proximity to the lavatories pretty much negates the huge legroom benefits. I had this seat overnight from Buenos Aires to Miami, and the light and noise from everyone going in and out of the rest room kept me up all night. Lines and queues formed in my personal space. The seat is also very narrow, and the armrest tray table is about the size of a postage stamp. It felt like a tight squeeze, which was unfortunate for an exit row seat. I wouldn't sit here again."
15085,"Word of caution- great legroom but this seat does not recline. The space in front of the seat is the defacto queue for the restroom so people are hovering in front of your seat pretty much all night and were a much bigger issue than the light. Finally decided leave my entertainment unit up as a visual block to people. Pros-legroom. Cons-thin  & narrow seat, no recline, bumped almost entire flight by passengers waiting for bathroom.


Still better the nonMCE but would not choose this seat ahain unless nothung else available."
15086,"We flew 11 hours on this flight LHR-LAX. Was so impressed with American! I felt like I was on British Airlines 777 in first class minus the $500 taxes. Very private comfortable and exceptional service. So happy we chose seats 4D/G despite the negative commnts.  Its further away from the huge row of other business seats. You feel like your part of first class. The noise was from the plane itself not from lavatory or galley. With the Bose noise cancelling headphones they provide you, I dont know how you can complain. Food was not as great as British but again I only paid $50 in taxes versus $500 so no big deal.  Cant wait to fly this plane again!"
15087,"Upgraded to these seats many weeks before the flight and was looking forward to this location in the forward mini Business cabin, just behind FC; unfortunately my wife's seat (3D) had a malfunctioning seat, which they tried to fix (Unsuccessfully); so we both moved to seats 8 D&E, which were okay, less privacy than row 3; everything else was okay, except the food was horrible sorry to say!"
15088,"Loved the upgrade to business, we were the last upgrade on this flight; the pods are the only way to travel even on a 7 hour flight JFK-LHR; with all the positives, the negatives are as discussed previously proximity to lavs (noise and lights) were problematic and certainly not a seat you want to choose, if you have the opportunity dont sit here, unless its the only upgrade seats, then take them. Service was good, food was good, privacy is good, video devices were very good. Thanks AA for the upgrade"
15089,"Very comfortable seat in both sitting and flat position.
Service was excellent and everything about the flight was good. AA biz class on 773 will be my first choice for MIA-LHR in future.
Getting really picky, it would be nice if the pillows were a bit more substantial. I folded mine in half which worked just fine."
15090,"The right hand armrest is immoveable but the left does move.

Row 33 has bassinet hooks."
15091,"My seat in First Class was nowhere near as nice as most airlines. This was not a pod or enclosed suite and did not have a closing wall like a few of AA flights do.
I was extremely disappointed in the comfort of the seat considering this was first class.

The ""bedpad"" was nothing more than a thin mattress pad that provided no comfort at all and the seat adjust buttons never truly worked easily. They would always get stuck and you would need to keep pressing.

The food was the most offensive issue and was some of the worst I have ever experienced on a long haul first class flight. Dried out chicken, small servings, microwave TV dinner style sliders were horrible. Even the flight attendant commented how embarrassed she was with the food.

American really needs to step up their service for First Class but from what I am hearing it will all be eliminated soon to only a two class airline. Business and Coach."
15092,Absolutely the smallest space alloted to a passenger i have ever experienced.HORRIBLE!
15093,"Flew RT from MIA to LHR on this plane in seat 10A both ways AA flights 38 & 39.  Loved the seat and had no complaints.  Can be a little bit tight at times but for a business class seat can't complain at all. Nice privacy, good entertainment options, good service both ways, especially LHR>MIA.  Would fly this product again."
15094,"Seat has good recline but tight leg space. Good part is only one person sitting next to you, you are also sitting close to bathrooms for easy access"
15095,"Seat has good recline but tight leg space. Good part is only one person sitting next to you, you are also sitting close to bathrooms for easy access"
15096,"Tremendous seat, unbelievable service, and fantastic privacy for a biz class seat. One comment - there's a hump in the seat when fully flat.  Crank up the seat a small bit and it goes away.  I found no issues with the proximity of the head near the aisle.  The bulkhead between your head and the aisle maintains the privacy and quiet I needed to get a good night's rest. There are two overhead vents which allowed you to control your seat temp which is huge.   LOVED this seat."
15097,"LAX-LHR in 15G was fantastic. Business class on this airframe is phenomenal and super private. Im 6'5"" and was able to sleep about 5 hours straight after dinner. This particular seat is the last row in Biz class which puts you right next to the lav but honestly it was very lightly used throughout the flight so I had no issues with foot traffic. I actually found it handy being just 2 steps away from the bathroom. Bose headsets worked like a charm as did IFE. Nothing bad to say about this. Anyone who complains about business class on this airplane should probably just buy a private jet because youre not going to find anything much better than this short of your own plane."
15098,"Armrests for seats 40A, 40B, 40C, 40J, 40K, and 40L are fixed and do not move up. Fine if travelling alone or don't want a little extra space on this already cramped configuration."
15099,"We sat in 16 D,E,H on the way out we did not have the problem of people walking in front that some mentioned other than at boarding but noticed that others did on the return. There was good space and the recline was excellent, staff were fantastic I liked the food but the rest of my family did not.  The toilets did not bother us but the TV that is in the arm does not work until after the seatbelt sign is taken off where as all others are gate to gate, the tray was half the size of a normal tray which did prove slightly difficult. All in all its better than a standard economy seat and its good not having a seat recline in front of you but its not without disadvantages as well."
15100,"Legroom was great as there was no mediabox on the floor. I could almost stretch entirely. As for the seat itself, it was horrible. I'm 6 foot 4 and the seat was way too low. To put my head against the headrest I had had to tilt my head 90 degrees, which makes it impossible to sleep. IFE was great although it is a bit unresponsive and slow. No trouble with the near lavatories, as there is only one and is mostly used by people in the back of the plane."
15101,"While this is a great seat in the forward mini-business class cabin, there are two things to point out. FA's use this seat for storage...there's a closet on the bulkhead so don't be surprised to see an FA there during the flight. Also, there is a screen above this seat that displays the moving map. While not completely bothersome, the light from the TV may be annoying when all the lights are turned down."
15102,1D and 1G have no overhead stow bins
15103,"Very uncomfortable. Due to Bulkhead behind us,seats had little to no recline. Flight was from London to DFW. Leg room was OK, but the lack of recline made this seat almost unbearable for a 9 hour flight"
15104,Great seat. The individual POD design and lack of seat mate made this a great business class seat. Only set back is that by angling the feet towards the window your head is in the aisle when sleeping. This can make for interrupted sleep if a lot of people are walking to the bathroom or gallery. Service was exceptional and the seat had plenty of storage space.
15105,Seat as less leg room then normal. Problematic for tall people (like me 2 meter). I had one finger between my knee and the seat in front of me.
15106,"The First Class seat was spacious and had enough room so that I could lie flat, even being over 6 feet tall.  The amenities offered were helpful, and plentiful, comprising all the standards - ear plugsm moisturizer, etc, but also came with a large enough tube of toothpaste that I got more than one quick brush at the end of the flight.  Unlike many first class cabins -particularly Airbus - this seat had air vents that allowed you to control if you wanted to have some air blowing on you.  This seems a minor thing, but it is a great convenience as opposed to being at the mercy of the overall cabin temperature controls.  For what was nearly an 18 hour flight (and more than 18 hours when time on the ground was included), this was a very comfortable seat with plenty of entertainment options, and power sources for devices you brought with you."
15107,"Great seat. There's plenty of room in front, and the proximity to the bathroom is not an issue."
15108,"Flew seat 8J from LAX to SYD.  Tremendous seat, no problems with foot traffic, noise, or light.  Great food and managed to sleep for about 6 hours. AA 77W must be the best business class seat out there."
15109,"Due to the curvature of the plane, row 40 is slightly angled which gave 40L (The window seat) an additional 2-3 inches of leg room, which made for an enjoyable flight. The aisle seat had reduced legroom and I would recommend avoiding it."
15110,"Nice seat. More room than other rows, however proximity to the galley can really bothersome specially if one plans to sleep."
15111,"Great seat.  Lay flat seat for a domestic flight was amazing.  Bose headphones were given out for flight to cancel noise.  Bathroom was clean, mostly unoccupied.  TV screen worked great.  This row was just south of first class but I could not say that first is any better -- perhaps they get their meals sooner and they have a smidge more legroom but that's it.  This is the bomb!"
15112,Overhead bin full with Oxygen tanks leaving no space for baggage
15113,"We were upgraded to seats 15 D & G southbound and 10 D & G northbound. These 'pods' are by far the best business class seat that I have ever used, bar none.  The inflight service was outstanding and I cannot think of anything else that could be added that would make this a better flight.  But, I do have some comments:
1.  At seat 15D, when anyone from business class opens the business class toilet, or when anyone from coach opens the coach toilet, the light shines directly on seat 15D.  Very annoying.
2.  On our southbound flight there were two infants and one toddler in the business class section about three rows ahead of us, all in the same row.  This is madness.  The ladies caring for these children were up and down all night, and I have no quarrel with them, except for the fact that they kept standing ON THE SEATS and climbing over the partitions between seats.  Why the flight attendants permitted this I will never understand.  I also do not understand why American would permit crying, screaming and running infants and toddlers in this section.  Had I paid the full price of over $6,000.00 for this seat I would have been seriously upset.  These babies belong in the coach section, where a bassinet or some other sort of crib can be set up for them.  Please American, do what Singapore Airlines did and do not permit children under the age of 16 or 18 in the business class section."
15114,"Being 5' 10"" & 260lbs, the tapering of the aircraft helps have a bit of extra room on the side, was able to fit my backpack and drinks easily. Legs are jammed up against the seat ahead of you if 5'10 or above, had no MCE's available (free as platinum) or wouldve never touched it. Would fly seat again if no better choices were available. 2 across beats any of the 3-4-3. Also 3J is pretty decent, just missing a window. 2A was good but not worth the extra over business class when business class is so great to begin with. Have flown DFW-LHR, DFW to LAX, LAX to LHR"
15115,It feels a smaller seat but it has space so you don't get hit by the cart
15116,"Very loud seat with constant banging of drawers and slamming carts into the galley.  It sometimes seemed that they were trying to be loud.  It was also very close to where the crew congregated during flight.  Also overtime the lavatory flushed, it would wake me up, even with ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones.  I would not book this seat again."
15117,"GRU (Sao Paulo/Brazil) -> MIA (Miami/FL). Overnight flight. I absolutelly second the comments already posted. You will get people bumping during all the flight. Flight attendants with carts, passengers going to lavatories and passengers ""having a walk"". Also it's close to the screens with the flight map/progress display which are very bright and disturb the eyes. The only good thing is the leg room, but even that is ""challenged"" during the flight by people passing. If you want to sleep is not a good choice unless you are a very deep sleeper. Perhaps for a flight during the day, when you will be awake and seeing movies it will be ok. Of course time by time you will have to adjust the movie screen because of... guess what? Bumping from passengers."
15118,Excellent Service from the ground to the air. Great Food and seat controls. No noise issue from the galley and easy to get sleep for a 14 hour flight from SYD to LAX. Bathrooms were modern for first class and great IFE selection. Two USB ports and to AC ports. Bose headsets were provided and collected right before decent unlike other AA flights where they are collected before breakfast. Great flight.
15119,"33J is sold as an exit row seat because there is no seat in front of it. However, your shoulder and entertainment screen do get almost constantly bumped by people passing by. The legroom is fine and it is easy to get up and stretch your legs etc but as an exit row option, this is to be avoided if others are available."
15120,"Being someone that is very happy to get an upgrade, I have flown biz class on this plane 4 times now and can truly say the business seats are AWESOME on this plane. No more angle lie flats, having the middle person hop over you, etc., etc. Bottom line, you get a pod like setup with plenty of privacy. I will be taking my 5th flight in this business class configuration and am soooo excited as I can finally get some sleep. 
Pros - LOTS of personal space/desk space. Enough Privacy to get some sleep. Nice NEWER plane layout with seats that fully lie flat.
Negative - Getting up and down requires a little twisting if you leave your seat flat. Also, with the way the seat extends/lies down into the pod, you can pick up some 'smells' from the person behind you. Unfortunately my last flight the person behind me had an upset tummy and made my sleeping experience less than desirable as it was easily smelled. 

Overall, GREAT configuration, and MUCH better than the recent BA World Traveller I sat in and paid more $$ for."
15121,"We flew SYD-LAX and thought the seats were good.  Plenty of leg room and I thought the seat width was good.  One important thing to know is that if you are planning to sit across the aisle from your travel partner, the row numbers don't match up; 16 A-C are actually across from row 17, 17 from 18 and 18 from 19.  The seating picture is inaccurate as the row 16 middle seats are in front of the row 16 side seats and 19 matches up with 18.  I didn't notice any people cutting in front of the row 16 pax during the flight and only 2 people before the flight took off."
15122,"In the private little 2-row business cabin, this seat is very secluded. As other wrote, the air vents above are loud and it's very close to the galley.  During meal prep it was quite loud, with lots of slamming doors and cabinets.  But it was serenely quiet at other times and no one walked by.  At 6'1"", I had plenty of room to stretch out.  Only downside is that JFK-LHR is such a short flight there's little time for sleep.  Meal service was quick, though, so 90 mins in and I was snoozing."
15123,Being 6ft3/1.90m I found these seat to be cramped. I am not overweight and fit exactly in these seats. I could only just fit one finger between my knees and the seat in front of me. The passenger next to me had a big bum which meant it overlapped my seat. The lack of space means you can't stretch your legs under the seat in front of you because you can't make the angle. Aisle seat doesn't help either the armrest are low and protruding into you upper leg. It is not possible to get your legs under the armrest. Aisle armrests are fixed and therefore a barrier preventing passengers putting their legs in the aisle. Aisles are narrow and cabin crew constantly bump into passengers and chairs. Main cabin extra gives you the minimum needed for comfortable travel on international flights. Poor experience with AA. In fact not recommended and never again.
15124,"3J is a fabulous seat!  Very quiet since it is in with FC.  Large bathroom behind it.  Seats comfy, IFE worked flawlessly.  Food was great - filet wonderful considering it was a plane.  Lots of storage."
15125,I liked the seat. Plenty of leg room and reclined nicely. All the seats in this section are relatively close to the bathrooms but that doesn't bother me.
15126,"Be aware that the oxygen tanks are in the overhead bin above this seat, so limited luggage space available."
15127,"Travelled LHR-DFW and DFW-LHR in 16A.  Although the comments regarding cold door and the door encroaching on the seat are accurate, the secluded nature of the seat and the huge amount of leg room (allowing you to stand up and stretch your legs in your own area is a great bonus.  Table is small, but happily used my 13"" MBP without any issues, I'm a large guy and didn't find the seat width an issue.  The cubby where the window is, is a brilliant idea and I was happy to forgo a window for this.  I enjoyed this seat so much I rebooked it on my return.  Managed to sleep the whole flight home, so that says something.  Something to note about 16D 16E 16H is that I noticed cabin crew regularly using it to cross between alises - this is because there is no galley at this bulkhead.  I'd have complained if I were sat in those seats."
15128,"For long hauls and even cross-continent, this is a great seat.  It is not an enclosed suite, but very close.  Plenty of storage around the seating area, multiple functions for the seat, and three windows, well 2.5.  The seat/bed is not as comfortable as some others I have used on other airlines, but it is roomy enough for my 6'7"" frame.  Sleeping was a breeze.  No noise from anywhere else, and honestly 1A and the front looked and sounded fine to me."
15129,"I flew from Dallas to London and paid a little bit more to sit in 33C. It was great for the legroom but that is it. The walkway narrows at this point and everyone bumped in to me, including the flight attendants. This seat should be extra money since it is such a hassle. The toilets weren't too close so there weren't many people lingering in front of me."
15130,"33C and 33J are the seat from hell. Although you have legroom with no seat in front, the seat ""sticks out"" in the aisle so you will be bumped by carts, flight attendants and passengers for the entire flight."
15131,"33j does have the tray on the left (aisle) side. Seats 33k and 33l are normal seats. We had 33j and 33l with 33k open, so was able to put up the arm rests and lay down. 33j is a cheaper alternative to Main Cabin Extra on American Airlines."
15132,"Standard econmony seat--two observations:
1. The internal seating overhead bins are too short for carry on bags to fit in wheels down--and i have the small international  size, i had to put it in sideways which greatly reduces capacity.  Bins over the outer seating were standard depth and abke to accomodate wheels down. 
2. On the seats with 4--the support bars under the seat are misaligned. I was on the aisle, with a metal bar 1/3 of the way from the aisle. There was not room to stretch out my leg under the seat  without encroaching on the aisle. Even more odd, was the shared bar bewteen the seats, so if someone had been in my left, their right leg and my left leg would have shared the floor space.  You're close enough on a plane without playing footsies. Luckily the seat was unoccopied."
15133,"I had a SWU come thru at the last possible second and had this seat LHR-LAX. It was very very private (when your seat is reclined, you don't see anyone at all) and the lie-flat seat + lightweight duvet was heaven. I actually slept for about 2 hours. The proximity to the lavatory is, in fact, annoying -- you hear it every time it flushes. But, the entry to that lavatory is, technically, on the Biz side of the curtain, so it wasn't used that often. There was room for bag storage on top of the seat and since it abutted the lavatory, I didn't worry about my bag falling down in flight. Other than the occasional toilet flush, this seat is very quiet and secluded."
15134,"No window, plenty legroom, so much that folk come and do their stretches right in front of you for que for the toilet.  TV and tray in armrest so a bit awkward, lack of storage due to proximity of exit."
15135,"I actually really liked this seat for my flight to LHR from DFW. Though the seat is slightly thinner and has the fixed armrest and swing-up TV, the leg room was excellent and lack of having someone reclining their seat into your space was a real plus. I had 19D on the flight back and that is also a great seat, but I would have no issue chosing 20C again."
15136,"I fly quite a bit and have flown this plane several times.  I'm only 5'9"" and when I recline me knees are pressed against the seat in front of me.  Can hardly move. One of the worst seating arrangements I have flown.  Not acceptable, especially for long flights."
15137,The seat is very comfortable and fairly roomy.  There is less privacy than one would expect from a first class seat but it really wasn't bothersome.  Flight attendant noise was more troublesome and it seemed as though they slammed every cabinet door shut the entire flight.
15138,No overhead storage. Bin above is filled with oxygen tanks.
15139,Confirming the prior comments about overhead storage containing oxygen tanks and being unusable for luggage. This seat should have an alert.
15140,Great seat but is missing 1 window so it only has 1 as opposed to 4J which has 2 windows.
15141,"I agree with a previous comment on the AA economy service from DFW-LHR it is without a doubt the most uncomfortable seating I have ever experienced and I fly a lot!

AA should not only be embarrassed but also fined for making passengers endure such seating.

The seats are extremely narrow, to the point where all three of us seating in the section by the window had to sit the whole journey with our arms folded, squashed up like sardines.

I am 5'11"" and my legs were in constant pain from being wedged up against the seat in front.

Another problem with this AA aircraft configuration is the very small overhead luggage bins. TOO small, or enforce the carry on size and number of bag limit; just an awful experience.

We will NOT be using this airplane or airline again. Shame as I am a platinum executive with AA by will not suffer seating like that ever again!

Find another airline!!"
15142,"Do not choose this seat if you like window seats. I paid $75 for this and it's 9"" from the window which means only a giant and lean on the window or side of the plane.  Miserable. Pick a row of 3 instead. Those are just a couple inches from the window and you can lean and sleep."
15143,"NIGHTMARE! A flight from Dallas to London/Heathrow of 8 hours and 55 minutes was 8 hours and 50 minutes TOO LONG! Shame on AA for expecting passengers to siit in seats that are too narrow, with awful, limited legroom, and narrow arm rests fhat allow no space between passengers. I was uncomfortable at only 5'2"", average weight so imagine my husband...he is 6'4"". BRUTAL SEATING! We have been forced to purchase extra cost seating for our return trip or suffer the aches and pains again. These aircraft seats are meant for children....little children!"
15144,"LAX-HKG. I agree with other comments on 2A that this is a nice commodious space (love being able to turn the chair 90 degrees to a work desk!) and (with the recent cuisine upgrade across AA) the food was nicely prepared. For example, pasta was actually nearly as well done as in a good restaurant and innovative. Compared to BA and Virgin Atlantic, AA still needs to ""get it"" about privacy (can't they install a curtain or something?); and it's not a dramatic step-up from their excellent B-class product (especially in the minicabin). B on this plane seems identical to F on their US transcon. Also I spent a lot of time researching the selection (thank you SeatGuru readers!)- not sure I'd want anything in Row 1 (light, FA conversations). Service was very very good."
15145,Only 1 window at seat. But very private. Recommended for those who dont care to look outside
15146,"I am normally loathe to fly AA, but due to my travel to Sao Paulo, Brazil I had no other option.  Traveling solo and paying a full fare Economy ticket, I changed my seat to 18D from JFK - GRU and on return.  I made an excellent choice.  Extremely comfortable, lots of legroom (I'm 5'7"" - but whatever), excellent in-flight entertainment options with easy access to the lavatory ahead of Row 16.  BTW, the port/starboard lavatories are for Business Class, but the middle lavatories are Extra Main Cabin.  I was fortunate to have a nice young lady in the middle seat who bundled up and slept the entire flight to GRU.  On my way back from GRU to JFK, a delightful older Brazilian couple sat in 18E and 18H.  Just as good as Business Class.  I'd fly AA again and sit in 18D."
15147,"This was my first flight on AA's 777-300ER in Business Class (ORD-LHR). We were seated in seats 3D and 3G). Most comments on this Aircraft were positive and I agree that this is the perfect configuration for the solo business traveler. However, I travel constantly with my wife and this is the first time in 30+ years of travel that we've been unable to communicate while seated together. We were separated by a seat divider which allowed conversation only by sitting on the edge of our seats and leaning way forward. This is NOT the airplane for newlyweds or people in love. Comfort, service and food were above average."
15148,Light from the galley is only a small part of the problem with this seat.  The real issue is the noise from the flight attendants as they work their service or chat among themselves.  There is also a closet close to the seat that they seem to open and close constantly.  For me the constant movement is also a visual distraction as you try to watch TV.  There is always some movement in the corner of your view
15149,Comfortable seat but definitely had the light shining in my eyes. Booked 13A on the way back.
15150,Nice seat. Flew ORD to LHR. No issues with lights coming from the galley. Lots of room. Had trouble with the seat not fully reclining. Would book this seat again.
15151,Nice seat. Flew ORD to LHR. No issues with lights coming from the galley. Lots of room. Would book this seat again.
15152,"31J is especially nice for legroom.  Im 6'5"" and will sacrifice almost anything for leg room.  Try table is so small it's almost useless.  Prox to toilet is annoyance. My wife was in 31L which has the emergency door housing that protudes a bit into your space.  Seats are narrower than the old 777-200 2-5-2 config.  I will always try to get these seats in future."
15153,"Not as bad a some comments make out.  I was worried the toilets are too close, but there is a screen pulled diagonally between them limiting access to one only from the rear, all the other toilets  behind mean that this is only lightly used.  The benefit of the endless legroom outweighs any problems.

16DEH seemed to enjoy it less, they are much closer then the picture makes out and don't allow full stretch, and get people crossing a lot.  A/L isn't really as limited as people imply, and the passenger from J moved themselves to L to sleep.

LHR-LAX."
15154,"Flew as a couple (JFK - LHR) and always happy to pay a bit extra for two on their own if MCE not an option however there were a few issues:
43A felt cramped as fuselage tapers in, I'm assuming it was a normal width economy seat but felt narrower. 43C was fine. Toilet proximity wasn't an issue.
Screen, although good, does not tilt, an issue when person in front reclines. In-ear style freebie earphones are worse than traditional over-ear offerings.
IFE selection did not change from August to September, nor did the website accurately reflect the selection (still said July)."
15155,"Chose this seat due to what appeared to be extra elbow room as the block accross the aisle goes from 3 to 2 accross. Really glad I did, the room in front seems quite restricted so it looked possible to be bothered by passing passengers and trolleys. Leg room fine, IFE good, food awful. However what really spoiled this flight for me was a huge cold breeze that persisted throughout. Staff appeared uninterested/unable to do anything and disappeared. I sat in my coat for nearly the whole time and was still cold the next day. Really uncomfortable experience and overall would not fly AA again from choice"
15156,"Seats are good, especially space for feet.
The console between your seat and the wall/window is really close to your entire left side.  Seat cushion not very comfortable after a few hours.  Food was OK, service was good. A lot better than old 767s and cramped 777 2s."
15157,"Sometimes, flight attendant or customer pass in front of the seat (between seat and bulkhead wall), which may be bothersome."
15158,"I flew HKG to DFW and I was worried this seat would catch alot of noise and light from the lav, but honestly once I leaned back it was not bad at all. The size of the business suite is nice, and you definitely have your privacy. I was surprised that I had enough room to lay completely flat. I am above average in size at 6 ft 4 and 290 lbs. The overall service was great."
15159,A very tight uncomfortable coach seat.  I felt like a sardine despite being on the aisle.  I don't know how the window seat occupants did it on this MIA-LHR flight.  Would prefer any other airline that doesn't offer 10 across seating
15160,"Flew from LHR-MIA.  Excellent leg room and a small private overhead bin is above this seat.  The back doesn't protrude into the aisle, as 18C does so you're not going to be bumped by the food cart. There is also storage space under your seat due to the bulkhead right behind you.  Toilet at the front of the cabin is not used as frequently by coach passengers.  Two caveats:  There is an AC vent above you and I was very cold despite a jacket and blanket.  A baby bassinette was attached to the bulkhead in coach--luckily I 
had the worlds quietest baby on my flight.  Because of the air vent I would probably pick row 17 or 18 D/F"
15161,DFW to HKG. You have no overhead storage because of Oxygen Bottles that fill the entire overhead compartment. Seat 13A is the same. This is true for AA138 from HKG to DFW also.
15162,Seat 7A (and to some extent Seat 6A) have no overhead bin space due to the oxygent mask storage overhead.  The advising should notify this was a yellow seat for caution.
15163,"This seat offered isle access with no one behind you. It has full recline. At 5'-10"" I found it provided plenty of leg room even when seat in front was reclined. Center arm also lifts. Had no trouble with the angle of the media screen. It lacks the foot reset of premium economy class seating but it was surprisingly comfortable for a 9 hour flight. Definitely worth the additional cost."
15164,Given that the light in the galley of the 777 stays on during the flight it can be bothersome to sleep.
15165,"Great seat, 2 windows, close to the exit but quiet enough as 1 removed from the galley. New business class is much better than BA, screens are large, great selection of movies, etc, USB and power ports close by, lots of spaces to store stuff, and noise cancelling headphones included if you don't want to carry your own. I would recommend this over BA as long as you are able to travel both ways on the 777-300 version."
15166,Very comfortable Main Cabin Extra seat.  Very good recline.
15167,"Months before booking this business class seat I was on SeatGuru checking comments.  I switched my seat back and forth a few times based on conflicting comments between being in the ""mini cabin"" (where 3J is located) and the main business cabin.  On both my flights LAX-LHR-LAX I chose 3J and I'm glad I did.  Quiet and private.  You have only one window (no problem for me) and yes, there is a loud fan noise(also didn't bother me).  I liked the seclusion from the larger business class cabin.  Loved the push button seat movement, you could lie flat, sit up, and just about everything in between.  Service okay, food okay, but for me, space and comfort is the key on a 10+ hour flight, and American delivered on that.  Oh and a nice feature; dozens and dozens of movies to choose from and snacks set up for you between meal services.  As others have said, the lavatory behind this row of seats is close, roomy, nicely designed."
15168,"18J in Main Cabin Extra was a very good seat as far as Economy class seats go, and any aisle seat in Main Cabin Extra appears to be good. 

Not cramped, easy access to restroom, one of the first people fed, dark, reclines, good room for feet. 

I flew this from LAX to SYD and was able to get a good enough night's sleep and operate the next day."
15169,"This seat was very comfortable.  I did not find the proximity to the rest room to be an issue as others stated, in fact it seemed very convenient."
15170,"On paper the seat looks great with lots of leg room BUT STAY AWAY. Lots of leg room but the seat is narrow and everybody will step on your feet, crew will hit you with their cart, etc, etc. Bad seat."
15171,"We sat in 3d and g from lax to syd.  the seats fully recline in your own little cubicle.  Didn't see a big difference between business and first. this little section is very private, plenty of room for storing personal items.  A little noisy as close to the galley , so on the way back we chose business seats further back.  All the same cubicles just more people around you. Slept well on both flights, so we were not exhausted upon arrival."
15172,Row 4 is coded yellow but i did not find it to be any issue.   Angle toward window and privacy makes gallery a non factor
15173,"I love this row in MCE because there's no one behind you so nobody is messing with their AVOD screen. It is closer to the bassinets which could potentially be an issue but babies on planes are a *fact of life* and not worth getting upset over :)

MCE on this plane is the best, all the other AA planes pale in comparison to this."
15174,"Constantly getting bumped by flight attendants during meal/beverage service as well as passengers walking through during the flight.  While the legroom is good, it is more than offset by the bumping."
15175,"Comfortable seat with option to lean back. I flew LHR - MIA but I have to agree that sometimes someone bumps into the seat (either passengers passing the seat or flight attendants with their drinks cards). Illumination and on boad entertainment was great! Leg space was extraordinarily big. Nice flight, thanks to the AA crew!"
15176,"In business class, my husband and I sat in the two middle seats, thinking it would be nice to face each other.  It was fine, but we actually preferred the return flight where we both had window seats. It was nicer to be able to share the isle.  We could get up and chat with each other whenever."
15177,"Seat 11A from SYD to LAX. This seat is definitely missing a window, which was okay for me as much of the flight was during daylight, but it did leave the area feeling a bit more cramped.  Otherwise, a wonderful business class product."
15178,Seats 6A and 7A do not have access to an overhead storage compartment. This is inconvenient. The compartment contains oxygen bottles permanently.
15179,"Both seats are perfect. I usually travel alone for business visits. I really feel comfortable in that cabin and I love these small suites. perfect privacy and real comfort from the cabin and the crew.
Thanks to AA cabin staff :-)"
15180,"I flew 2G LAX-SYD and 1D SYD-LAX, and I highly recommend 2G over 1D. As others have said, no overhead space at 1D. Also, so much light comes in due to the seat location close to the galley and the pilots bunks. Lots and lots going on at all times, which makes it very hard to rest. The first class service is excellent, and the amount of space in the cabin is incredible. However the light pollution makes it very hard to sleep in the first row. Would be great if AA could add curtains to block out noise/light."
15181,American finally got it right on this plane's business class seats. Private but with the ability of closing the doors on the small cupboards between the seats if you are flying with a companion. Lie flat beds are great improvement on the angle flats on the 777. Nice lighting. TV screens are big and entertainment system worked well. Pajamas in business class were very appreciated. Food from LAX to SYD just ok but SYD to LAX much better. Flight attendants did a very professional job both ways.
15182,"We were in BusinessClass Row, the 2 middle seat pods.   We thought this was an exceptional Business Class ride.  The seats reclined in many positions, the electronics were easy to use and worked exceptionally well.  The food was pretty good although we've had better on other flights.  The beds go flat and are private - the seat/bed is a little hard - not too cushiony.  We would definitely fly this plane again.  I peeked back into economy and those seats actually looked pretty good.  Service was exceptionally nice."
15183,"Very anxious for American's international premium economy rollout. In the meantime, this MCE cabin is not too bad. Incredibly thankful they kept air vents, when so many others are getting rid of them. Also, had no problem with the screen with seat in front reclined."
15184,"My flight is DFW to HKG. The seat width is 17"" only even an Asian feel tight for long  haul flight. Moreover, the seats are  almost full. A man is seating at the middle as well ....
The meals and entertainment are quite well. The Asian FA are working much harder than American FA."
15185,"Flew LAX to SYD recently and the business class product on this 777-300 ER was, in my opinion, excellent.  The minor issues about the seat not being as wide as it could have been or being a bit firm were far outweighed by the way the seat is positioned and all the appropriate technology and amenities.  The large screen IFE system performed flawlessly (although I did start off by trying to connect the supplied Bose headsets into a three port Audio Visual plugin which is visible on the side of the seat rather than the correct three-port headphone jack which is hidden in the small cupboard where the headphones and complimentary water are stored! - I wish they wouldn't use these proprietary plugs but the supplied headphones are excellent quality).  The flight attendant service was professional and courteous throughout.  The bathroom on the starboard side of the business class section (just ahead of seat 5J) is larger than normal and better appointed than a coach restroom.  I will seek to fly this airline/aircraft combination again as it was a great experience..."
15186,"a great seat, very quiet site immediately behind First , and immense leg room. My partner in 3G shares my view - plus an attentive crew and a sound menu on MIA - LHR. Much to be recommended and will be chosen again whenever I can on this 777-300."
15187,"Flew first class seat 1A on flight from Sydney to Los Angeles. Wonderful seat with 3 windows, privacy (no one in front of you) and lots of legroom. Compared to the same plane's business class product, it's roomier with more options for your legs and feet. Also feels a lot more spacious with generous ""desk"" space for your laptop, drinks, phone, etc. Seat controls worked well and were fast/responsive. Massage function was lackluster. A little light from the galley leaked into this seat area. Note the first class bathroom on the same side as 1A was bigger than the bathroom on the 1J side (on business it's the opposite). Great seat."
15188,"On past flights I've sat in 16A, 17D and this time in 19D and have to say that 19D was the best by far.  The partition behind row 19 means no one will bump your seat, you can recline without hesitation and can store things under your own seat.  There's also a mini bin directly overhead which I had to myself.  Great recline too.  Being in the center section means the middle seat can exit either way, so my sleep wasn't disturbed.  Menus and hot towels to freshen up were distributed to the main cabin - a nice touch.  Food wasn't terrible.  As another reviewer mentioned, there definitely is some vent blowing cold air over this seat."
15189,"Have flown LH, OS, BA, UA and VS business class, and AA's seats on the 773 exceed all of them in terms of privacy, space and comfort.  Service was perfectly adequate - not overwhelmingly friendly but efficient.  Food was also quite good.  PJs, slippers and a seat cover made for a good night's sleep on the 15-hr flight from LAX to SYD.  IFE was OK - enough to entertain."
15190,"Flew a redeye from LAX to LHR in seat 32L. Upgraded to these seats so we wouldnt have to deal with a 3rd person in our row. Location is close to lav, but never had a line form near us. Theres a passageway across from the exit row so you have a place to stand and stretch out of the aisle. On flight home we upgraded to MCE and those seats were much more comfy. The add'l leg room in MCE makes a huge difference. We were in 18J and L on the flight from LHR to LAX and felt much less cramped."
15191,These seats are worth the additional $157. Upon kiosk check in i was offered upgrade to business for $500. Wish i hadn't already purchased the MEC. However I will say the MEC seats on this aircraft are very worth the price due to space. Coach is pretty tight for a 6' person. MEC has PLENTY of space and the 3-3-3 makes for more comfort.
15192,"DFW-HKG-DFW. First in 1D, then 1J. 1D is a seat you should avoid at all costs. It is both close to the galley and right behind the door the captains (we had an extra 2, so 6 in total, it was nonstop movement) use to get up to their bunks. The galley in First tends to be super busy during the flight as FA's like to congregate up there and they don't care to be quiet. Also, the lights are super bright from the galley and there is no curtain to separate you from the galley. 1J much better on way back. Bottom line - FLY BUSINESS NOT FIRST. If you can snag row 3, either window, even row 4, you're much better than FIRST. The food is the same - the only difference is you get some PJ's, have a little more room but less privacy surprisingly. The micro cabin in Business rows 3-4 are far superior."
15193,"Sat in 3J LHR-LAX.  Highly recommended. The forward business class mini-cabin feels very private.  Much more so than ~11-row main business cabin behind the galley where I sat eastbound. With the two opposite aisle seats empty I had only the FAs walking by. Plus it's a short stroll to the large business restroom that I mistakenky didnt use going over. The seat, entertainment, and service were excellent as others have mentioned."
15194,"Please do not take this seat. As stated in previous reviews, this seat hasn't got rest position, but also has less legroom than 40A because they are aligned obliquely to the row 39, because of the conical shape of the plane in the back. This issue also applies to the seat 40J. I was at 40A and have much more legroom than regular coach seats precisely for that reason."
15195,Business class seats on this plane are great. I always travel business class and I can tell these seats are really good.
15196,First class 1G has absolutely no overhead Storage assigned.  Directly overhead is a fixed panel with no storage. And a small bin exists over the window seat but has equipment in it. Believe it or not overhead is rather limited in F/C because there are only a few seats. This seat was not thought out and is the worst F/C seat on this plane.  I would chose B/C over this seat.  Also note the front row don't allow you to have your personal items under the seat rest (weird thing with these planes) so again more stowage issues.
15197,"I am in flight right now and have a great seat. I'm AA Platinum, upgraded to MCE when I booked, but no aisles available, so I booked 18L.  I don't like windows because I like to get up a lot, especially on a long flight. Just before the flight boarded, someone in 17H got upgraded to business and I grabbed it.  I'm so glad I did, because the comments on SeatGuru made me think I had a great seat:  ""You can lean back with no one to bother, due to the bulkhead behind you"".  But as I look back at 18L, I'm  so glad I moved.  I would have been very cramped and the bulkhead actually seems to butt up against the back of the seat, so I don't know if it even reclines all the way.  17C, 17D, 17H, 17J, 18D and 18H are the best 6 aisle seats in MCE by far.  The seats recline almost flat and the seat in front of you doesn't cramp you when it reclines.  Row 19 middle has the bulkhead behind it just like the row 18 windows.  Row 16 has the extra legroom but narrower due to armrest trays.  I think I got one of the best six seats in MCE....  Good luck!"
15198,Excellent FC product.  Think 2A would be the better seat for less noise/light from galley.  Excellent entertainment and very good food and wine.  2 bathrooms for 8 passengers good also.
15199,"Over this seat is a very loud ventilation system, going on all during the flight. With the headphones on, it is completely fine. Without the headphones, it is headache-inducing. Otherwise the seat is nice, has 3 windows (but no view from 1) and the mini-cabin feeling is nice."
15200,"Flew AA100 JFK to LHR on JAN 6th.Loved this new AA aircraft.Very wide Business Class seat, huge amount of personal storage space, legroom incredible. I couldn't reach the end of the bed and I am 6 ft tall.This forward cabin of just two rows gives a much quieter ambiance.Galley and lavatories are behind you, but never heard any noise from them.
Some people may prefer the larger second cabin as more visual space around you. Bose head-set, Fantastic movie selection, large tv screen, lots of very good food.Stand up self-service bar for mid-flight gourmet food snacks. Excellent cabin crew.This Business Class product is far better than British Airways First Class seat."
15201,"28J flight from LHR to JFK, it takes almost 8 houres.
I am 6ft 5. There is not much room for jour legs, espcially not when the front chair is reclined. The AVOD are very good, it gives you the possibilities to listrn music, watch a lot of films or play a game. The stewards of AA are kindly and the food during the flihgt are ok.
Overall a good flight."
15202,"Very comfortable seat..flight crew was excellent...food very good...entertainment good, altho they could improve the movies and get some that are more current...well worth the money or the upgrade.."
15203,"I have flown in 4J to/from HKG and LHR, and find it very private and not disturbed by any noise. The lavatory is right behind the mini-cabin, rows 3-4 and close to the set-up between meals if you feel peckish. Always comfortable as a seat and bed and plenty of space to store items near the windows, or the area below, plus a full, overhead bin above the seat. I would choose this seat consistently, even having experienced the larger/main Business Class cabin in 6J, 12D,G, 8A.  No idea why anyone would choose First on the 77W when Business is a better, more private product."
15204,"I have flown the LAX-LHR-LAX route 4 times this year, and usually have been relatively satisfied. But yesterday was a pretty full flight, I'm 6-2, sitting in 24D, and person in front of me reclined immediately after takeoff, so it was an awful 10.5 hrs. Absolutely no room to move or eat, and my TV screen was hard to see at recline angle. I'll refuse to fly economy again on a crowded flight like this again."
15205,"First class on this plane, while not great by international standards, is pretty good. The seat itself, while not extremely private, is very comfortable and the IFE is very impressive. Overall, good new plane for American."
15206,"The best biz seat across the Atlantic. Very similar to the US Air legacy airbus 330 biz. Large, comfortable, and offering plenty or privacy due to the angling away from the aisle toward the window. A HUGE improvement over the unreconfigured 777-200, so make sure to check the type of plane prior to booking you biz ticket."
15207,Note that the overhead compartments for 13A and 13J on the 77W house the supplmental oxygen containers and therefore cannot be used to store luggage (every other business class seat gets its own overhead locker)
15208,"From Sao Paolo to Miami, the 31A seat it's a exit row seat. Was excellent with extra legroom and only two seats together. Therefore it's a good seat for long trips. The only thing is a missing windows, but usually are nights flights."
15209,"31J. Given the lack of space at the rear, lots of people use this area to mill around and chat (FAs aren't in the area). Was stepped on a few times and given looks as I actually used the extra space I paid for to stretch out, rather than permit them stand 6 ft from me and talk. Given the traffic and ongoing talk show, light sleepers should not sit here. Positives- you can stand up, stretch out almost whenever and easily use the restroom. If I had to take the row again, I would choose A/L, extra room by the wall (and the middle arm rest if hog it like my seatmate). The exit door only slightly impacts leg room and you can easily get up, and less impacted by people going in and out of galley. Guessing it's only solid-yellow per no window."
15210,I like 5J because there is space under the footrest that can be used to store things. Don't care about windows.
15211,"2J and 2A have an annoying blue light coming from behind you that you can't turn off. The control for the in flight entertainment is also backwards in the J seats, making it awkward to use."
15212,Finally American got something right.  The business class seats are better than or equal to a lot of First Class seats of most european carriers.  These seats are what would considered as suites.  The lie flat seats are comfortable. and would be even better that if they had pads.  The suites are very roomy and seem to have all the modern conveniences to make your flight enjoyable.
15213,"First, despite its bulkhead position, there's not any extra legroom for 16D/E/H, compared to other premium economy rows on this aircraft. Worse, flight crew and passengers used this row to pass through between the left and right aisles throughout the flight, asking to step over us. Add in the reduced overhead storage in the vicinity and these are pretty bad seats."
15214,"One of the least comfortable seats ever. If you are tall, do NOT book an economy seat. You will regret it... Never again."
15215,Flew LHR-MIA. Very modern plane and 18A a great seat for window lovers with 2 windows (over the wing) and same recline as other MCE seats. MCE section definitely worth the extra bucks!
15216,"So disappointed in Boeing's configuration for this aircraft. Could not speak with my travel partner for 8 hrs because it was difficult to see or hear them. I felt that I was in a closet and tripped over the seat to get in my cubby. Seats not comfortable, especially when lying flat. I will never travel on a 777 again! The 747 and other Airbus designs are more ergonometric and traveler friendly. For the $$-we lost out!"
15217,"I choose this seat as it was Main Cabin Extra and thought the leg room would be of a better standard. I am 6ft 5 and this was one of the most uncomfortable flights I have been on. The leg room is better that is a given, however the seat is smaller and the tray table is terrible."
15218,"This seat is a good seat except note that the overhead is completely consumed with Emergency Equipment O2, so you need to find other storage space around your seat."
15219,"16A has great leg room but the exit door extends partly into your leg area. Tray table is too small to use for anything other than a drink cup. Meal tray is bigger than tray table making eating difficult. Good seat only for sleeping. Magazine cubby is good for storing a couple small carryon handhellds such as kid canceling headphones, glasses, phone and water bottle. If you want to do anything but sleep for 11 hours pick another seat."
15220,The economy seats at 10 across are a bad joke for this 15.5 hour DFW-HGK flight. This set up is only suitable for trans continental flights. I will avoid ever flying on this configuration again.
15221,"This plane is quite luxurious, and both row 5 and 11 are missing 1 of 3 windows for this business class mini-suite, so honestly, one wouldn't notice a missing window."
15222,"I've flown in the main part of biz class and now the mini part of biz class and I much prefer the mini part (rows 3 & 4). there is very little foot traffic and even though the a/c is loud, the bose headphones work very well.  the only downside to 4A was that the FAs use the space behind it to load and unload trays, etc. so there is a lot of slamming of doors and I felt it in my seat.  not a huge deal on a day flight but I would avoid in on a red-eye."
15223,"I think 19-D/H are the best MCE aisle seats, unless you must have maximum legroom in which case 16-C/D/H/J may be worth it with the downsides that they have the swingup IFE arm that makes you look down & away at it which isn't the most comfortable.  19-D/H have a bulkhead behind, which means you can lean back guilt-free, and you can stretch your arms back around your seat etc. without interfering with anyone behind.  One caveat:  twice I've had this seat and it seems a special place for the generic ceiling outlets to blow cold air on until they decide to increase the cabin temperature above the usual initial freezing.  One additional note:  these IFE screens do NOT pivot, so when someone reclines in front of you with your screen attached, it's not the best angle.  A very dumb design flaw."
15224,"While better than any regular non-MCE seat, this is not a good seat unless you must have maximum legroom and 16-C/D/H/J aren't available.  All the usual comments about exit window being cold are true, and in addition to no window at all there is a plastic magazine holder where the window should be, making it even more uncomfortable.  The IFE screen also comes up on a separate arm, meaning you'll be looking down & away all the time, potentially uncomfortable on your neck.  Getting out of the seat is also more difficult because of the door and your entertainment arm unless you put it away each time.  And the bathroom light will spill over unless you're wearing eyeshades."
15225,"A near-perfect seat for my flight from DFW to LHR. A window seat with adequate leg room, two windows that are far back enough not to be subject to jet haze spoiling your view. International WiFi and an A/C outlet. The tray table did become an issue when the person in front reclined fully. I had been working on my laptop, which became difficult to do so after. The entertainment system is good, although the touchscreen suffers a considerable lag."
15226,"I recently flew from MIA to LHR on a night flight and it was a bad experience - the leg room is just not sufficient for someone above 1.80m (I am 1.92m and was not able to fit my legs without my knees pressing against the seat in front of me). And while the entertainment system is very responsive compared to older systems, the screen can't be tilted and the headphone plug is located under the screen and not in the arm wrest (which I find not ideal as I accidently unplugged the headphones at least 5 times). Overall, the experience was much less pleasent than on the US Airways (now also American) flight I took a few days earlier from LHR to CLT, which was a A330 with a slighty older entertainment system (still same movie selection) but with much more leg room."
15227,"All business class seats on this plane offer a good bit of room and privacy.  There were numerous entertainment choices.  The food was plentiful and petty good.  Lots of self-help snacks during most of the flight.  Contrary to what some others have said, I did not find this plane particularly noisy.  The flight attendants were friendly and helpful.  My wife (set 7A) had a very nice flight from LAX to LHR and hand nothing to complain about."
15228,"Sat in 5A as it was the only seat left. Avoid this seat for a few reasons - 1)The galley is definitely bothersome. You can hear everything and people tend to congregate there. 2) There IS a window in this seat, but only 1, not 2 like the other seats. 3) The wall in front of the seat (by your feet) is a solid wall all the way up to the ceiling, where the rest of the cabin is open above your head. May be a little 'closed in'"
15229,"Seats 3D and 3G. Privacy is the great thing about this aircraft. The front mini-cabin offers small booth-like compartments that provide a quiet and private flight. The seats (3D/3G) are separated by a divider and if you do not want to see the passenger next to you, the door housing the Bose noise cancelling headphones can be left open, effectively cutting off the view of the adjacent passenger. Great attendant service and excellent food and wine."
15230,"Seating in AA's 777-300ER economy from HKG to DFW's 16 hour flight was ridiculous.  AA managed to squeeze in one extra seat for each economy row, 3-4-3 hence 10 seats per row, comparing to JAL 777-300ER's 3-3-3, 9 seats per row in economy.  This is AA's American Way to appreciate economy customers!  AA even had to redesign the serving cart to make it narrower to push through the narrow aisle.  The cart looked so narrow that it could get tipped over very easy!  People who were walking through the aisle will bump into the shoulder of passengers who were seating on the aisle seats.  I can understand now why some people called these poor economy passengers on AA's 777-300ER looked like sardines!  AA's 777-300ER has 220 standard seats whereas JAL's 777-300ER has 156!  Now AA applied the same magic on its new 787-800 squeezing one extra seat in for each economy row, 3-3-3 hence 9 seats per row, comparing to JAL 787-800's 2-4-2, 8 seats per row in economy.  Shame on American Airlines!"
15231,"We flew this plane DFW to LHR, both ways. Best extra money spent ever!! It was our first overseas flight and I slept like a baby on the way over. The amount of space in main cabin extra is insane compared to economy. Although one word of advice, no matter how bad you have to use the toilet don't cross in front of seats 16DEH!! Both flights, different people, and I got yelled at for interrupting their ""paid space"". I wouldn't have done that had the line on my side of the aircraft not been 3 people deep and I was in serious need of the toilet. Also their little space is a good 3 feet wide, so I didn't think I'd be a huge disruption to their space, just a word of caution. Just grin and bear it, or plan your bathroom breaks better than I did. Otherwise main cabin extra really is the place to sit if you can!"
15232,"3J has plusses and minuses. Instead of having 2 windows it has 1. That is unfortunate for plane watchers. However, it is in a nice quiet cabin of only a few seats which is a bonus."
15233,"Overhead storage at seat 13A is not available due to oxygen tanks completely filling the space, must use adjoining overhead bins."
15234,"Just flew London-LAX in Main Cabin Extra on this 777 on May 16. Have flow over the Atlantic many times in coach and this was the best experience ever in terms of coach class seat comfort. I am 6'3"" and 260lbs. I stretched out fully with the added leg space and extra recline. Don't hesitate to pay the few extra dollars for this seat if your company won't pay for business class!"
15235,"I have flown this aircraft several times and find 2D&G in First to be quiet, roomy and better than most other AA 777 aircraft.  The two row design is far more comfortable with their older 777 with 12 first class seats.  Snag one of these when you have a chance.  This is a much nicer experience for the long haul traveler."
15236,"I flew DFW to HKG round trip in 19H and then 19D on the way back. I had 16C on the way back but after my flight to HKG in 19H, I liked this row and aisle seat that I requested it again on the flight back and was able to change to this seat. MCE Seat with plenty of legroom and nobody behind you so you can fully recline without feeling bad. Also being in the middle section, the person in the middle seat has two options of who to wake up to get out of the row. Infotainment had a great selection of movies as well. This 16 hour flight was more comfortable and enjoyable than my 3 hour flight from NYC - DFW."
15237,"These seats suffer from a terrible design flaw of the 777 aircraft.
The galley has chillers with fans that run at high RPM most of the time, increasing the noise level in this seemingly private cabin section tremendously. 
Sure, the brilliant noise cancelling headphones help to bring it down but I personally don't want to be wearing headphones for the duration of the full flight and therefore prefer rows 5 and up."
15238,"Flew GRU-MIA. Seat 3A is very quite and isolated. Located in the mini-business class cabin, right behind first class. Great seat, comfortable. Good food. Service was a little forced sometimes but flight attendants were attentive and responsive."
15239,"In 33J not only will you be bumped repeatedly by passengers and crew, so will your video screen and you'll have to reposition it every time. Very narrow seats; main cabin extra was much better on our return flight."
15240,"Flew LHR-LAX on March 4, 2015. Great airplane. Main Cabin Extra is reall worth the premium. I would not however pay the extra for a middle seat. Luckily the center seat was open on this flight and that made a huge diffence. I liked the fact that row 19 has a bulkhead behind it, allowing extra storage behind you."
15241,"DFW-HKG Good aircraft, great crew, food-meh. The seat was quite comfortable, even for a 17h+ flight. MCE really helps. The 777-300ER is a vast improvement over the 67. Thanks American"
15242,"Great comfortable business seat in a couple of rows between First and the Galley. The whole business cabin is basically the same layout, and is ideal for people travelling alone. As a couple, we were a long way apart, and the IFE box sits between us. So although i travelled with my wife, I hardly saw her between boarding and disembarkation. That said, 3d&g are very good seats."
15243,"The overhead bin on this flight for that seat was full of Oxygen tanks, thus rendering it completely useless.  Not bad if you don't have any bags to put overhead otherwise you have to look to share with others.  Since all overheads are labeled for individual seats you could find yourself in a bind"
15244,"The noise inside this aircraft carries quite far. For example,  from 2J I could hear every time the business class toilet door was opened and closed, which made for a rather restless night. I will remember next time to use the ear plugs they give out. Also, I am not a fan of the eye covers - just can't sleep with them - but the light from the galley was VERY ANNOYING! Crew was fantastic and the dinner was pretty good, not great. Overall, I must say that I will probably stick to business in the future, First Class was just not all that much better."
15245,"I have flown this aircraft for four times (AAL950/951) on rows 32 and 41. In general this is a good aircraft (it is a new aircraft) with enough legroom for a medium size person like me (5'7""), specially on those rows where you have two seats per row, which makes a couple travel more comfortable. One thing it distinguishes from others is the onboard international wifi, which makes the 10hrs flight goes by quite smoothly. Service is like any other american company, not the nicest and friendly staff ever, but they get the job done. Food is generally good, although TAM has a better selection."
15246,"Flew this aircraft from London-LHR to JFK.  The seat, the service, and every aspect of this mini-business class cabine were outstanding.  I was able to have a nice three hour nap after lunch and arrived refreshed in New York.
     The only drawback to this seat is that there is only one window.  Seat 4A has three windows.  Nonetheless, I would select this seat again without reservation"
15247,"While AA's 777-300 ER is overall an outstanding improvement to business class travel, the best part is the ""mini cabin"" of rows 3 and 4 between 1st and the rest of business is almost a private suite with a stocked pantry and 2 lavs."
15248,"Row 16 seems the best row in MCE.  BUT, I would opt for the lateral seats.  DEF seats had people climbing over during the flight to change aisles.  The leg room is good, but the latteral seats (ABC & JKL) have tons more leg room."
15249,"As a 5'11"" male who wears 38W x 30L pants I found this seat to be more than adequate for this 14 hr. flight.  The IFE was enough to keep me entertained and the legroom was sufficient. I plan to book this seat or one similar to it on future flights I have to Asia."
15250,"While you have unlimited legroom there are drawbacks to this row of seats. There is no place to store personal items in flight.  The armrest-stored tray table is ""wobbley"", is half the width of the seatback model and lacks enough surface area for even the meal tray.  Unless super-size legroom is your main concern, this would be the only reason I'd recommend this seat."
15251,This seat is too close to the galley and the crew seating area.  It is very noisy so impossible to get rest without using the BOSE noise cancelling headphones (which are excellent).  3G is a much better seat as you are in the quiet area with only 8 seats but farther away from the galley and it makes a HUGE difference!  The 77W is an awesome plane though!
15252,Seat 13A does not have overhead storage because the overhead storage bin for this seat houses the emergency oxygen bottles.
15253,"This seat is no better for the extra than an economy class seat on Cathay Pacific....if you must take american, this is the way to go....the people in main economy were like sardines in a can, without the oil....its disgraceful how the pitch is so tight...and the seat so narrow....the food is not that great either in either class....19 d would have been ideal if the man in 19e had not been sick and vomiting the entire 15 hrs...the plane was full and there was no where else to go....pay the extra on this long flight or book Cathay. 15 hrs is a long time..."
15254,"LHR > JFK November 2014. Fantastic seat: this area of Business class is away from the main lot so feels cosier. The seats are almost suites: The seats themselves are very good - quite wide; huge wardrobe; loads and loads of storage space. Food ok; ICE excellent; WiFi speed 3-7Mb and not expensive considering the technology. 
Very impressed. Bose noise-cancelling headphones.
AA Business is better than BA First Class (which I had for the return flight"
15255,"Overhead is a very loud ventilation system. You may find this noise unwelcome. Not only was it loud pre-flight, but it was surprisingly loud during the flight."
15256,"Economy comfort, or premium economy, whatever they call it on American is well worth the $65 for the 16-17 hour flight from DFW-HKG. I have taken it twice now and the leg room is more than adequate, slightly more recline in the seat, and a general feeling of more comfort. I haven't sat in the back yet but I walked around and made some seat notes for future flights, it looks quite cramped."
15257,"I have flown this aircraft multiple times over the past few months and it is wonderful.  First class is in my opinion far superior to other transatlantic carriers.  Great food, great staff, great seat for sleeping, and great entertainment."
15258,"This really is worth paying the extra for - it was about £82 each, and you have so much more legroom and space.  The screens are fantastic and you have a good range of movies music etc.  Food was ok, but on a nearly 8 hr flight from LHR to JFK they served within half an hour of takeoff and then 6 hours later shortly before landing so there was a big gap where we saw no stewardesses.  This cabin doesn't seem to have a staff member so bear that in mind.  Very comfortable seat and after flying home in standard BA we wish we had booked AA again."
15259,"Firstly I love the 700-300er. American's seating configuration is the best across the Atlantic, far better than the cramped BA ying-yang, face your neighbor layout. DFW-LHR I was in 7J. Great seat, with two windows. LHR-DFW I was in 11J. No window although I did have a partial view from the window in 10J. The service on board was very good both ways. The crews were great and the flight deck crew got us there and back safely and comfortable A+ for that. The food was plentiful, tasty with a good choice of dishes. The walk up kitchen was excellent and well stocked throughout the flights. All in all I would highly recommend AA over BA on this route. One note: rumor has it that AA will be using the 777-200 series on this route and fitting them with the ridiculous ying-yang seating. BIG mistake AA!!!! Don't do it!!"
15260,".Overhead storage was surprisingly small.  I have a small roller bag and it took up the whole overhead bin. It was a good location.  I was able to use my neck pillow and the airline pillow to get a bit comfortable and I am short, so I stuck my feet in the seatback pocket and was able to get a bit of sleep (with medicinal help).  The food is what one would expect from AA - BA is better.  if you have to fly international in coach - MCE is worth any extra money for an aisle or window seat.  Not so sure about a middle seat - because it is a middle seat."
15261,"This seat is great, you have about 8 feet in front of you to the bulkhead wall.  Sometimes people stand there to wait on the toilet, but not a bother as there is plenty of room"
15262,"I like this plane.  I am 6'4"". The legroom in the cheap seats was the best I've experienced in a long time. It was not spacious, but the seat in front of me never jammed into my legs, even when it was reclined (which it was for all but 30 minutes). Every control and plug has been moved into the seat back in front. There is not only a UK/Euro/US AC plug, but also a USB port.  The video display is large, and the movie choice is HUGE, including over 250 movies from almost SEVENTY years, right up to recent full feature releases.  I'm going to try to get all of my future trans-Atlantic flights on this plane."
15263,"I flew on this aircraft (new in the AA fleet), N728AN, from LON to MIA.  I was in Main Cabin Extra and was very impressed.  I hadn't flown with AA in quite some time, and if this is the direction AA is headed, I will definitely be flying again.  Large comfortable Economy seats, with very good entertainment system, and decent leg room.  Great for those who cannot afford business class, but need something a little ""Extra."""
15264,This seat has all the medical equipment (mainly 10 or so oxygen cylinders) in the overhead compartment.  Therefore there is no space to put your carry on or even small bag.  These need to be stowed either side or across the aisle.  Probably not a good thing on a very busy flight.
15265,"I flew from London to Los Angeles and must say that this was one of the most awful flight experiences i ever had. No space for legs. I felt like in a cheap charter flight. Sorry, but i won't fly American Airlines again!"
15266,"The only positive thing about this seat is not having another seat in front of you. However, your leg space is constantly challenged by anyone walking through the aisle as it is part of the regular path. You won't have a seat pocket and you can't keep your bag with you which means every time you need something, you need to deal with the stowage. This seat is NOT worth the premium."
15267,"I flew from DFW-HKG in MCE seat 17L after being moved from 19E.  Due to a weather we had to fly over Russia which made the total flight time just over 17hours.  I must say this seat was just fine for the long trip but I was also lucky not to have the middle seat taken.  It is clear to me that the best seats are on the aisle and I would NOT take a middle seat in this section if there are aisle in the back.  The extra leg room is great but the extra inch in seat width is not that noticeable. However, I did take a walk to those back seats and it did look cramped."
15268,"Flew DFW-LHR. Agree with other comments about the positive points of these seats. People - both pax and crew! - using the row as a corridor between the two aisles was only a problem during boarding.  Further negative point is that fold-out table is *very* small - smaller than my small laptop and impossible to have a drink on the table at the same time. Fairly cool part of aircraft (although not as cold as 16L) - I wore a fleece throughout the flight and my feet, in flight over-socks, were cold."
15269,"I flew for 16 hours from Hong Kong to Dallas/Ft. Worth. I thought I was going to be in misery being 6'2"", but to my surprise, this was the best money spent!! The seat in front of me NEVER came close to touching my knees! I could stretch out and relax on the long flight. I was able to recline all the way back and not hit the bulkhead behind me. The AVOD system was great to watch movies at an instant and not having to wait for them. The flight crew was great as well to ensure we were comfortable on the long flight."
15270,"Flew LHR to DFW on 27Sep14. The only MCE front-row seat I could get was 16E, in the middle of the bulkhead row.  There was plenty of leg-room (although I have short legs) and I could get out to the aisle without disturbing the sleeping passenger either side. I was wary given previous comments about other pax using this row as a corridor to cross to/from toilets.  During boarding there was some irritating traffic through the row, but no problem after take-off.  I found I preferred the middle part of row 16 rather than the side/exit rows - warmer and less draughty, and no sense of sleeping in a barn (as at 16C for instance).  As the notes say the tables are small and I managed to tip my drink of water over myself!"
15271,"Seat was fine... Plenty of leg room and emergency exit bulk did not really obsruct leg room much.  While it is close to the lavatory, the spacious area around the seat made this less bothersome."
15272,"Utterly cramped. We like to sit together and don't want anyone between us so we chose the 2 wide at the back. We flew from London to LAX and couldn't move. Thank goodness the people in front of us never reclined. For reference, my husband is 6' and had to sit with his legs spread for the whole flight. I'm 5'6"" and my knees were right up against the seat in front of me. When i got up to go to the restroom my legs were numb. I used to be able to slide by and over him to leave my seat. Not any more. Didn't think it was possible to reduce the room any further but AA found a way! Just sit back, close your eyes, grit your teeth, and bear the nightmare that this seating configuration has become IF you really need to fly."
15273,"Great Seat! At the back of MCE cabin and under two overhead bins (including a smaller one). Even in a full flight, I had room to put both carry ons above, leaving me with legroom to spare."
15274,AWFUL  No room to breath at all. You will need to hold your food tray as it will not come down fully without hitting you in the gut and on top of your knees.  Too long of a flight to be treated like cargo!
15275,Took BA A380 (club world)out from LAX to LHR and AA 77W back on code share in club world. Much more room and nicer amentities in the 77W compared with A380 which seemed cramped and you had to step over passengers who were sleeping fully reclined. I had expected the opposite to occur. Even the meal was better on the 77W. Hat tip to AA for this design and service. Would fly this plane anytime!
15276,A great seat! You have so much legroom and it feels like a private cabin since there are so few seats in it. Also nice that you have full recline and don't have to worry about the person behind you.
15277,"I recently flew from London to Dallas on this plane.  For those of you who don't have the option of flying first or business class, go for the main cabin extra.  The increase in price was minimal to economy and the amount of legroom was incredible.  There are no bad seats in this section.  Even though the first row of seats is near the lavatory, this was not an issue for the people seated there.  The extra legroom is worth the minor inconvenience with the bathrooms.This plane is beautiful and the touch screen media system is top notch."
15278,"I flew home from london to los angeles.  I heard  that the main cabin extra seats had extra leg room.  Well they do, BUT the center section of row 16 has constant traffic by other passengers trying to get to toilets.  I believe the last row would have been a much better choise."
15279,"I flew home LHR to LAX on this 77w plane.  The business class cabin and seat  is far superior to BA business.  I slept half the flight, never been able to sleep on plane on other international flights.  I felt like I was in first class."
15280,"This is the second time I have flown Flt. 136 LAX to London, and I chose to fly through LAX specifically to fly on this plane in Business.  It is the most comfortable, technology-accessible, and private Business Class seat to London.  Each passenger has a ""pod-like"" seat equipped with a large screen TV, headset (had to ask for an adapter because the plug on the aircraft has been changed to a UK  3-prong plug, and I was using my personal earphones), mirror, wide seat that makes a very comfortable bed, and more. Similar seat on return trip.  I really don't know why anyone would buy a first class seat when Business is so terrific on this plane."
15281,"Fantastic plane and great seats, by far the best product over the Atlantic and far superior to BA. 
Seats are very comfortable, extend fully 180 degrees, privacy enhanced by the pod like configuration. AVOD terrific, screens huge and HD, lot of nooks and drawers for personal items to store.
When I book BA flights to LHR I chose code share AA flights because of the business class seats!"
15282,"JFK to LHR flight in this seat was pretty much like the 777-200, the only difference is there is a bit more space between the seat and the wall which is nice, but the tray table is very small and low. It really is too small to accommodate the dinner tray and it does not move forward. Prefer 31a on 777-200."
15283,Flying from Hong Kong to Dallas with a 7 year old in MCE was wonderful.  There was so much more space and I slept briefly but I never sleep.  He- the 7 year old slept at least 8 hours.  Pay the money for the extra space it is so worth it!!!
15284,"The first class seat was very comfortable for both relaxation and sleeping.  The video screen is large and the selection of movies is the best of any U.S. airline.  It is on a par with oneworld partner BA, but not as nice as Asian carriers like CX."
15285,Biz class seats are fantastic. Your very own pod - you can't see anyone else. Seat is comfortable and the flat bed is too. Slept really well - I kept the Bose noise cancelling headset on while I slept and I'm sure that helped. Much better than BA
15286,"flew seat 3a mia to lhr and it was super comfy! I'm a woman 5'6 and felt like i was in my own bed. They give you amenity kits and turndown service only in FC & BC, which is excepted bc u pay more than double the price of economy. plane was very new and nice no noise for was excellent. but everyone in economy looked like packs of sardines from BC, so I'm sure its uncomfortable."
15287,"I flew on flight 50 on May 16th and it was a nightmare.  I'm 6'4"" and the 31 inch seat pitch leaves no room when the seat in front is not reclined.  The passenger in front of me tried to recline his seat painfully mashing my knees in the process.  Thankfully, the fellow in front of me was kind enough not to recline for almost all of the 8 hour flight.  One of my travel partners is a male that is normal build and 6 feet tall.  He found the seating ridiculously uncomfortable.  He is an older gentleman who wears reading glasses.  When the seat in from of him was reclined, the entertainment screen on the back of the seat was so close to his face that he could not clearly see the screen!  I fly American a lot (once to twice a week round trips) but I will not fly trans-Atlantic with them until something is done about the seating conditions in coach."
15288,"All the main cabin extra seats 17-19, except for the bulkhead seats are great, if you can't get B or F. I took this flight instead of going direct from Boston on BA, because the BA planes are old and uncomfortable. The entertainment system is so much better as well"
15289,"These are great seats for economy (premium) and there is no difference between rows 17,18, 19. The entertainment system is excellent as well. I choose to fly BOS-JFK-LHR rather than BOS LHR because I'm tired of the awful BA service out of Boston."
15290,"DFW-LHR MAY 11 2014
Very uncomfortable seat; leg room inadequate even for a 5'8"" person.  If seat in front reclines, it is almost impossible to use the tray.  
I fly AA frequently and prefer AA.  But I am very disappointed in how packed & uncomfortable  these seats are."
15291,"Great Product , if I have to fly oneworld to the US I prefer AA a million times to BA. Seats excellent  Wine Selection okay , food American meaty , what do you expect... Some fiddling with the Bose Headsets but who cares really you want to sleep and the full flats are excellent for that purpose"
15292,"I received an unexpected upgrade to this seat and was delighted with the lie-flat bed it turned into. However, I had a couple of minor niggles:
 The Bose headset looked as though it should plug in to the three-pin socket on the outside of the cabinet containing slippers and toliet bag.  After plugging it in the headset did not work, and then I discovered with the help of the attendant that it actually plugs in to the socket inside the cabinet which you locate by looking into the mirror on the cabinet door! Why AA came up with this design is a mystery to me.
 The cabinet door refused to close due to difficulties with the closing device. Jamming a folded-up piece of paper in between door and cabinet worked, but this is a small problem that should have been fixed since I was advised it was not uncommon.
Overall though these new BC seats are a big improvement on the old 777-200 BC seats, so kudos to AA for that."
15293,"I'm 6ft, 240 lbs. The seat was tight at the hips, my shoulder was out in the aisle because the seat is so narrow. The woman in front of me reclined as far back as she could. My tray table pressed into my stomach, the carts hit my arm every time, people could not walk down the aisle as it was too narrow, and when the woman to my right had to get out, she struggled desperately, as the armrests don't raise, and there just isn't enough space for even a small person to get out when the seat in front is reclined. Food was okay, stews were great, but never again on an AA 77W - it's a sardine can attached to the Business and First cabins where people pay 5 to 9 times more for a seat. I feel I was robbed of my $1800 for a round trip ($50 for the second bag each way, and $107 for a ""preferred seat"" on the way back that was no better at all."
15294,"I have never been so cramped on an international flight in my life.  There is no way to get comfortable in the seat due to lack of space.  The isles are so narrow, that the stewards could barely get the cart through.  When people walked in the isle, if they didn't turn sideways, they were bumping off the shoulders of the passengers.  I thought my left shoulder would be bruised by the time I got off the flight.  If you have a window seat, you better be a gymnast to get in and out of your seat if the person in front of you is reclined.  The fact that the armrests do not lift up just makes it that much worse.  Very disappointed with American and will try to avoid them on all future flights.  What a disappointment and lousy way to end an otherwise nice vacation."
15295,"I have flown seat 3A on the AA 77W on four trips to LHR.  I prefer seats 3A and 3J because they are in their own private two-row compartment just forward of the boarding door.   You are never disturbed during the flight by people using the Lav or walking by.   It is a very private, secluded seat."
15296,Very uncomfortable for tall people.beware of new planes with cramped seats. This one seat specially...
15297,"This seat in the Extra Main Cabin was definetely worth the extra $. Row 19 has bulkhead behind where you can place a few things - and it makes it a pretty quiet seat with noone behind you. Also, good leg space in front even with forward seat in recline."
15298,"LAX-LHR. The seat itself was comfortable, the IFE was good quality with a wide choice of movies and the Bose noise cancelling headphones worked well which was just as well because this has to be the noisiest plane I have ever flown on. The flight crew have to shout to chat and any PA announcements cannot be heard unless you are wearing the headphones. I heard the bathrooms being used 2 or 3 times during the flight so I don't think this is an issue for this seat."
15299,"Flew LHR to DFW in 18D.  At 6'2"", 225 lbs - I can fill an airline seat.  Despite that, I found this flight/seat to be very comfortable.  Has good pitch and seat width.  No seat sores to report even after a 9.5 hour flight.  This seat is right over the wing so no real view.  Would rather have had 19D or F for that reason only.  With bulkhead behind, pretty quiet seat and no issue leaning back.  Good leg space in front even with forward seat in recline.  IFE is fantastic with more content than you can possibly consume over multiple flights.  Have flown
business on this same plane on prior occasions.  While I certainly appreciate the luxuries of business class, this is not a bad option if its otherwise unavailable. If travelling on my dime, would rather sit here than spend the money or miles for a business upgrade.  Only complaint is the food.  I've had decent meals on AA before when flying first both domestically and internationally.  Not sure why coach has to be such a massive step down in eatability."
15300,"fantastic plane, no noise, great service, good food and the crew take cares of you. Good idea to have some snacks during the flight. This is the best I ever flight"
15301,"Great seat comfort, plenty of length. Mini Cabin feels cramped and claustrophobic compared to 772.
Only downside was picture quality of movies on new HD IFE screen. Tried my PVR using RCA's. Took a while as there is a tiny switch you have to toggle between RCA and Iphone connectors. Picture quality was terrible. Went back to using my laptop. AA need to upgrade to the USB Movie software player that is available for these units to gain maximum value. That way you can play your content for movies off a stick as you can now for pictures or music."
15302,"AA sells this seat for an extra charge, but actually I got it for free when doing my checkin. People will be bumping in your feed all the time, including flight attendants. Luckily for me, there was no one sitting in the K and L seats, so I was able to just seat on all three of them."
15303,"Great seat, you definately get the extra room feeling.  There is no one directly behind you, only a divider.  So you can actually place your jacket or other small items behind your seat."
15304,"Much more comfy than British Airways; wider and a lot more room for storage near seat; nobody having to step (and stumble) over your footrest to gain access to aisle.  Design provides much more privacy, especially in windows. Extras: pillow close to standard as opposed to mini-pillow on other airlines; nicer blanket."
15305,"Plus points - lots of leg room
Negative points - no window, there's 1 magazine rack for the row and its on your side, so passengers in 16J and 16K have to ask you for magazines which gets annoying.
Also, it gets cold being near the exit door."
15306,Very private excellent seat in mini business class cabin
15307,"AA has managed to squeeze an additional economy seat across its 773 fleet, and has reduced legroom, too.  It was like sitting in a E-145 from JFK to LHR.  Seating was so tight that most pax did not recline their seats for fear of bumping their neighbor's knees.  Lady sitting in front of my wife reclined fully.  Seat back was only inches from her face ( and she's fairly petite).   Although the new entertainment system is the best of any airline, it couldn't make up for the cramped economy seats.  Even the flight attendants were complaining of the aisle width when hauling carts through.  Premium economy is sized like Delta's standard trans-con economy.   Sorry AA.  We tried."
15308,"MCE is great space if you can get it. Some years I am Platinum and some Exec. Platinum.....so I have access to MCE always. Nice seat, good knee room and seat width and recline for a 6'0"" adult.  MCE is great if you can't get the upgrade...pity the fool who has to sit in the traditional 10-across Economy!"
15309,"DFW-GRU & back in MCE.  I preferred 18C to 16C.  18C did not have the person behind applying an annoying tap-tap-tap to their touchscreen, and it had very sufficient leg-room for my 5'10"" frame (though I do agree with the earlier comment regarding the raised lip at the front of the seat being somewhat uncomfortable - 18C was worse than 16C in this regard).  18C also features a bit more storage under the seat itself (good place to tuck the pillow/blanket or a laptop). The entertainment system is very good; I found the seatback system preferable to the one on the swing-up arm of 16C, mainly because of the viewing angle and access during take-off/landing (and 16Cs gets bumped by passersby).  However, the seatback versions screen does not tilt to improve the viewing angle when the person ahead of you leans his/her seat back.  I'll definitely do my best to stick with MCE on this airplane.  Im not eager to try the 10-wide Main Cabin. Overall, I think MCE is a notable improvement over even exit row seating in AAs 2-5-2 777-200s."
15310,"I flew LAX-LHR and was very satisfied with the service provided by the flight attendants for this seat.  I felt that in this instance, that the proximity to the galley was a positive benefit, as I received lots of personal attention.  Also, the nearness of the lavatory was not an issue at all. Lastly, because of the ""mini-cabin's"" isolation from the main J class section, you feel almost as if you are in F cabin."
15311,"Seat 18J in the Main Cabin Extra section was just fine.  I'm 6 feet tall.  There was plenty of legroom and a decent amount of recline.  There is a divider wall behind this seat, so I was able to stow things there after takeoff and that gave me more room."
15312,"If you're flying coach and don't want to pay the extra for an exit row, pick this seat. There is no seat behind you, so you can recline without any worry. Legroom is predictably tight for a 31"" pitch, but not terrible."
15313,very narrow seat in a new furbished cabin. Poor service but entertainment system is one of the best I'd ever seen in an economy class.
15314,"Congratulations to the premium flyers. American has continued its proud tradition of giving you a comfortable, restful trip at the expense of the 220 of us who are flying in the coach cabin. The aisle in the economy section is so narrow it is impossible for anyone to walk in it without disturbing the passengers with aisle seats. But that isn't really a problem because the seats are so narrow and the pitch so short that sleep is impossible as well. I'll never fly on an American Airlines aircraft again - this or any other! Their blatant disregard for the economy passenger in favor of the high value babies in premium class says all I need to know about their interest in my business.Even with the extra price charged in First, business and main cabin extra, the coach cabin still ensures the profit and therefore the viability of this flight."
15315,"The 32J is a nicer seat because aisle is wider next to it, but it is still a very narrow and small seat. American charged extra for this as a ""premium"" seat. The aisles on this new 777 are extremely narrow. Apparently, they added 100 new economy-class seats to this model. I always get up to walk and I found the aisles so narrow that I could not walk without hitting people. I could only really walk back and forth in the galley area next to the seat. The new entertainment system is very nice, but small compensation when my knees were solidly against the seat in front (I am 6'4""). No chance to use the power plug because of the lack of space. I will not fly on these 777 planes again unless I can at least get Main Cabin Extra (and there are very few of those seats)."
15316,"Travelers should be aware that the Business Class bulkhead window seats only have 1 window in the ""pod.""  The other window seats in Business class have 2 windows within the ""pod."""
15317,"If you travel with a companion pick the center seats in First Class because the privacy panel lowers and you can swing both seats toward each other and dine across a centered table.  Also perfect for card games or to work on business with a co worker. Wifi is available plus a huge selection of video and audio. After cocktails & dinner you can change into the PJ's provided and press the bed button and the seat combines with the second ""visitor"" seat in your unit to form a flat bed. The 8 to 10 hour flight seems very short if you are asleep!"
15318,"****WARNING******The new config in coach for American A/L 777's are a disaster for flyers over 6' tall.   You might want to rethink flying coach on 777 on American overseas if you are over 6' tall.  These new coach seats are the most uncomfortable seats flying on a US flagged air carrier today, as American Airlines added a 10th seat across in their 777's in coach and took another inch or two off the legroom wedging passengers in even more.  In addition, the curvature of the cabin takes more shoulder room off the window seats adding to neck strain as you have to tilt your shoulders to fit. With an international flight of 10+ hours you will be that much more miserable than normal.  Not only will I not fly again on these planes, these seats probably should be legislated against."
15319,Seat 12A= There are three windows at this seat with good views through 2 of them.  There is considerable engine noise at this seat at start up.  Great seat otherwise.
15320,"Although I agree that the angled configuration of the business class seats does put the one arm rest at an odd location and the space can feel a bit tight, the angled and enclosed configuration also gives this very tall, 6'4"" guy the space to bend my knees while sleeping -- without the risk of them being smacked by a cart in the aisle or bothering the person in the adjacent seat.  I've flown this plane in both MCE and business and will take either over the old 777-200's.  The seats are far more comfortable and the entertainment system is better.  My only complaint is in sympathy for the people in the regular main cabin -- AA should be ashamed for going 10 across with a 31"" seat pitch!"
15321,"The air/con is pretty loud on the ground, but fades away with the typical airflow in flight.  The Bose sound-canceling headsets do a good job of eliminating that noise though. Take note that the Bose headsets provided have a special 3-pin plug that only powers the noise-cancelling feature when its plugged into the aircraft receptacle, so they don't work in any of  your typical personal devices (laptop, iPad, etc).  I ended up using my own in-ear buds, and then putting the provided Bose around-the-ear headset on.  Worked great."
15322,"The available space in business class is marginally bigger for the window seats, due to an additional space between the seat and the window.  In the interior aisle seats this does not exist due to the fact this space is occupied by the adjacent seat. 
The new seat feels a ""little"" more claustrophobic, but is a small price to pay for a fully flat bed.  
That said I was very disappointed in the food on offer."
15323,"I agree with the comments regarding the business class ""mini-cabin"" of rows 3 and 4.  The overhead A/C unit is very loud, however, this is more noticeable on the ground.  Once airborne the noise tends to blend in with the outside air noise.  The location of the galley is also very disturbing, especially if on an overnight flight and you wish to sleep.  There is a lot of activity going on there, and it's hard to miss the noise even with earplugs or the Bose headphones.  That being said, the seats in Business are an unbelievable improvement over their previous product.  Also note that the Business Class restrooms near the front of the cabin (by the galley/walk-up bar) are much nicer than the Business Class restrooms at the rear of the cabin.  The ones in the rear are standard economy style, even though they are clearly part of the Business Class cabin."
15324,"The new configuration is torture even in the priority seats. AA has managed to add an extra seat making them unbearably tight. Im a small person and couldn't even read a magazine without disturbing my row mates. 
A couple of positives. Better seat pitch in the premium coach. It does offer a power and usb port but theres really no way to use a laptop. Even my ipad was stretching the space limitations. Seat 16c should be marked as yellow. Each time someone walked past they would bump the monitor, knocking out of viewing angle. 
Overall, an awful experience"
15325,"I made the 10 hour flight from DFW to Sao Paulo, Brazil in main cabin extra seat 17J. I'm just under 6'3"" and was able to sleep a bit, but the main cabin extra still felt claustrophobic and cramped. Granted it surely must have been better than economy. The overhead bin situation didn't help. They were worst I've ever seen on an airplane - seemed smaller and were awkward to open and close even for someone as tall as me. The bathrooms and mood lighting were nice though"
15326,This is the most comfortable plane Ive been on. I am a gold member and was given seat 17A. I had plenty of leg room and the seat was very comfortable. I will always try to get this aircraft when making long flights.
15327,"Legroom and entertainment system were good.  However i disliked this seat (and the plane) intensely.  The tray table is placed very low, on top of your knees, making it difficult to eat and impossible to move your legs while it is down.  Leg discomfort is increased by a curve on the edge of the seat cushion that compresses the back of the thighs (i am a 5ft 10in woman who weighs 160 lbs, I am not huge). Has AA not heard of DVT?  When i leaned the seat back, there was no lumbar support and i developed a horrible twist in my back.  I am a Gold member and usually sit in 31B on the old 777 plane.  That is a MUCH better seat."
15328,"beautiful plane!.. although row 3 & 4 in business appear to be ""cozy"" on the seat map, skip it and go back to the main part of the business class cabin.. the noise from the galley area is endless- for 7 full hours-- constant slamming of cabinets, clanging of dishes and crew chat.. bathrooms are hugely improved.. snak bar area is a huge win.. international wi-fi service is awesome.. overhead bin storage is very spacious-- can take oversized bags easily.. armrests are awkward-- due to angled seat configuration, one is much further away than the other.. awesome privacy within/between seats.."
15329,"Rows 3 & 4 are in a separate cabin which feels a bit more cozy.  3A & J only have 1 window each whereas most other seats in Business Class on this new 777-300ER have 2.  Not a big deal however, there is an A/C unit in the ceiling above this section that is very loud.  Also, the Business Class galley being just aft of row 4, it can be a bit noisy especially if you have a crew who enjoys slamming cart and cabinet doors.  I've flown in the regular Business Class cabin and would highly recommend it over rows 3 & 4."
15330,Entertainment system was great.  Lots of choices for movies and TV.  Seat was narrower than the other 777.  Tray table has to be carefully pushed in before folding up to latch.  It was always a problem.  Interesting lighting / different colors used during flight.  Bathrooms seem roomier and I could stand up without  a problem. I am 6 ft. 1 in.
15331,Seat feels quite private; comfortable; plenty of room and storage; meal was very good; quiet area and flight; no issues with crew kitchen activity or lavatory.  Almost felt like I was the only one on the plane.  I would sit here again.
15332,"This is a good product IMO. The Premium economy section is small, and feels fairly exclusive although the airline doesn't appear to curtain off either business up front or economy behind. 
The seat itself is large, wide and with plenty of legroom. I am 5'10 and it would be ample for anyone much taller I fancy. The leather seat is very comfortable for this 8 hour flight and there is plenty of space to store odds and ends that you tend to gather around yourself to make these flights go faster. There is power at every seat but it takes some finding - down at the back of the seat and hidden away a little. There is also a USB on the large IFE screen. On that matter, there is a large screen, working well as a touch screen and very clear. There is also a ton of choice on movies but I thought the audio selection was very poor but such things don't matter too much to me.
Service was pretty good. Not super friendly, but efficient and there when you want it. The response to my call button press was very fast (under a minute) and that is unusual and welcome. 
The 787 is a lovely plane - quiet and airy with very good lighting that changes as the light outside changes. I have had my issues with AA in the past but this is a great value option - I wouldn't spend a fortune on Business across the pond but this is a really good option I think."
15333,"The pod seats look cool.  They have no shoulder room, and except for the video controller, all other seat controls are cumbersome to reach in any other position except fully upright.  Furthermore, the foot rest is useless unless you recline.  Lastly, getting in/out of that seat is an issue as there is about 10 inches of foot space so one must turn and face the aisle to get out.  Would not recommend 1A.  3 out of 10 stars."
15334,The overhead bin above 2H is blocked for aircraft equipment.
15335,I flew in Premium Economy between ORD and CDG in September. I had seat 6L on the way to CDG and 7A on my return. I enjoyed seat 6L more than 7A. I liked the bulkhead seat even though we had to store our personal belongings during taxi/take-off. Neither the galley nor the lavatory were bothersome to me in seat 6L. I think the bulkhead seats 6J and 6L are preferable to 6A and 6C as the lavatory door on the right side of the plane is closer to the front of the plane than the lavatory on the left side due to the changing table in the right side lavatory (right side lavatory is much larger). Overall it was a great flight and I would book Premium Economy again on future long-haul flights.
15336,While the plane and its crew were quite good but the business class seats are not. I am only 6 feet tall and I could not stretch out because there is not enough length in the seats. They should be an inch or two wider to make them more comfortable. The hand controller for the screen at my seat was 'frozen' in map mode so I had to use the touch screen to control what I watched.
15337,"I flew in Seat 6A, and husband in 6D from Chicago to Rome and then Rome to Chicago recently.  The bulkhead seats in the Premium Economy cabin were fantastic.  We didn't feel confined and I commented that I didn't feel like I was flying.  I was able to get out of 6A and us the restroom without disturbing my husband in 6D.  You can hear a very light noise when the toilet flushes in front, but nothing that was disturbing.  We had no issues with anyone lingering by the restroom either since there was a galley right there.  We were able to use the restrooms directly in front of us as well as the ones in the very back. 
 However the galley directly in front of us was reserved for business passengers only with upgraded snacks.  We had pretzels only in our galley for snacks.  Service was top notch from our flight crew."
15338,"4H is an aisle seat in the middle on the right side of the plane. It's forward facing and is further away from 4D than the backward facing seats. I was traveling with someone and you had to lean forward to talk to them. Backward facing seats are better for those traveling together. American changed their menu on June 1st and everything was delicious. Roasted Chicken, Lamb, Chicken Fajita Sandwich. Would recommend 8/10."
15339,Seats 30A and C have additional space between  the 30A seat and the fuselage and under Seat 29A.  The electronic window dimming feature on these 787's is very handy to keep the cabin dark while flying east in the morning daylight.
15340,"The leg room is limited, especially limited for placing a carryon bag under seat in front, due to both an electronics box under the seat in front (so only very flat bags can slide under) and because the seat row legs do not line up with each seat, but are wider, so they cut off/narrow the width of leg room directly in front"
15341,5H is a business class seat. I am 6 foot tall and I found the business class capsules small for me even with the seat all the way back. 5H is also facing the galley so you spend the flight watching the crew relax and chatting and looking at the lighting. My son was in seat 1L and he had the same comment. All that being said BC was much more enjoyable than premium select which I had on the inbound flight or MCE which I flew earlier this year.
15342,Row 6-9 are premium economy seats on the version 2 of the 788. They are wider and more comfortable than the main cabin extra seats due to the 2-3-2 configuration vs 3-3-3. I would avoid the bulkhead row 6 if you have long legs or are tall unless you like bulkhead seats with no under seat storage. You are also close to the lav and galley. .
15343,"These business class seats have NOT gotten better than prior designs and configurations, they have gotten much, much worse.  Sure, the tabletop storage with charging is cool... but I fly business class to Asia to be able to sleep not have an improved storage space.  I am 6'4"" and these seats are AWFUL.  If you are over 6' tall please be aware you cannot lie flat with straight legs as the seat is too short and is even awkwardly angled.  Worse, it forces you to lie on your side, not bad in itself... but the tabletop shape only allows facing one direction.  You cannot turn over at all.  After sleeping on an airline lie flat for a couple of hours it can get pretty painful without being able to shift to your other side.  So... prepare to get a few hours sleep then become a miserable and frustrated tired airplane zombie.  Whichever design engineers and AA employees developed and approved these must have been 6' or less and didn't seem to consider anyone taller than them."
15344,"Tiny seat no leg room and barely wide enough.  Staff miserable, food awful.  Never again!"
15345,"37-J (aisle) protrudes into the aisle by approximately 1 to 1.5 inches. I was consistently bombarded with passing arms, hips and cart-brazing. So resting to your left is impossible. Hope that you don't have a middle seat-mate so that you can lay to your right instead."
15346,"The bulkhead does NOT interfere with full seat pitch.  Plenty of room.  This is true for all of row 11 premium economy.  I have flown in this row four times from LAX to AKL. 

It is true that Air New Zealand Premium has an extra 3 inches of pitch but timely shopping on American Airlines can get Premium for substantially less than Air New Zealand."
15347,"Flew to HND on this new jet,  the atmosphere was very relaxing and I felt refreshed when I arrived in Tokyo, also the plane is very quiet.  The seat itself was nice, plenty of room and the amenities and food were good, probably won't get bulkhead again as I don't like the tray table/TV setup but that is an issue with all airlines...I would recommend window seat instead of aisle as bathroom/FA traffic can be bothersome.."
15348,"DFW to Santiago and return.  Great business-class seat. Very private mini-compartment with comfortable sleep arrangement (I am 6'1"" and had plenty of room in the foot box).  Comfort of seat in mattress mode was quite good.  Reverse herringbone pattern of 787-9 is far preferable to the old 787-8 front/back facing, rock 'n roll, weird seats.  Too bad American is reverting to the 787-8 on the Santiago run..."
15349,"Seat pitch is inadequate for a 6'2"" person.  Your knees are tight up against the stiff wire at the top of the seat pocket.  You can't recline the seat as the bottom of it slides forward, jamming your knees even more into that horrible piece of wire. If, like me and the guy next to me, if you weigh 100kg or so, you are going to be tight up against each other for the whole flight"
15350,"This seat has a lot of storage space, and it is easy to get out to the aisle."
15351,"PVG-DFW The seat was a great standard business class seat no, complaints about the seat itself, layout is much better that 787-8.  Only complaint is that 5A is missing a window.  I love flying and was excited for the two windows every AA business class seat gets, but was very disappointed when I found that 5A only has 1 window.  The one window you do get is in the front part of your seat, so every time I wanted to look out the window I had to straighten my seat back and lean forward.
Wonderful aircraft and beautiful business class, would probably just get a different business class window seat next time though."
15352,"As the first row of premium economy this seat enjoys a much wider leg room, also more convenient for the person sitting near the window going to aisle without bothering other passengers."
15353,"787-9:  this seat has one window however it is a quiet sanctuary, is not impacted by the galley or lavratories, contrary to its yellow icon.  This seat offers extreme privacy as there js no one next to you Instead there is a wall.  The lavatory is located far behind after entry door.  Love it!!!!"
15354,"I submitted a review for Seat 9C earlier and is mentioned below as well. 9A was pretty much the same except we did not get slippers from Shanghai 
 to Dallas. When asked, I was told they're only for business class which is weird since we got it from Dallas to Shanghai.

Here's the review I wrote for 9C:
Exceeded all my expectations. The seat is wide enough and the leg rest proved to be valuable during the 14hr flight. Food is served to the premium economy section separately so ignore the announcements about what's included in the meal as that's only for regular economy. Food itself was good and presented very nicely on a tray with real silverware instead of plastic and was even cleaned up as soon as I finished. Attendants were definitely more attentive in the prem eco section.

The amenity kit was Cole Hann and really nice. Came with slippers as well.

There is plenty of leg room in this bulkhead seat. Person sitting at the window could get out without me moving or getting up from my seat. Would travel this again."

15356,"Seat 1L is private and quiet. Yes, it's next to the right side galley entrance, but unless the FAs were serving, it was not noisy or bright as they kept the curtain closed.  It felt like being on the plane alone, it was so private. 
A potential drawback would be being so far from the door, but the FAs do block the Premium/Economy passengers until all Business class pax have exited the plane.
Plus, this side of the plane usually gets nice views of Sydney / harbour upon departure is a bonus."
15357,The faux leather material on the hard seats made the economy class pretty difficult for a trans-pacific journey.  It was very similar to the AA A321 experience.  The seatback entertainment was really pretty good (I've flown QANTAS and Air Canada previously on a similar route) but the seat was pretty awful.  The CRJ700 I got on to come home had a much more comfortable seat.
15358,"This was an excellent seat with a LOT of legroom.  I'm 6'2"" with long legs and I had no problem stretching my legs out.  It's a very nice section of the plane with just 3 rows and walls on each side.  Very good value."
15359,I got seat 11J from DFW to ORD and I loved it! 11J and 11L both recline all the way despite the full bulkhead behind you. The foot rest didn't work too well as it seems they designed it only for shorter folks
15360,"Shanghai-DFW. A flying torture chamber. All econ seats are awful - narrow and hard. Aisles are impassable and, imo, unsafe. Service largely non-existent except for 3 quickies during 13+ hour flight. Tech is good, but config and cranky service spoil it. Avoid at all costs !!"
15361,"This is a main cabin extra seat and it was awesome! I had this seat for the 11 hour flight from Los Angeles to NRT. The bulkhead row 12 seats have way more legroom than the main cabin extra seats in rows 13 and 14. I was able to get up and sit as many times as I needed without interrupting my neighbors and I had 2 windows at my seat. I also had the same power ports that everyone else had. Sure you may not be able to store anything at your feet for takeoff and landing but what difference does that make when you can get up with ease as many times as you want. Only complaint was that the seat was slightly hard and this is the case with all economy seats. For reference, my height is 5'10"" and I am submitting the above comments."
15362,"The overall flight experience was excellent. The only drawback is that the seat was a bit narrow, so I did not have much shoulder room for my 5'9"" height."
15363,"AA Business class has really stepped up to compete with Cathay and JAL. The new 787 is well trimmed, very comfortable and really no downside anymore in comparison. Great business class pods."
15364,"I truly despise the 787 at 9 across but MCE gives you a little break, at least in leg room. The seats are too close together so the aisles are narrow. At least I shared 13D and E with my wife so it wasn't terrible. Everything else is fine with the entertainment and expected level of service. I will say 12 C and J are the worst seats. The extra room is negated by the narrow and changing aisle. They were hit EVERY time a cart came through."
15365,"""Main Cabin Extra"" seat 12C from NRT to LAX was terrible. Sure, you have a lot of legroom. Not having floor storage is a minor inconvenience. Getting hit in the right arm/shoulder every time a flight attendant walks by is awful. The person sitting in 12D had no such issue."
15366,"11J is a typical premium economy seat, however, it does not recline at all."
15367,This is the best seat in coach! It's just you and the aisle. This row isn't a bulkhead (9) and doesn't have limited recline (11). And it feels like domestic first class. Loved the flight.
15368,Flight 82 from AKL to LAX. 29J has very little room as a standard seat.
15369,"This was by far the worst flight I have had crossing the Pacific!This is a 15+ hour flight! This particular seat is squeezed in right up against the side of the airplane. The Emergency exit in front of it to protrudes at least 1/2 a foot into the legroom space of this seat. This results in the occupant to sit crooked in the seat with your head firmly pressed on the side of the airplane. This siding conveniently follows the contour of the airplane leaving it very cramped for tall and or large individuals. As far as the noise goes it is transmitted through any part of your body which is in contact with the panelling on the side of the airplane. 
This would be your head, your arm and leg on the side in contact. This leaves your body is buzzing for the entire flight leaving you very fatigued at the end of the flight. The seat on the other side of this row 24L would be the same. Imagine being at the dentist and having a root canal for 15 hours."
15370,Best long haul flite ever.  Sydney to LAX in my own private world.  Comfortable cubicle with nice storage and good padding on the seat.  It would go flat for sleeping but I do not go flat.  More upright and very comfortable.  Typical AA business class food.  Good but not great.  Temperature was cool but not cold.  Lighting was good for reading.  Only complaint was my wife was in 4D and they are not directly across from each other and really had no communication.
15371,"How AA can expect someone over 6' to sit for 15 hours on an international flight in a 16"" wide seat with a 31"" pitch is beyond me.  Attendant took pity on a few of us and moved us to aisle 24 on the bulkhead with at least some legroom. Overall, a terrible flying experience. Never AA again."
15372,"3D wasn't working and my companion's seat, 3H, malfunctioned as well. We were reassigned 1D and 1L prior to takeoff which was fortunate because at least 6 other seats didn't work. The flight attendant said that the seats cost $10K apiece and are a constant headache. Seats 1D and 1H are indeed noisy due to the proximity to the galley and lavatories."
15373,"I paid extra to upgrade to the exit row because I have two fused ankles and it is very difficult to get them under the seat in front of me. That said, I did get the extra leg room I was after but the shoulder room was horrible. Because there is no window for this row, there is less shoulder space. I spent my entire flight with my arms practically crossed in front of me. Even the arm rest doesn't appear to be in line with the wall of the plane so it's pretty useless. I can't believe I paid extra for this seat. On the other AA plane I flew on (the other leg of the trip) I also had an exit row but middle seat. The difference was that there was no window seat in this case to my left. That was perfect. They crammed this seat into the 787 and it was terrible. I would avoid it unless petite."
15374,The seat reclined fully but it was so tiny. I felt so squished and miserable the entire flight.
15375,"Seat 9H is a mixed bag. The legroom (I'm 6'6"") is great for a 13 hour flight. I was able to sleep pretty well on the flight once the cabin settled down. However for part of the flight, the noise from the galley was noticeable. The overhead bin was had plenty of room as it was for row 9 only and made up for the lack of under seat storage. I'd fly this plan and seat again for long haul flights that are 9 plus hours if it's available."
15376,"My American Airlines flight from LAX to DFW on New Year Eve was on the 787-900. Seat 5A only has 1 window, where all first class has 2. Looks like an airduct. I was disappointed I only had 1 window as an AVGeek. 

Michael"
15377,AKL-LAX Food was terrible mixed nuts were overheated creating burned mushy nuts. Entrée: Filet& shrimp had condensate juice from shrimp mixing in with filet done well. Ordered cognac after dinner and was told it was not on the planes inventory even though it was on the drink menu. When I complained to the stewardess she said she did me a favor by serving me 2 plastic cups of Champagne! You mean sparkling wine! Business seat came with Casper bed topper not a game changer.
15378,"I have seen some negative comments on the new AA787-9 planes, but I dont understand them in Business Class.  Seat 8A is located back a little, but I found that it was extremely quiet and undisturbed.  AA provides mattresses for the flight, which was the most comfortable bed I have ever had on a plane.  I slept for over 7 hours.  I would seak this seat out again on any AA flight.  The food was OK, but the crew was excellent."
15379,"My wife and I flew ORD to CDG R/T. Seats comfortable but narrow. Fixed armrest on one side greatly restricts space when in flat mode. Foot well narrows as well. My size 11 feet touched both the bottom and top of the foot well. I cannot believe AA did not install partition between center aisle seats. Be prepared to see and hear everything, including the video screen from your seatmate. FA's never pulled curtain and glaring light from galley the entire flight."
15380,Flew AKL-LAX on 12/1/17. Tiny seat with minimal legroom made worse when person in 17A reclined for entire flight. Seat was smaller than on AA's MD-80 domestic fleet. Great entertainment system partly made up for it. Toilets seem bigger than average.
15381,"We took this 15 hour flight from LAX to SYD. The entire row 24 is awful.   The toilets in the nearby lavs flush very loud.  Plenty of leg room, but the crew and passengers use the center section as a cut through.  We had people stepping on our feet all night long.  The two outside sections of row 24 are no better.  Passengers stand in front of you while waiting to use the lavs or use it as an excercise area.  These seats are only 17 inches wide due to the tray in armrest.  Flight attendants struggle to get meal and drink carts down the aisle.  Nice plane, bad seating design by American."
15382,"This exit row seat is a tight squeeze because the door takes your legroom. Im 6-1 230 lb and I usually go out of my way to get these exit row seats, but on this flight I had to switch to non-exit row aisle seat because it was too tight."
15383,"Due to my AA status, we were upgraded from regular coach to Main Cabin Extra for free.  Although that meant a few inches more pitch, the seats are very narrow.  Our seats were in the bulkhead at row 12.  Because the tray table is in the arms, the seats are even more narrow.  And the tray tables are really tiny.  The service was OK but pretty rushed.  Don't recommend these seats unless you weigh less that 110 lbs."
15384,"I flew both ways between LAX and AKL.  I generally agree with existing comments.  The galley noise didnt bother me much, but i kept headphones or earbuds on almost the entire flight even when i wasnt listening to anything.  I could definitely understand some people being bothered by the noise when the galley got busy.  Otherwise the seat was great.  My only gripe is that AA locks the windows on their 787s in the opaque setting during the flight.  This makes the seat more of a wall seat instead of a window seat.  Particularly for night flights, I dont understand the point of this."
15385,"I flew in 2a on the new 787-9 from Auckland to lax.  New plane and crew werent sure where to find things.  Seat 2a is a problem,  you have a harsh florescent light in your eyes the whole flight.  Crew is unable to dim it since it is right outside the cockpit.  First couple of rows are pretty noisy with the galley too.  I would opt for a seat in mid to rear of the business class cabin."
15386,"Seat 1D, 2D, 1H and 2H have no overhead storage"
15387,"Seat 24L is decpetive. It looks like a great exit row seat until you sit down. The sidewall does not indent so there is no shoulder room. The exit door then extends out of the sidewall and into your leg/knee space. The only way my 6'1"" frame can comfortably sit in this seat is to lean comepletely forward, which is not very comfortable either."
15388,"I was excited to be in a 787 for the first time and then was immediately let down by it due to its narrow and hard seat, way shorter leg room and no way to stretch even a slight bit while seated in the seat. When AA280/281 flew 777 it was way better, at least for the economy seats."
15389,"Lots of noise from the crew in the galley for the entire flt from Paris to DFW.i think they were taking inventory or something.  Also, you have to squeeze by the attendants each time that you go to the bathroom."
15390,"The seat was not comfortable. It had a headrest with a split between it and the seat, so when you lay flat you have a little gap to fill. The arm rest was broken and banged every time I moved. This was a newer aircraft with the herringbone layout. The ""clanging"" from the FA's in the galley was over the top, so choose a seat away from the galley. American did not score any points with this trip-very disappointed at this price point."
15391,Limited oberhead bin storage due to 1H not having any overhead bin storage and mist share. Also exremely noisy from attendants chatting in forward galley.
15392,"Seoul to Dallas 23 May 17. Noticed the extra leg room as part of main cabin extra feature. Was able to put bag under seat in front and stretch out legs on top of bag for foot rest. But the most narrowest seats i've ever experienced and with minimal seat back decline. FA service was average. There was no water offered between the two meals and snack unless i happened to sleep through it, so i was lucky to bring a bottle of water with me."
15393,"Great seat. I really like this small ""Premium Economy"" cabin. Seats are comfortable, footrest is nice touch. Cabin is quiet. Entertainment is very good although it is a small screen that pulls up from the armrest. Restroom in front of this row is also shared by Business and is the larger restroom. Meals are served on real dishes with real silverware! However, I always order gluten free and mine was served in the plastic containers and flimsy plastic flatware the same as regular coach. I wrote to AA about this. Windows that dim or blackout by remote are a nice touch. No more flimsy plastic pulldown shades. I agree with another comment about the cabin atmosphere not seeming so dry on this plane. I would definitely fly in this cabin again."
15394,"I really like this seat. It did not bother me being close to the galley. The restroom behind me on this side of the plane is the larger one. Very nice. Lighting is updated and very good. Entertainment--movies were great. Bed was a little hard but it does lie flat which is good. It would be nice if they provided a pad for the bed as was provided on the 77W. Food was good. However, the ""champagne"" served was not the real kind that was listed on the menu. It was domestic and thus not really champagne. Overall good experience in business class. My husband was next to me and seats are situated so that we could talk and see each other."
15395,"New lie-flat BIZ seat.  I LOVED IT!  It was ""snug"" for your feet, but shoulders and hips were quite comfy and MUCH more comfortable than current wide-body angled lie-flat seats.  Space was great and working areas adequate."
15396,"Flew business class DFW-MAD in feb 17.  Plane is really nice .very spacious and you can fell the improvement in cabin pressurization after a 9 hour flight. New buainess class seat is okay. Very comfortable for seating but the lie flat is fairly hard and tight if you are over 6 ft . Lots of video entertainment choices but the wired remote still screams 1998.  Service was exceptional going over, on par with foreign airlines i have flown. Coming back it was stereotypical - tenured flight attendanta who acted annoyed you were there."
15397,"19Feb17, 24B:  Pro:  Plenty of leg room as this is an exit row.  Cons:  The seat  feels much narrower than the 777 or even 763.  The IFE is stored next to the seat, which was slightly problematic, but the tray table was of greater concern.  It leaned to one side, so I had to hold my meals to prevent wearing them.  
I would not book 24A because the aircraft door juts in a little and limits space.  Typical AA food and drink service and the FA's were friendly.  One of them told me she didn't like the 789 because there was little food prep space in the galleys."
15398,First time trying american premium economy cabin and absolutely loved it. Bulkhead seats have full foot rest.very specious and nice seat. Has a little storage area under the armrest.
15399,Nice seat however did not like the fact that table was under the tv and both tv and the table were not move able so not very comfortable to sleep when half of the body is under the table/tv set
15400,"I always choose American Airlines im my trips to US. My records show more than 1 million miles in AA
This new 787 is one of the worst planes i have travelled. The seats are narrow and closer to the front chair. Finally a comment: The plane is new but the passenger is not American firt choice."
15401,"I had the opportunity to fly on AA 963 on November 14 from DFW to GRU (Guarulhos - Sao Paulo, Brazil), the equipment was a Boeing 787-900 with AA's new International Premium Economy class. The aircraft went into service on this route on November 3, so it had been operating less than two weeks on this route.

Upon boarding, a shrink-wrapped plastic bundle was waiting on each Premium Economy seat; it contained a fleecy blanket, pillow with patterned paper pillowcase, over-the-ear headphones, and an amenity kit consisting of a felt envelope containing an eye mask, ear plugs, disposable socks, and compact toothbrush/toothpaste. If you unwrap all of it, there isn't really anyplace  to put it other than shoved next to you in the seat or under you in the seat.

Mine was the first flight for many of AA's flight attendants on this plane. They were unfamiliar with the class of service and AA's intentions for the cabin. They were also unfamiliar with how to deploy bulkhead-row infotainment screens and how the seats controls are meant to work.

Probably because of the flight attendants' unfamiliarity with the plane, cadence of service was off.  The flight attendants were hand- carrying a lot of items from the rear galley to the forward galley which is immediately ahead of the Premium Economy cabin (between Premium Economy and Business Class). I overheard discussion that some food/beverage wasn't catered to the correct galley. 

After what seemed like an eternity, we got snack/drink service, though the snack was delivered and drink order taken, but it took about 10 min for my gin and tonic to arrive (and it arrived without the gin). Immediately thereafter dinner arrived- no time to enjoy my cocktail before dinner. When dinner was served, it came with a wine glass on the tray, but no offer of wine was made (and indeed, the wine I did finally get was poured into a plastic cup instead of being poured into the wine glass on my tray).  The dinner was all on porcelain dinnerware, except for the hot entree which was served in a plastic disposable tray. The meal itself was OK- at least the food on the real plates. There was a prawn cocktail, green salad, and lemon cake for dessert. The main had the typical ""Chicken or Pasta?"" options; the chicken in the disposable I chose tray was typical back-of-the-plane fare. 

Cadence of service was off at breakfast service (60 min before arrival) too- the food preceded the drinks cart by 15 min. Breakfast consisted of fresh fruit, a warm cinnamon bun, and some yogurt. I'll give a dishonorable mention to the coffee served with breakfast- it was truly terrible, to the point of being undrinkable brown fluid. It tasted like the inside of the plastic pitcher from which it had been poured. 


Some comments on the cabin itself - it's just 3 rows of 2-3-2 configuration (rows 9-11); each seat has its own video screen (larger than economy), its own armrests (one of which contains a tray table, the other has storage and a mains outlet for charging devices). At the bulkhead, the leg/footrests were great and legroom was good, though the leg rest is too short to support my long legs properly. The seat width was appreciated, and very noticeable when walking back through the economy cabin to use the lavatory. The seat's headrest is adjustable, and it has flaps on each side to support the head for napping, though the 15% max seat recline isn't enough to really get comfortable.


There is a lav-occupied indicator on the bulkhead at front of cabin, for the two lavatories immediately ahead of the cabin. But the Flight Attendants repeatedly told us that those lavatories were only for business class passengers only - so why is there a signal about their availability in our cabin? Our cabin is to be using the lavatories in Economy, behind row 23.

There is a curtain at the row 9 bulkhead to separate business class (and its galley/lavatories) from premium economy. But the FAs constantly came thru the curtain; the curtain was always brushing my legs in seat 9H throughout the 9h30m flight.  it was incredibly irritating- why bother closing the curtain if they're constantly going to be ducking under it?

While on the flight I watched the movie ""A Bigger Splash"" - it was utterly bizarre, both boring and irritating, but it had the line ""Premium economy- sounds like a pen for dirty animals"". Made me chuckle. Inflight entertainment options were actually pretty good on AA's system; in addition to that move I was able to watch Absolutely Fabulous the Movie; Bad Moms, Crazy Stupid Love, and Spy with Melissa McCarthy. 

My trip home on AA 962 on November 18 came at the end of a very long day. I worked all day, leaving the office in Sao Caetano at 5:30 PM; the taxi ride to the airport took 90 minutes. The 10:55 PM departure meant several hours to spend in the Admirals Club, which was fine. Boarding was a bit confused due to ""Priority AAcess"" never being called, but there was still room for my rolling bag and backpack overhead from my bulkhead Seat 9L.  

Upon sitting down, I was handed a Premium Economy dinner menu- that had been missing on the flight down. The dinner entree choices were Salmon or pasta.  On a plane out of São Paulo? Damn straight I chose pasta. 

Once underway, there was no cocktail service; the drink offered was what I wanted to drink with dinner. Once again I got wine in a plastic cup, then was handed a dinner tray with a wineglass on it. 

Even the pasta entree came on a real plate this time... and it looked pretty and tasted amazing. Really. Also on the meal tray were a very nice meat/cheese plate, and green salad, a roll with butter, and a cake.

Breakfast was served about an hour before arrival; it was yogurt, a warm roll, and what was probably the freshest, tastiest fruit I've ever had on an airplane. I skipped the coffee this time around.

Overall AA's Premium Economy class is an upgrade from Economy (and even Main Cabin Extra), and is better than the EVA and BA Premium Economy cabins I've flown in the past 18 months (largely because the plane is newer, so has chargers and large in-flight entertainment display screens). While nowhere near business class levels of comfort, the Premium Economy cabin makes the long-haul flight more bearable!"
15402,"Seat 10D is in the new Premium Economy class.  Those seats are nice, but the legroom  is no better than that of Main Cabin Extra.  The foot-rests of seats on rows 10 and 11 are a joke.  Ridiculous.  They are just a small support for the feet (I am 6'2""and if I used them my feet would just be pushed up) whereas row 9 has a real foot/leg rest that unfolds forward from underneath the seat .  The trays ara all in the armrests, which are bulky and do not retract up.  So if you are next to an empty seat, you will not be able to stretch to the side (you would be better off in Main Cabin Extra without anyone sitting next to you).  The economy seats on this plane are very narrow (both economy and main cabin extra).  Premium Economy seats are wider.  But seatbacks do not recline much more than those of economy or main cabin extra.  Besides not having the tray on the back of the seat in front, the storage compartment (with magazines, barf bags etc) is rigid.  You cannot put even a small bottle of water there.  Food is OK.  The lighting scheme inside the 787 is interesting, but American does not darken the cabin enough.  You need eye shades if you like a dark environment to sleep.  I did not feel the ""moister"" cabin atmosphere that has been advertised for this plane."
15403,"Flew MAD-DFW. Great seat - tons of cubbies and storage, intuitive controls and great lighting.  Best seats in business cabin are window seats (A or L in rows 3-6). Lavs are just ok - nothing special and no amenities beyond soap.  Also, location for biz class pax is awkward.   You cannot access a lav without going through a galley.  Otherwise - a great improvement on the 787-8"
15404,"Flew LAX-DFW. This seat offers outstanding leg room and knee room. I'm 6'6"" and could not reach the bulkhead with my fully outstretched legs. As an exit row seat, it is slightly narrower than your typical coach seat, but not irritatingly or painfully so (AA's new A321 exit rows are the industry leader in excruciating narrowness, in my opinion). The flight attendant does sit directly in front of you for takeoff and landing, but there is so much room that it still doesn't feel cramped. Only real drawback is that the window is slightly misaligned due to the exit door, so don't expect to get great views out of those large and lovely 787 windows."
15405,"privacy = none in the middle seats , you can open some cabin divisories , but still some heavy eye and tv contact , that may botter some people. Go for the windows seats. They have a better privacy. If you are used to the 787-8 , this is way better, but I'm still a fan of the 777-3 BC"
15406,"Row 18 is directly over the wings. Windows are offset. The seats are a little too firm for my taste, and the legroom is pretty tight. DON'T drop anything or you'll have a really hard time retrieving it."
15407,"Flew LAX to DFW and they finally got the bizz class seats right,  after the junk in the 787-8. All forward facing, no control console blocking the fantastic windows,  and just incredibly better.  Too bad they most likely will not update the 788s.  Also I sat for a bit in MCE in second row.  2-3-2 wide seats are great and I would have stayed there happily had they not moved me up front.  Too bad we'll never see a 789 on my normal SAntiago to LAX route."
15408,"I flew on a one-week-old 787 from LAX to DFW. The pilot said these were shakedown flights before the aircraft began flying routes from the U.S. to the far east. Like others, I found the seat to be quite narrow and the fuselage of the aircraft encroached into my seat's headspace. Unlike others here, I found the aisle was no narrower than main cabin aisles in other aircraft and the seat cushion did not tilt up enough to notice, even though I was paying attention to it. I liked the electronic window shades because they allow you to cut down on extreme sunlight while still being able to see outside. The seat-back IFE worked perfectly. The extra leg room of MCE was great. the lack of IFE boxes under the seats was a welcome surprise because I always have a bag to put under the seat in front of me. I really liked having individual air vent and light controls at my seat, something I miss on some 777s. Unfortunately, when we landed at DFW the ground crew had trouble aligning the jet bridge with the new aircraft, which caused a delay and embarrassment for AA, considering DFW is their home airport."
15409,"The single seats along the windows offer a very private flying experience. The seat electronics are overly complicated, with a small tablet-like touch screen for selecting from a vast array of seat positions. At one point my seat control simply became unresponsive and the flight attendant had to ""reboot my seat"". Who'd ever thought that sentence would exist?"
15410,"The new lay flat business seats are very private with the window seats angled towards the windows and the centers angled towards each other you have a very secluded feel.
The seats are a very good quality and a pleasant dark brown fabric which makes for a comfortable seat. Going fully flat into the bed is easy but it does resemble a coffin somewhat with very narrow foot space and a wider bowl up towards the head and shoulders.
American gives the width as 21-26 inches and I found that unless I scooted all the way up towards the top of the head portion my shoulders touched both sides when lying on my back. I am not a big guy - 5'9"" and 190 pounds so taller, broader people may need to put the aisle arm rest down so they are not bumping their shoulders. At least that is a good option.
Row 5 does only have one window as opposed to two and so does the back row , row 8.
The windows are huge and the electronic dimming is amazing - you can set it to a deep blue while cruising. A very quiet aircraft and noticeable better on your airways and nasal passages without drying you out."
15411,"The new Premium Economy cabin is a very small cabin with only three rows of seats with a bulk head of sorts behind separating from Main Cabin Extra. The seat width is a big improvement from the typical coach seats American offers and the additional legroom is more or less on par with what you find in domestic first class at 38 inch pitch. With a two, three, two layout the middle seat in the center is tough and needs a person on the aisle to get up and move out to let someone out. The seats have wider arm rests as well so you are not competing for the arm rest with the person next to you. 
Good amount of recline and having a foot rest does make this a very comfortable alternative to standard coach or even MCE. The window two seats are the best bet."
15412,Even though close to galley the seat was very private and noise was minimal. There were 2 windows so the view outside was very nice. The TV screens are large and there are several
15413,Only 1 window at 5A and 5H. Structural item occupies where other window should be. Wish someone wrote this seat review before me so I could have picked another seat. I fly to look out windows.
15414,"I have flown this A319 a couple of times. One of the few American planes that seem to maintain a decent time table and not get delayed. 14A was for the most part comfortable, there is not a left arm rest that is reachable. There were personal TVs on my plane, that worked great. The plane was very quite too. Seat had pretty good cushion, I would fly this over most regional jets and any of the 737s. Bathrooms are pretty decent size too."
15415,"When AA introduced the A319 a few years ago, with the monitors I the seats, they were truly awful--like being wedged in a coffin.  Monitors are no more, but the 30"" inch pitch is very uncomfortable for someone 6-3 with arthritic knees.  Don't ask AA the take a row out, not in these days of nickeling and diming you for everything imaginable.  A321s are much better."
15416,"Truly terrible seat.  The bulkhead panel is straight from the floor to the ceiling - no bend in the panel for leg room.  But the panel separating the tiny first-class section to the premier-economy section has a bend to allow an extra foot of leg-room.  The 8D bulkhead seat is actually a better seat than the 1D.  I was upgraded to 1D and I sat in the seat and found even less leg room than in the back of the bus.  I gave up that seat and returned to my previously assigned seat, 10D.  It was a much better experience.  Maybe a tiny person would like 1D but anyone with regular-sized legs would be infuriated to have paid extra for this seat."
15417,There is no room for your legs. My son's legs touched the seat in front. It is so tight you cannot reach down and access your bag under the seat in front of you. THis is a total safety hazard.
15418,"Worst seats in aplane
You do not have any space ..I am 5'3"" and my knees were touching the seat in the front, 
in my way back i upgrade the seat to Extra cabin and I was confortable, but main cabin it is imposible to fly more than 1 hour !!!"
15419,"So you want to have the most cramped uncomfortable ride anywhere? Then book on American Airlines and fly on this plane. You won't be disappointed. 

I booked this flight from Barbados to Charlotte.
I'm 5'8"" and usually don't have a problem even in standard coach. I couldn't even open my laptop without they keyboard in my belly and straining my neck to see the screen because the person in front of me had their seat back (So Did I). 

The problem with AA is they are trying to make more money and expecting customers to live with their actions. Speak with your pocket book folks!!

I'm a Diamond on Delta, was thinking about doing a challenge on AA but after this flight home from Barbados  and the flight from home to Barbados on American Airlines I can honestly say I'll never fly American Airlines again, and If they are the only carrier to get where I need to go I'll be cancelling my trip."
15420,"7:30PM departure from MIA to SFO. Not lie flat/pod seats, just basic domestic first class seats. They do not have Bose/high quality headsets for the entertainment system, which is pretty weak considering the shift to bluetooth."
15421,"This was the most cramped seat I have ever been in by far. A total joke...I will NEVER fly in this airplane again. Packed in like sardines, forget picking anything up off the ground, forget putting anything other than a phone in the pouch on the back of the seat in front of you.  Try to put an IPAD in that pouch? Forget it! I repeat, this is by far thee worst seating I have ever encountered."
15422,"This is the worst seat i have ever had.  American Airlines, looks like i will switch back to SWA"
15423,Extremely short leg space. Almos you dont fit in. Only one bag storage bin.
15424,"I fly on this plane from Miami to Manaus, Brazil frequently.  There is really no comfort on this plane, anywhere!  If you can avoid it.  Otherwise, this first row of the First/Business Class cabin for me works better than the second row.  I put my roll-on case in front of me, so my feet and legs have a nice place to rest and they are not just hanging there for 5 hours."
15425,"I found the foot space was very adequate, and I am a large person.  The seat was wide enough for me and I was pretty comfortable.  I had to bring my own seatbelt extender as AA didn't have one."
15426,"FYI, for the A319 with seat back entertainment the A/V boxes take some valuable leg room."
15427,"Be aware that there are two versions of the A319: the ones ordered by AA before their merger with US Airways have IFE screens and an AC outlet between the Y seats. All AA A319s have identical layout and seats, but the planes ordered by US Airways before the merger lack IFE and AC power outlets.

I don't know how to tell which one you'll get prior to departure other than the AA-bought planes have swept-up winglets and the US ones have small bladed ones that extend above and below the wings."
15428,"There is no arm rest for the left arm, so its uncomfortable. But you do get massive leg room and two windows."
15429,This was a flight from las vegas to philadelphia. The seat is listed as an exit row seat. Its actually just a normal isle seat but it feels better because the window seat has no seat in front of it. It just opens up the row a bit. The plane is that new version with a bathroom by the exit row. No tv
15430,"This first class seat is just fine. I would much rather bring my own device than stare at a tiny airline screen. BTW, my iPad case hangs perfectly in the upper magazine slot, yet, i can move it anywhere i desire.  There IS a power outlet - in the center console storage. Best power arrangement as can have plugged in device during takeoff/landing w/o cords blocking egress. An efficient layout"
15431,"On A319 AA1709 on 2/8/2018 from phx to sjc
Under seat area is obstructed, and legroom is restricted"
15432,"I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort of this seat. It was a little wider than a comparable seat on a 737, enough wider that it made a real difference in my comfort. I also had plenty of legroom. I will be seeking out this aircraft for future flights."
15433,The windows were offset. I had to either lean forward or look back to see out a window.
15434,"1-F is very pleasant.  The small 1st class seems to have enough overhead space, even if full, as you board first, extra bags can go above the first rows of coach and someone will hand them to you.  Leg room just OK but I can nap just fine in this seat."
15435,"When AA introduced the A319 a few years ago I thought it was horrible and said so on this site. They have been reconfigured with the same comfortable seats found in the latest A321s and are lights years better.  I am 6-3, and even at 31"" inch pitch they are satisfactory.  I sprung for MCE on this flight and it was the most comfortable coach ride I have had in years. There is ample foot room and the seat back is high enough that it does not hit me in the middle of my neck like the MD80s when trying to recline.  Seat engineers did a good job on these, thanks, AA."
15436,"I found this seat to have restricted legroom compared to row 2 because, it's a bulkhead seat, but it reclined unlike row 2 seats.  Overhead storage bin was usable for this row."
15437,"No IFE, no power outlets. The first class seat is very thin, not comfortable with very little recline.  I can only image how bad economy must be"
15438,"This is an updated aircraft which has a IFE in every seatback - welcome surprise.  Even in premium economy leg space is somewhat limited, if you have a bag under the seat,  due to power unit for the IFE.  No bag and you can stretch reasonably well, I'm 5'10 Seat is comfy and decent for a 3hr flight"
15439,The left arm rest for 14A is actually on the emergency exit and slightly higher and more forward than the arm rest on the right. This is less than ideal and should be included in the comments for both 14A and 14 F.
15440,I was pleasantly surprised  with the amount of leg room in my seat. Even with my (packed to the gills) back pack under the seat in front of me I had plenty of room for my legs. Loved that there was an outlet built into the seats in front of me. Flight crew was kind and courteous.
15441,"This seat seemed pretty tight for a 30"" pitch."
15442,"On my flight (MIA-YYZ), although the tray tables in the emergency exit row (row 14) were indeed on the seat back as a previous commenter wrote, there was ALSO for some reason another set of tray tables in the arm rests, making them immovable."
15443,The overhead bin was empty and accessible. The emergency equipment was in a side compartment over the coat closet. Decent seat.
15444,"IND-PHX There were no personal screens on this aircraft. There was a few movies/TV shows available to stream and stated as free but we could never get connected. Updated interior with leather seats, plane was clean and service good. Tight squeeze in row 24. We sat in MCE on our way back to Indy (row 9 flight 500)no screens again but much better seats. There appears to be a partition between each window on this aircraft so you kinda have two windows per row but they don't exactly align. All in all, good flights."
15445,"My flight had no screens at all in any class.  One had to stream movies, etc on phone, tablet or laptop.  Weird if one wasn't prepared with headphones."
15446,Great seat; plenty of leg room and leather seat.
15447,"A metal box, about 2 inches thick, is attached to the bottom frame of the seat in front of this one.  It cuts down on leg room and under seat storage"
15448,"The seats appear to have been recently reconfigured to give less leg room, smaller pitch and a very cramped economy cabin. The armrests are hard plastic. All upholstery has been removed. Uncomfortable!"
15449,"With the new upgrade, the tray tables in the exit row are in the seat back in front of you and the arm rests are movable."
15450,"Great seat.  Must have been an older version because no IFE from BNA to LAX.  I'm 5'9 and 34"" of pitch is fantastic.  Very comfy overall.  Crew was nice, nothing special.  I definitely would take this flight/seat again."
15451,Cramped. Avoid row 13. Pitch very small.
15452,Really bad seat of you are tall. The space on front of the seat is reduced due to what im assuming is part of the wiring of the entretainment system. Additionally the seat is small and the window is slightly forward.
15453,The legroom in the bulkhead is more limited in the newly retrofitted planes. (Or are they new?) The wall at the bulkhead is straight from ceiling to floor--formerly it angled out slightly allowing more leg room. I love the bulkhead but this newly limited legroom may change my future seat selection.
15454,Utility box consumes foot room
15455,Utility box consumes foot room
15456,Utility box consumes foot space
15457,Utility box consumes foot space
15458,Great leg room.  Almost no recline.
15459,"There is another version of the A319, which are the ex-US Airways that have been reconfigured with the same seating but no IFE. There were also only 2 power outlets. I believe most LAX-YYZ flights are flown with this non-IFE configuration. It had gogo-inflight though. Still highly uncomfortable and very limited pitch for a coast to coast flight."
15460,"Flew GCM-MIA. Seat pitch is miserable, and IFE box under the seat further reduces leg room. Seat itself was reasonably comfortable for a short hop. IFE is nice, but personally I'd prefer to lose it altogether in exchange for another couple inches of seat pitch so my knees wouldn't have to be in contact with the seat in front of me. If you are over six feet tall, I recommend avoiding this aircraft unless you are in first, MCE, or emergency exit row."
15461,Standard domestic first class seat.  Fresh leather seat surfaces.  New 120V outlets at all seats.  Next door seat  mate told me of a recent fire back in economy related to one of these outlets.  Exceptional food!.  YES!!  Restaurant quality!!  Attentive and extremely friendly flight crew.  Will take this flight again.
15462,The 'A and E' seats will not permit the Ciao brand underseat rolling bag to be stored underneath the seat in front due to a built in obstruction on the right rear leg.
15463,"I flew on this plane just last month and AA recommended 14D. This was a newly renovated ex-US A319 which has the same seat setup and features as the legacy AA A319, minus the seatback TV. It was an averave flight, we were delayed an hour due to bad weather. It was a good thing they recommended this seat cause it was very roomy, especially cause I usually book legroom upgrades when I fly. I'm guessing probably a full 6"" more pitch since MCE seats in exit rows always have about 6"" more seat pitch. Contrary to this seat map, the tray table in this row is not in the armrest but in the seat in front of you, which does not impede the seat width. The seat itself is the same B/E Pinnacle slimline seat that United is using on their newly renovated 737's. The flight itself was kinda bumpy, but still enjoyable from the extra legroom."
15464,"You should note that personal on demand ife is not available on all A-319's with 8F seats. I've been on legacy AA A-319's and they offer personal ife screens at every seat. The redone legacy US-Air A-319 with 8 first class seats that I was on had the same seat layout, power, wifi etc as the original AA planes but they don't offer personal ife screens in coach or first."
15465,"I was in a bulkhead row, labeled Main Cabin Extra.  Overall, a seat and plane to be avoided.  Using this plane for a five hour flight from YYZ to LAX is abusive.  My seat was thinly padded and uncomfortable with the first class curtain slapping against my legs throughout the flight.  I also observed others sitting extremely uncomfortably in coach with their 30"" pitch.  Unless you can get rows 9 or 10 in coach, just avoid the plane."
15466,"Took this flight late August 2016. Plane is new and seats thinly padded, with mininal legroom. These seats are the most cramped and uncomfortable of any flight I've taken in many years.  If you must fly on this plane, spend the money for plus seating.  Otherwise, try another plane or airline."
15467,Main cabin extra has noticeably more leg room than economy which starts in row 11.
15468,"I flew on an ex-US Airways A319 from LAX-MCI that had the interior upgraded to this layout.  New leather seats matching the American scheme, but no television in the seat backs.  The seats were the same slimline they are now using without the screens.  MCE is the only way I would get on one of these new Airbus, the other seats are ridiculously tight."
15469,"Comments are accurate, but no TVs ;-( on flights from/to PHL to MSP."
15470,"I am an Executive Platinum customer and typically fly 737s on the LGA-MIA route. This flight was a pleasant surprise. Beautiful new leather seats, each equipped with TVs like you'd see on a A321 or a long-haul 777. Seat had ample legroom. The safety card read ""06/16 REVISION"" so I would believe it if someone told me the plane is brand spanking new. Nice to see American stepping it up, however they need to accelerate their fleet refresh"
15471,"I LOVED THIS SEAT. IF THERE WAS NOT AN ON-DEMAND TV, I WOULD BE BORED."
15472,I loved my seat. My seat was 11A.
15473,"I believe this aircraft is really comfortable, It was a 2 hour flight, the legroom was ok, and the IFE did not bother me at all. Great entertainment options. I love American's newest product, congrats on the new products American!"
15474,"Although I am a Platinum passenger on AA, I had never flown on the A319 before. On the short flight from MIA to ATL my window seat in row 9 was comfortable, similar to the same seat on the A321. You do lose storage space under the seats due to the IFE boxes, which is true in more of the new planes now days."
15475,Be aware of limited storage width due to the electrical box.
15476,"I have flown on this aircraft four times with AA.  Twice is First Class and twice in Coach.  My general comment is to avoid this aircraft it you have any other options.  The seats in First Class should not be considered Business/First Class. They are very uncomfortable and there is not a lot of leg room.  The coach seats are are even worse. They are hard with little leg room.  I am 6'1"" 240.   I could hardly walk after flying on this aircraft.  I would only recommend flying on this aircraft if the flight time is only an hour to an hour and a half."
15477,"I sat in 10F on a flight from PHX-MCI.  Despite this plane being nearly 15 years old, the interior and seat were in great condition.  The window lenses were a bit scratched up, but it didn't affect the ability to see clearly. 

This is a Main Cabin Extra seat, and therefore has significantly more leg room that the standard economy class seat.  I have uploaded pictures to show the leg room.  I am only 5'6"", so leg room typically is not an issue, but I was able to upgrade to MCE for free, so I thought I would try it out."
15478,"The pitch on these seats. Is miserable.  You cannot really open the tray table and the video monitor is about 10 inches away from your face.  If there was ever a ""mainline"" plane to avoid, it is this configuration of American's A319"
15479,"Wow.  I don't believe I have ever flown a jet this uncomfortable.  I am 6'1 and 190 and while the width is OK, the pitch of this seat and the lack of recline are killing me as I am on the plane presently.  I always thought all coach seats were identical so I guess I learned my lesson.  It goes without saying that this is going to be my last trip on this type of equipment."
15480,"What terrible news this is the ""flagship"" or American (if indeed it is).  First Class is OK, but only 8 seats, meaning even Exec Platinums rarely get upgrades.  Coach seats are awful.  Recline is the least I've ever experienced, except for Spirit, which has no recline.   The seats recline about 1 inch.  The backs are thin and hard and shaped wrong...no support.   And there's no IFE!  Only positive comment is Exit Row seats have great legroom.   But that doesn't make the seat comfortable.  Don't, repeat don't book on this plane if you can avoid it...unless you can get into First Class (which BTW is really like Premium Economy)."
15481,"Absolutely the worst aircraft to fly for comfort in economy. I actually thought I was in Main Cabin Extra.  My error.  Nice leather seats with no leg room. From front edge of seat to back of the seat in front of me was less than 12 inches, I measured 10.5 inches.  I am 5'5 and I really felt bad for the men in my row.  Only 8 first class seats if you try to upgrade.  I shall not fly the Airbus 319 again if I can help it."
15482,"Seat is full-width but is missing right-side armrest, which is uncomfortable. (14A is also missing left armrest.)"
15483,"All  negative comments are correct. I had 4 segments on this ""new"" airbus 319, 1 in ""first"" and 3 in coach. First is comparable to premium economy in better INT carriers like Cathay, but legroom is fair. However in coach/cattle class the seats are the worst I've ever experienced (even worse then Spirit airlines if that is possible). I am 6'1 185lbs and I sat Aisle, middle and window and all were terrible - window being the worst, most narrow and the electical box in front. Even on a 1.5 hour flight my back and knees were sore and many others in the flight were complaining of the same problems. This is 3 steps backward for passenger comfort, whoever green-lit this  design should lose their employment at AA. If the fares were 75% discounted to similar routes, I could understand but they aren't."
15484,"BOS-DCA. As long-time Plat, I reserved 11d thinking it was MCE.  Turns out there are only 3 rows of MCE (8, 19, 10), and the 1st one is bulkhead (= less leg room). I was one of the few who actually liked USAir; now I really miss it."
15485,Flew this DSM to PHX. Not the regular equipment for this segment. No entertainment system - space where the screen goes is extra storage. AC power between each seat. Plenty of leg room in MCE.
15486,"I read the scathing comments on this plane before my ATL -> LAX trip and was seriously dreading it based on the negativity.  However, I was pleasantly surprised - the IFE boxes below the seats were not as intrusive as I was expecting based on the reviews, so I had plenty of legroom (note: I'm 5'5"").  And my son was able to play on his laptop without feeling like it was in his face sitting on the tray table.  Our row did not recline due to being directly in front of the exit row, but it wasn't bad.  All in all, a much better flight than I anticipated.  Crew were extremely friendly to boot."
15487,"Forget about limited recline, the seat DOES NOT recline. Between the lack of storage under the seat for row 1 and the lack of recline in row 2, this aircraft should not advertise this a a first class cabin"
15488,"I have traveled on this aircraft from MIA to IAH. No problem with the legroom because i'm short (1,60 m), would liked more recline. It haves some free entertaiment options or premium for purchase. New seat, confortable. In fact, a good experience."
15489,The IFE screen is nearly in your face when the row ahead is reclined. This is an extremely uncomfortable aircraft unless in F or MCE.
15490,"14A is an very good exit row/Main Cabin Extra seat with a seat pitch in excess of the other MCE seats and more legroom than 1st class on the LUS A319 layout (which I flew on my outbound leg). This new layout thankfully has power outlets (only 2 per row though).  I couldn't find the USB outlets though.  The leg room is a little cramped in 14A (and all economy window seats I believe) due to presence of a small electrical box which makes storing a larger bad underneath the seat problematic.  If you want maximum under seat storage space and lots of leg room, take the exit row middle seat.  Overall seat comfort of these new ""slim line"" seats isn't great for a long distance trip (mine was 4.5 hrs) but should be fine for less and 2 hours."
15491,"Very comfortable bulkhead seat.  Unfortunately there are no ""feet cut outs"" so your toes are against the wall.  On my flight my entertainment did not work but the person next to me had no problem.  At least the maps worked."
15492,"This is the first row of economy. Our party of 6 reserved it. I find that it's in the best location of the cabin. There is lots of space, however the legroom is just a tiny bit less than in the other MCE seats behind this row. I'm 5 foot 7 inches, I could stretch my feet out with no problem and I could get out without the other people in this row gettin gout of their seats. Of course absoutely fantastic service on American and they did a great job with the IFE and power!"
15493,I was just on a version of this plane with this seat layout (8 first class seats) and no AVOD. It looks like that is how they are refreshing the ex-US Airways A319s
15494,"I'm only 5'6"" tall and felt really crammed in this seat. There is very little space between your seat and the one in front of you. The electronics boxes also cut down on the space underneath the seat in front of you. I really had to do a contortion act to get my things into and out of this space.

I've flown on A319s previously with other airlines and not had these issues. This is pretty ridiculous. I can't recommend this plane to anyone. Avoid it if you can."
15495,Wow...avoid if at all possible.  This aircraft is a great example of the current state of flying in the US.  Cram as much on the plane as possible regardless of passenger comfort. Just horrible.
15496,"The seat width of 17.7"" is like a straitjacket, even with the extra legroom in MCE.  It's intolerable for a 4 hr. plus international flight (DFW to Panama City).  Also, the seats and backs are thinly padded, less comfortable than the 1 hour Embraer commuter flight on Copa from PTY to David City.  I won't fly on an A319 again."
15497,Seats 25A and 25B both have boxes under the seat in front of them reducing legroom.
15498,"I am 6'4'' and was not able to sit in this seat without pain for the duration of the flight. Absolutely no leg room. Additionally, electronic charger outlet is placed exactly where your right knee hits the front seat. Worst airplane I have been on - avoid at all cost!"
15499,This seat along with 22f should be marked as less desirable.  It has a box in the leg room area that consumes about 6 inches of the available horizontal space.  I think this is for the ife. I wish i had known this when selecting seats.
15500,"The IFE box really kills what little under seat storage there is. That and the seat pitch is nothing (even as a ""preferred"") that im glad it was only a 45 min flight. Any longer.... oh boy."
15501,"Dreadful - worst flight in a decade. Putting video boxes under seats was stupid 15 years ago. These days it's insanity.

Nowhere to put my legs, nowhere to put my bag, seat in from straight in my face. Will avoid at all costs in the future."
15502,Exit Row 14D ONLY seat (14C/D) worth sitting on in this tin box. Unlimited legroom...much better than restrictive first class bulkhead. As for the plane...announcements were unintelligble with static (FAA violation?). Thank you to AA attendants to make this flight tolerable despite the equipment.
15503,"I do not agree this is a standard MCE seat.  MCE feels noticeably smaller on this aircraft.  Even before the person in front of me reclined, I could not open my laptop on the tray table.  I was ironically reminded of the AA promotional video wherein the space in front of the woman expands and she opens her laptop.  No way she'd open that laptop on this plane.

The comment about there being only 8 seats in First is also true.  I am Exec Plat and was fourth on the upgrade list (obviously didn't get it).

I will avoid this aircraft in future."
15504,"That ""new plane smell"" AA has been talking about is great, but that ""new plane butt"" is painful.  Don't fly this airplane if you have a choice.  If you don't, bring a pillow to sit on - you're gonna need it."
15505,"All seats should be marked red. These ""new"" for American, European style vinyl seats-look-likes are like tight filled potato bags to sit on. At least BAQ-MIA and v.v. is international leg and have pillow(s)one can shove them under the butt.
Have 30 yrs, 4.5 million miles, life Platnm at AA and these are absolutely the WORST seats I ever landed on AA.
This for 2.5 hr flight. Anything for 3 hrs or more, NO way, No matter what."
15506,"Worst aircraft in the flight, which I try to avoid but getting more difficult.  As an Exec Plat I've never gotten an upgrade and even the Main Cabin Extra seats make me miss the departing MD-80's."
15507,"First off, i flew this plane from Bogota to Dallas on a red eye. You have to PAY for movies, even though it was a 6 HOUR international flight.

Second, seatguru please change every seat in economy to red, unless you are 5 feet tall. At 6 foot, my knees hit the seat in front of me, and forget about sleeping.

I have been Plat for 5 years and this is by far the worst plane I have ever been on."
15508,"These ""first class"" seats in the last row of  First/business don't recline all the way. There is a hard Bulkhead that prevents full recline.  Also seat pitch seems pretty close for a First class.  Not a great setup."
15509,"Cramped, cramped, cramped (I'm 5' 9"") - most uncomfortable plane in the sky - even Spirit comes out ahead of this #aafailure. The IFE box takes away the ability to store your 'personal item'. I wear reading glasses and couldn't read anything on the IFE - too far away without glasses and had to lean way forward to try to read with them. What idiots designed this cabin? AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
15510,"Switch flights or pay for premium seating in the Main ""Extra"" seats. Economy seating is ridiculously confining. Find a CRJ to fly on."
15511,"I am a Gold/Platinum status flyer since 2004.  This was the most cramped leg room I have ever experienced on a flight.  Even the small CRJs have more leg room.  My knees were crammed into the seat in front of me and I'm only 5'7"". The US Airways configuration for this plane is roomy compared to this crazy configuration.  I suggest avoiding this plane all together. I am not impressed with this plane. I would happily give up the entertainment to have pain-free knees!!"
15512,"At 6'6"" we paid to ensure we could get exit row seating (AA Gold get half off) and I can't imagine flying in the other sardinelike seating.

A tall person will find it impossible to sleep or even sit fully back in the short-backed seats. The headrest has limited adjustments but even on this very new plane they would already fall right back down the moment you no longer apply pressure.   Leg room in the exit row is plentiful, fortunately.

This plane only has two restrooms for coach, all the way in the back, to service 100 pax.  The lav in first class, which services all of eight people, is guarded to keep the riff-raff out.   There's very little room back there to stand and the crew don't like you invading their space, and do their darndest to stay back there as long as possible.

The entertainment system is basically useless because you have to pay for almost anything offered (and bring your earbuds or pay another $5 for those).  Onboard wifi is also ridiculously expensive at over $20 for the flight.  Guy next to me used his cell phone for his wireless, which I think is still against the rules.

There is no doubt the design of this interior is more about the Benjamins than the customer.   I miss my old MD-80s.   With only 8 seats in first, you can forget about scoring an upgrade unless you're Exec Plat, too (not that it was easy otherwise before)."
15513,"I agree with others' comments about the seating discomfort on this plane, and would add that the ""entertainment unit"" storage subtracts foot room on all seats, including aisle seats.  Even the ""main cabin extra"" seat that I had (which did not recline, due to mechanical error).  Compared to the soon to be departed MD80s, these seats are narrower, and have 1"" less legroom in main economy and 1""-3"" less legroom in main cabin extra.  Too bad these are the ""new standard."""
15514,"My wife and I flew from Miami to Belize on 7/14 and were sitting in seats 2D & 2F. For what are essentially domestic first class seats we found these seats to be very comfortable and the whole flight experience to be very good. The IFE is very similar to the one found in the new 777-300ER, which is a great system. We had friends in 9D & 9F and they also had no complaints about the seats in MCE. I would be happy to fly this plane on pretty much any domestic route."
15515,This plane makes me miss the MD-80!!!!  By far the worse plane I have ever been on except perhaps the old ATR prop plane.  I have been Plat/Exec Plat for over a decade and have flown on every plane AA has put in the air over that period.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
15516,"The interior is very beutiful. The seats have good leg room. The seats are a little stiff, but overall you have godd IFE (in-flight intertainment) and is a very quiet aircraft versus a 757. I would give American a 7/10."
15517,"Every seat on this plane should be yellow or red.  The 'entertainment system' in the backs of the seats place the seat back about 8"" from your face, and God forbid the person in front of you reclines. I will walk before I fly on one of these again."
15518,"I couldn't believe how uncomfortable these seats are. We live in Cayman and fly to Miami via AA 5+ times per year but this was our first flight on this new plane and we will do everything we can to avoid a repeat in the future. I was in a window and there wasn't enough room to store my purse with the box there, nonetheless my legs. I'm 5'9"" and my husband, who was in the middle, is 6', and we were both miserable on this flight. We both have had back surgery, and sitting feeling like you're pitched forward with zero lumbar or cushion support is awful even for a short flight. I cannot imagine flying long haul on it, but I would pay double for another airline with better seats. It's sad because we generally like AA even though most don't, but this plane (even for a 1 hour flight) is just ridiculously bad. Luckily no one reclined into me, but if they had I probably would have come close to a panic attack because it was already way too tight in the seat. Skip this plane if at all possible, especially if your flight is lengthy."
15519,"If you are taller than 5' 10"" or have an inseam longer than 30 this is without a doubt the most uncomfortable seat you could find. The headrest would not stay up, recline was limited and the window seat is noticeably several inches thinner than the middle or aisle seats.  Add the entertainment box crammed under there and you have discomfort awaiting.  Had to wiggle in sideways or press my knees against the seat in front of me (until they reclined..."
15520,Flew on this plane from Dallas to Lubbock yesterday 3/30/15.  Sat in 2F not a very comfortable seat.  I would not fly on this type of plane on a flight longer than 1 hour.  Seat was miserable seat cushion paper thin.  Service was good and entertainment screen was fine with many options. MD-80's much more comfortable.
15521,"On winter 2013-2014, I flew BOG-DFW-ORD and return... I thought this AA's improvement was going to satisfy me, but no! This plane was extremely uncomfortable for a 5+ hr overnight flight. Seats are narrow, the plane feels really cramped, I couldn't even stretch my legs (I'm 6 ft tall)... Besides that, the returning flight was delayed for more than 15 hours at DFW, and flying this plane after waiting that time was like a nightmare (For this leg, I decided to pay more to travel on Main Cabin Extra, and at least I could stretch my legs)... I found out MD 80's domestic-used planes were more comfortable than A319 ones... Despite the fact that DFW airport is really easy to navigate for international passengers, I'll try to avoid this plane  overall the next time I travel to the US

Suggestion: If you can't avoid flying this plane, don't choose a window seat! Instead of that, choose an aisle one, even if you have to pay more for that..."
15522,All Rows have entertainment boxes beneath the seats. Armrests are movable although the lever is small and a little hard to operate.
15523,"As another has mentioned, the seat is itself is fine. It is no different than the ones Delta and United are using to reconfigure in there economy section. It is the placement of the entertainment box in the window and middle seats that forces you to angle your feet in order to maximize your legroom. My advice is to pick the aisle seat (pay extra if you have to). I am 5'10 and no, my knees were not touching the seat in front of me."
15524,"Without a doubt the tightest, smallest, least comfortable seat since the days of Airtran. This is progress? That this is AA's new flagship is a joke.  Who was in charge of stategy, the Munchkins?

Two flights on UA instead in nonstop on this turkey is a no brainer.  Its hard to imagine a corporate management so clueless....of course they go First"
15525,"Good legroom, universal power port, quiet flight, comfy seat, my TV worked, the seats next to mine's TVs didn't work, jerky flight attendants."
15526,"The new chair are not the issue, is the HUGE box on the floor that is not aligned with the chair.  This makes it rub into your leg the entire flight.  it's actually worst on the window seat."
15527,"Absolutely the most uncomfortable plane ride in years. Even worse than the European budget airlines. Claustrophobic and I was on the aisle! I could not get my small water in the seat pocket, had to fold my tray table down to get the safety instructions out of the plastic back of the seat in from of me! Impossible to juggle a sandwhich and a drink at the same time. Elite moving back to SWA."
15528,"All baffiling has been beaten out of this ancient flying nightmare. It leaves ORD to EWR. Its freezing onboard and ""too old to keep steady heat,"" low 60s, mid 50s overnight... that cute blanket ... grab that and another or your jacket, and forget about sleeping..."
15529,"The interference in leg room from the entertainment power units must not be taken lightly.. For anyone over about 5'5"" this is a big discomfort.. I will avoid in future. Sure would like to know how this type of connfiguration gets this far down the road.. Not well researched/ tested"
15530,"Again, all the comments about this plane are accurate.  I was in a standard coach seat and was watching the video screen.  When the passenger in front of me reclined, the screen was so close I could not focus on it.  I ended up just turning it off.  And of course there was no where near enough room for a laptop. I'm Exec Plat with AA so obviously I'm on many of their planes.  This was the most miserable by far.  Now when I fly DFW YYZ, I connect in ORD or LGA just to avoid this plane. My most recent ticket was about $100 more than the non-stop but I willingly paid it."
15531,"LAX-DFW-BOG return and worst flights ever. Pitch is stupidly small.  I'm 6 3 and even before I tried to recline I could only just get my shins under the bottom of the seat in front.  Recline is a couple of inches and the seat tilts up and there goes any thought of legs extending. To avoid jamming my knees against the reclined seat in front I end up sitting sideways. For 5 hours.
I aould go out of my way to avoid the A319 as flown by AA."
15532,"AA got this plane layout totally wrong - I purchased a First Class seat and while the FE screen was nice the seat pitch is less than the old MD80. I flew another flight in coach and thankfully only a 2 hour flight - horrible seats. It is a sad fact that I prefer the old MD80 to this aircraft - shame on AA for putting out this as an ""improvement"". The MD80 has a first class to economy ratio of @1-8 giving a FF a chance of an upgrade. The ""new and improved"" A319 has a ratio of @1-14 nearly twice as bad. I will avoid this aircraft at all costs"
15533,These seats are miserable as the entertainment boxes take up so much of the leg room as to be nonexistent if you put your purse below. The box for the window seats take up so much room that you sit at an angle and there is no room for even a medium sized purse. Shame on you American Airlines for thinking this is great customer service. I would like all of the AA executives to fly in these miserable seats.
15534,I agree. Avoid this airplane. Seats to close and uncomfortable. My back hurt throughout the flight.
15535,"I was honestly excited to hear AA was adding the Airbus to their fleet.  That excitement was short lived.  This is honestly the WORST airplane I've ever been on.   The seating configuration is terrible, the seats are uncomfortable, there is no space in the seat back pocket to even place a bottle of water.  It's sad that I prefer the old MD80 to the 319.  AVOID this aircraft at all costs."
15536,Leg room is very restricted. Seat cushion is inexistent and the seat barely reclines. Lots of traffic to bathrooms during red-eye flight make nearly impossible to sleep.
15537,"All first class seats should be marked at least yellow.  The recline is terrible in both rows.  In row 1 the bulkhead is so close that I could come nowhere close to stretching out my legs (average height male).  If you are a corporate travel professional, demand AA grant lower rates for these seats they are not ""first class"" by any measure."
15538,"This was a First Class seat.  In this new Premium Cabin environment, the seat backs are lower and narrower, so every word the passengers in front of or behind you say interrupts your thoughts, concentration and/or conversation with the person sitting next to you.  A case in point is that the passenger in front of me has shaken the ice in his scotch THE ENTIRE FLIGHT and I've HEARD it THE ENTIRE FLIGHT.  The tray tables are too small and sit too close to your body.  The seat in front of you lays back into your space.  My laptop could not be opened fully when the seat in front of me was reclined.  There's only a thin wall between First and Coach which is not even sealed off at the walls, so the light from the window behind in Coach comes through, interfering with the video screen in the seat back in front of me and there is little physical barricade to the noise from the first row in Coach (considerable on my particular flight).  The lack of storage for the in-flight blanket meant it either ended up on the floor or under my arm.  As much as AA needed to upgrade it's equipment and replace its S80s, this was a poorly thought out aircraft from the passenger's perspective.  It's nice to have seat back enterrainment, but other than that and the ""new car smell"", this is a very uncomfortable and cramped aircraft and whenever possible I avoid flyingit."
15539,"Just flew back from Bogata,CO..business class..all nighter.this seat is terrible..doesnt relcone at all..the seats on this plane ""slide"" forward..impossible to sleep. The whole First Class cabin only has 8 seats..very small and cramped. Fine for a daytime short haul...HORRIBLE for a LONG haul..."
15540,"Every single one of the reviews here is dead on accurate.  American must have consulted Ryanair before they configured the seats here.  30"" seat pitch is ridiculous.   The curvature of the seats does absolutely allow for more cattle to be placed in steerage but I can't hardly even see my laptop as I write this review based on how I have to have it cranked.  The plane itself is new and quiet but that's about it.  Avoid this at all costs unless you're in 1st or an exit row.  I'd fly a 15 year old ERJ-135 before I'd fly this again."
15541,"I had the misfortune of flying an A319 from Dallas to Huntsville.  The seats have been reconfigured to thin the lower portion of the seat in front, to allow your seat to be jammed even closer.  The seat pocket and tray table have been moved up, consuming the volume in front of your face.  You are so close to the seat in front of you that you cannot hold or read a magazine.  The lower corner of the seat in front is so low that you cannot put your feet under the seat without bruising your chins, if there were even space to do it, as that volume has been used up by the entertainment equipment, of which 2 of the 3 on my row did not work.  (The privacy screen prevents knowing how many others did not work)  The tray table is double hinged because there is not sufficient room for it.  The plane is so claustrophobic that people are having panic attacks in it.  Watch the news.  I am 6 ft, 190 lbs.  I travel for business and had to buy a first class upgrade, out of pocket, for the return flight.  Never again will I fly an AA A319. I complained to AA and was told this is their Flagship!!!"
15542,Excellent business class product at a reasonable price.  Seat is comfortable and lots of room too.  I'm a larger guy so the only complaint is that the fold out table doesn't push out far enough to accommodate me.
15543,These seats have virtually no storage in the seat back pocket and if you stow anything under the seat you will have no legroom.  The seats are so close together that it is very difficult to access anything under the seats if the seat ahead is reclined.
15544,"Flew in MCE from DFW to Bogota.  As someone who usually sits in front, but this time sat in back as I had my kids, I found the seat extremely comfortable, with decent leg room and great entertainment.  I'd take this over a S80 any day of the week.  Kids loved the shows and games and we had excellent service for a long (5 1/2 hour) flight.  Overall - very satisfied with the new A319 -- great aircraft!"
15545,"I try to avoid the 319 as much as I can although as they retire the MD80's it will become more difficult to do so. I am average height - 5'9"" and sitting in 14A was the most uncomfortable I have been in years. The window exit actually curves into your space slightly as well as having the curvature of the cabin reduce your shoulder and head room. I was sat next to a big guy who was miserable and who could not help but have his shoulders against mine, consequently I spent 2.5 hours crammed up against the wall.
I am an Executive Platinum and I will go out of my way to avoid this equipment."
15546,"I've flown a lot of Airbus equipment before, including the A319, and have found them comfortable enough.  But that was before my first trip on an AA configured A319.  The arm rests cannot be raised on any economy aisle/window seats in the plane.  Most airlines give some flexibility to relieve crowding by raising an arm rest.  But not this monstrosity.  Ditto to the comments of other guru's regarding narrowness and tightness of seats in the back."
15547,Exit row seats are reasonably comfortable compared to other economy seats. Actually had room to cross my legs. Not as claustrophobic as the rest of economy. On a later flight I sat in 14C and noticed it was not as wide as 14A since exit row seats have non-moveable armrests. I normally like the aisle but will choose exit row window seats on this aircraft. I did like having both AC & USB power at every seat.
15548,"I was very disappointed in overall cabin configuration for the following reasons:  

1. In typical Airbus fashion the entertainment system occupies significant space under seats A, B, E, and F. This prevented underseat storage of my small computer bag which fits fine elsewhere, even Regional Jets. This necessitated storage in the overhead bin.  Multiply this by the number of pax in similar situation and it places great and unnecessary demands on overhead storage.  Furthermore, the configuration resulted in very tight and uncomfortable legroom with my right leg frequently pressing uncomfortably against the metal box under the seat.

2.  The pitch between seats was too small, I'm 6ft 1in and my knees were pressing against the seat most of the flight.  My face was barely 15 inches from the seat in front of me.  Also, seat cushions are too thin.  

3.  The entertainment system didn't work (reported to cabin staff) - why even have it on aircraft operating short domestic flights?  Remove it and retrieve under seat space, reduce weight and maintenance costs.

4. Only 1 overwing emergency exit? While it may pass FAA evacuation tests, I question whether it will be effective with panicky pax unfamiliar with emergency procedures as well as cluttered and tight seat rows."
15549,"Probably the worst seat on the worst airline I've ever ridden.  Absolutely no room.  Tray table the size of a business letter envelope.  No way to use a notebook or read or do anything else but watch video.
Zero room for feet or any small item under seat. (Not that you could reach down there anyway).  Video screen and magazine rack directly in front of your face.  I'll find another carrier or drive before getting on another of those disgusting birds."
15550,"The Airbus 319A is an absolute joke.  I am 6'2"", 175 lbs. and I have never been more uncomfortable on an airplane in my life. I could not put my legs under the seat in front of me. In fact, it wasn't even close. The seats are so close together that when I tried to extend my legs, my shins hit the bottom of the seat in front of me.  Not that there was any room for them under the seat anyway given the ""entertainment box.""  What kind of an idiot designs a plane with a box located under the seat?  When the person in front of me reclined, I nearly came unglued. I literally felt like seat back was 8"" from my face.  As I was sitting there, I kept asking myself whether anyone from AA actually sat in the coach section before they decided to purchase/lease the 319A. The sad thing is I know they did--and that they just don't care at all about the comfort of their customers.  I will do my best to never fly AA again.  EVER."
15551,"Extremely limited recline, tray table is very tight - does not push away from the body as it does on the MD80, though the bulkhead is not particularly close or restrictive (and I'm 6'3). Personal video screen is nice but controls not intuitive and wired remote that nests in the armrest gets tangled."
15552,"Video equipment under seats reduces the under-seat space significantly in terms of width.  In the window seat I was in, it was further reduced by the curvature of the aircraft cutting in.  30"" of seat pitch is awfully tight, even by the latest standards.  The plane is wonderful and new, but they've got you crammed in so tight, it would be hard for me to imagine being crammed in here for longer than the 1 hour flight I was on.

The tray tables are very shallow, impossible to put a laptop on them of any decent size.  I'm 5'5"" tall and I felt cramped.  Other airlines A319's are far easier to handle."
15553,Explat flyer lucky enough to get a seat upfront but the seat pitch was laughable and only 4 seats. Come on AA you know this config is your bread and butter business flight yet only two rows for your best customers.  Shame shame.  But thank goodness we have choices.  theres no reason to fly AA if your loyalty is based on getting upgraded with only two rows your chances just went from remote  to very very remote.
15554,"This was the worst seating experience since flying AirTran years ago. I literally could not fully open my laptop with the seat in front ""upright"". Even the seat back pocket is so small, you can't fit a hardback book in it. First class has fewer seats, so good luck getting an upgrade if you aren't Exec Plat. Avoid this equipment at all costs."
15555,"Without question, the most uncomfortable coach seat I've ever been in. I couldn't even get my feet under the seat in front of me for a little relief, because the bottom of the seat was so close it hit me in the middle of my shin.

The shape of the seat allows them to cram the rows tighter together while technically leaving the pitch unchanged, but the reality is that it's the tightest coach I've ever been in. Even United's standard economy isn't this bad.

Unless you're in first class, avoid this aircraft at all costs.  The MD-80 I came in on was much, much more comfortable."
15556,"Unbelievably cramped.  I'm just over 6 feet tall and it is the most uncomfortable seat I've been in - and that's before the seat in front of you is reclined.  If that happens the amount of space you are left with is comical.  The video screen doesn't tilt to accommodate the fact that, with the seat in front reclined, the line of sight is almost below your chin.  When designing the seating layout of this craft there was only one priority: revenue generation."
15557,"Tray tables are more narrow on this new plane than older planes. Can't fit a laptop and a drink. Seat pockets won't hold a drink either. Row 11 is first row that is NOT Main Cabin Extra, and it has very little room for a laptop between new seat back screens and less legroom."
15558,I have never been more cramped on an airplane than on this one.  Extremely uncomfortable.  I will avoid this plane at all cost in the future- even never flying American again.
15559,I’ve flown on boeing all my life until this month. Found the airbus a bit more comfortable and the engines were quite impressive. Always prefer window but aisle seat was ok. Beware of try service as I was bumped slight a couple of times.
15560,"If you'd like a view of the flaps and trailing edge of the wing, pick row 19."
15561,"A320 06/18 Revision per Safety Information Card had Power at this row of seats (one USB and one multi-plug type just below knee level for each seat, no shared plug), which were Regular Economy.  Still no TV."
15562,"I felt this seat was extremely roomy. I had great leg room and am 5'9"" tall and above average in weight. Did not feel cramped in the least bit. Put a bag under seat in front of me as well."
15563,These are regular economy seats but these A320s seem more to have more leg room than the 737s.
15564,Not impressed with legroom for this first class seat from PHL-FLL. (Photo with orange bag shows my leg leaning toward left)
15565,"In the exit rows the tray table is installed in a fixed armrest, therefore, seat width is slightly reduced."
15566,"Seat was fine, minimal leg room but not cramped on aisle seat.  Cramped with passengers beside me.  No internet service or entertainment on this flight - AA should have this for a 3 hour flight.  AA should not have 60 min connection times for international flights, and have them on the other side of the airport.  Luggage took way too long, and had to abandon it and run to make my connection.  In Toronto, AA found my bag next day, kudos."
15567,ok so i was flying from phl-pbi ok so the seat i sat in was comfortable i just had something to say i did not like my experience ok so american said ok flights on time we got on the aircraft oh there is a storm 15-30 min then a another 15-30 min then a second storm we were on the plane at the gate for 2 hours i hate that then due medical reasons they could could not brink the cart down how lovely is that they only served warm water and the flight was longer then usual not counting that awful delay hope to never fly you again also on the flight obi-phl it was just delayed 3 hours no big deal come on american step up your game cause I'm pretty sure on pho-pbi they knew about the storm just that want to be mean they're were also crying babies so loud it so annoying waiting for 2 hours on a plane with crying babies is terrible p.s. never flying american again
15568,"Standard Domestic first Class.  No meal on 1h45m OAK-PHX, just snacks/drinks - all I need at 6AM.  Service totally depends on attitude of the attendants.  Today: friendly and helpful (on my connection:  Gina grumpy-pants)  A decent deal for the price."
15569,Wall rib is right in my shoulder.
15570,I had no problems with this seat.  Flew at night so really couldn't see out much.  Very comfortable. leg room was fine.  Flight was only just an hour and half flight.
15571,"Seats are much more comfortable than AA 737 seats. Would highly recommend seeking the a320 over the 737. 

Overall not bad but not great. It gets the job done."
15572,"I flew round trip from DCA-MCO on late afternoon/evening flights and found this seat to be pretty good, but there were a couple things that may have bothered other people, that weren't an issue for me. First, since I'm only 5'3, legroom isn't an issue for me, but even when I stretched out my legs I didn't feel cramped. Second and probably the main reason was that it was only a 2 hour flight. Since the flight was so short, neither me nor the person in front of me reclined. I didn't mind a lack of a  USB or AC power outlet, though I probably would've on a longer flight. Service was typical for a 2 hour flight, as the FA's came around once for pretzels and drinks. The seat was wide enough and I would highly recommend this row for window lovers, as this row sports two windows. Overall, this was a good seat for a short flight, but I might consider upgrading to main cabin extra on a 4-5 hour flight."
15573,The seats must have gotten a new upholstering. They are pretty comfortable.
15574,"Ridiculously small & little legroom for first class.  No IFE or Power ports - and it was a newer plane - why does AA fly this junk?  Offered streaming to personal devices in Y, but no one's feed worked, so little bandwidth."
15575,"None of the seats on this aircraft, first class or coach, has power outlets. Beware if you're expecting to be able to recharge your device once on board."
15576,"The seat was very cramped and I would have prefered to fly in 11D. Or the four aisle seats in the second exit row. However, the view from the seat was amazing. If you like taking pictures 14A has a great view of the wing and air."
15577,Flew economy Philadelphia-Las Vegas on a newly refurbished A320. What a difference ia refurb makes! The seats felt and smelled fresh in the smart AA dark grey upholstery. I'm 6'2 and there was plenty of room for my long legs when sitting. I had a real treat though as the flight was barely half full so all 3 seats to myself meaning I could lie across them and sleep for over 4 hours! There's still no IFE even after the refurb but wifi is available to buy on board. Complementary non-alcoholic drinks were offered and snacks available for purchase.
15578,"Comfortable plane with good legroom. Only complaint is no IFE but other than that, good flight."
15579,"While this A320 still has the original US Airways interior, it is more than satisfactory for a short 2 hour flight. Flying from PHX-SMF, I could have chosen to fly Southwest, but not only was the American fare actually cheaper at the time, but the seats are much more desirable. No IFE or power outlets, but these amenities really aren't all that important on shorter flights. The wi-fi at least tells me the time to destination, which is really all I need."
15580,"Seats behind the rere emergency seats on American Airlines A330-200 should be flagged as the emergency seats are used as a crew rest area with the seat backs pushed back for duration of flight and area curtained off making it a bit claustrophobic in seats 24A, 24B, 24G and 24H."
15581,"We did not find the seat headrests to be comfortable at all.
They were at a very uncomfortable height and angle for both my husband (6'2"") and I myself at 5'5"". In addition there wasn't any inflight entertainment available...no screens for movies! Very unusual on a 6 hour flight!"
15582,"Seat Legroom:  I am only 5'6"", so leg room was not an issue.  I had no problem getting my personal carry-on item between my seat cushion and the seat back of the seat in front of me, and under the seat in front of me.    
Seat Recline:  I did not use the reclining feature, the flight was too short for that to matter.  
Seat Width:  I found the seat width to be comfortable for my slightly above average frame.  
This seat had one window, positioned slightly forward of my shoulder when I sat back in the seat.  The fuselage panels did not obstruct movement or make leaning against the wall uncomfortable."
15583,"Flew this red-eye flight from SEA-CLT; flighttime of 4h15. As with other ex-US Airways aircraft, the seats are a bit older but still comfortable and pitch is adequate. There isn't much recline on a standard economy seat- don't expect to get much sleep, but comfort and space-wise, it is fine for a multi-hour trip. No IFE or power, but apparently streaming vidéo is possible via the Wifi for a fee."
15584,"Flew from CLT->SJO. This plane was an A320neo, and so it was VERY new, delivered maybe March 2016. Snack and drink cart came by twice on this four-hour flight, which is acceptable, but everything good is gone when they get to the back of the plane. SeatGuru says that they had 31 inch seat pitch but it seemed like a lot less. Good thing I am short so I had an alright flight. 22F had one full window and another one between 22F and 21F. Overall, well done American!"
15585,"Flew this plane on US Airways, very comfortable unlike Delta."
15586,"7F is a standard economy seat. Nothing special. If you want WIFI, buy the day pass for $16 BEFORE you go up in the air. Once airborne, AA wanted $40 for a one day pass on a flight from PHX to DCA. Always cheaper on the ground."
15587,Nice legroom and good recline
15588,Flew DEN to PHX.  This seat was tolerable for the 1.5 hour flight only due to the fact that the person in front of me did not recline her seat.  Very cramped feeling due to the tight seat pitch.  This aircraft was still in U.S. Air livery.  We can hope that American will add MCE seating.
15589,"This seat is really tight. I had a tall man next to me and the 5 hour flight was really hard. Very uncomfortable and very crammed seat. I am only 5'8"" male at 180 lbs and I was REALLY crammed on this seat"
15590,Worst Airline ever!  Row 4 first class seats do not recline.  They are fixed at upright.   What arent they thinking.  Irritating 1/4 of their first class cabin even before takeoff.
15591,"They should call this seat the ""thrombosis"" seat. They call this an exit row - it is NOT except for the window seat, which has no seat in front of it. The other two are unbearable - especially ""B"". I am an average size woman. The person in front of me leaned back and I could not fully open my tray table - it is hinged- and I had to hold my book up to my face to read. This was the most miserable 3 hours of my life."
15592,There was a metal box under the seat in front which reduced storage space. (I think most economy seats have this problem.
15593,This seat or region of the plane gets very hot. The crew was aware and said this whole area of the aircraft gets less circulation than the rest
15594,"Overhead bin over starboard row 11 exit has limited storage due to equipment. Can fit coat or small bag, no luggage.  Overhead bin over starboard row 13 houses life raft and does not allow stowage."
15595,Main cabin  extra seat lots of leg room even with seat infront of me reclined.  Decent space for feet despite IFE box. Overall very comfortable.
15596,"This airplane seat has 2 inches more pitch than layout 2 and it made a difference.  I was able to cross my legs with no problem.  It was only a snack flight (2.5 hrs) and the cheese tray was excellent.  We also got warmed nuts.  They serve Woodford Reserve bourbon, so I was happy."
15597,"There is a window, but it is in the forward half of the space, which does not allow the passenger to lean into it, thus reducing the shoulder width by several inches. I choose the window for those extra inches."
15598,"Seat 11D and 11E have underseat storage under row 10. Seats 11 A-C do not due to a large device blocking access to row 10.  There is a small space for 11C but not much. Having flown this plane before the width's of the seats are definitely narrower than the other rows but I'm 5'11"" and 220 lbs and I fit ok.  The video monitor is on a swing arm and a little clunky and the tray tables come out of the arm rest.   Legroom is very spacious and I couldn't even reach my bag under row 10 without getting up.  11D, E and 12F are the best seats on this plane."
15599,Plenty of legroom but the proximity to the restroom and the large amount of space between rows 23 and 24 make it too tempting for anyone waiting for the restroom to take over that space as the default waiting area.  It's like friggin' Grand Central Station!
15600,"I'm an average sized man at 5'10"" and 195 pounds and found this seat to be extremely uncomfortable with minimal legroom and foot room (due to power box) taking up 1/2 the space in front of me.   The in flight entertainment unit was nice but did not make up for lack of space."
15601,"Overhead bins reserved for First Class. No other storage for your bag, so you are forced to put it farther back in the plane, even in Boarding Group 3."
15602,"Pros: You'll have legroom for miles, and the space is also easier to stand up/move around in. 
Cons: It's one of the narrower seats I have encountered on a plane. I don't know if that's the way all the seats in the aisle are; my partner was in 11A and he did not comment on it. Both the media screen and the tray fold out of some portion of the armrest and using both together feels so awkward. There is no under-seat storage because there is a large box that covers your seat and extends halfway across 11A and 11C.11A and 11C do both have under-seat storage, if truncated.  There's also no direct overhead storage so you'll have to just find a spot in one of the other overhead bins and grab it before someone else does. The FA did help with this on our flight and even entering in Group 9, we were able to find spaces.
Other Notes: The media screen folds out from between the seats and is easy to use, once you've figured out where the button release is (it's on the side of your armrest). 11A has a good view out the window."
15603,"No overhead space due to Emergency equipment storage.   Also, the below seat space in front is limited due to power boxes."
15604,"On the A321 (ver 1), seats 24B and 24 E are substantially narrower that a typical seat, making this uncomfortable unless you are a small person.  The leg room is nice, but it is also located near a labatory, so cwords can encroach on your space.  I would NOT recommend this seat."
15605,"Simply dreadful.  Hardly what one expects forward in the cabin. Barely any recline / only just slightly more than economy. 
The food was..., well, inedible - unless you're truly hungry. No USB ports, no electrical sockets of any sort - whatsoever, and no IFE - unless you're using your own device [which you can't re-charge].
American's product sure has declined."
15606,"I recently flew this aircraft up from Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic to Charlotte, North Carolina in seat A1 and can only say that this was hardly a 'first-class' seat and/or experience. The seat has virtually no greater pitch [38] than 'Main cabin extra' [35-36], though 1st does have 3 more inches of width [unless you're in a bullhead seat where the tray-table is stowed in the arm-rest, as in row 1]. Additionally, I couldn't fully extend my legs due to the proximity to the bulkhead and, of course, there's no under-seat storage during take-off nor landing.  The heads were the smallest I've ever experienced on a twin-engine commercial flight -  I mean tiny! If you're adult-sized - don't plan on their viability. Finally, OK, this wasn't a prime-/meal-time flight, however PUJ to CLT is a 4 hour [actual flight time - excluding boarding, taxiing, etc] flight and we were only offered chips, pretzels or cookies {with limited beverage options as well} - in '1st' class. Disgraceful. I felt truly sorry for the cabin staff that had to attempt to function in that minute galley. As a 'million-miler', I hate to see AA's product  sink to such a low-level[s]. This is NOT value for money."
15607,The under seat storage is taken up by a power box
15608,"AA lists this as an exit row seat. IT IS NOT! 25A and 25F are hut kit rest in row. They even had the nerve to ask me twice if I was willing and able to assist. And like most AA flights out of MIA, the plane is filthy!"
15609,Box under the seat was annoying and took up lots of room but worth it considering the IFE American has on this plane. Still worth the box because of the entertainment they have. Legroom wasn't great even though we paid extra for Main Cabin Extra. New plane. Alright flight
15610,Exit Row Seat with leg room for days. No under-seat storage available die to aircraft storage unit (A and C seats do have under-seat access)
15611,"Beware...America charges extra but one cannot squeeze one's feet into space under seat in front. Some sort of box for equipment.
Should be coded yellow and shame on America for charging extra for crappy seat (e.g. Footroom)."
15612,"These seats have insufficient air, it was so hot from row 13 to 20 was 15 degrees hotter than the rest of the plane. Flight attendant said there was nothing that could be done. Do not seat in these rows if you want to breath."
15613,Underseat storage for 12D is smaller than for routine aisle seats on this aircraft.  An extra IFE (supporting seat 11D) takes up space at the front.
15614,These are used for the Hawaii flights - Airbus A321S.  I fly these airplane often and really try to avoid them but they are everywhere.  First class seat Row 1 is what you want if you are paying nd can choose.  You have no one in front of you so you have a very relaxing and open area.  You can put your feet on the bulkhead.  Otherwise the pitch is insufficient even in F.
15615,Limited foot room due to some (power?) boxes underneath seat in front.
15616,25D shows as Exit row as 25F has no seat in front of it. 25D has only standard leg room and a normal size backpack will not fit under the seat due to the configuration of the row 24
15617,"V2 of the 321 ORD-LAX and commonly used to DFW and Hawaii.  14F is really tight, no foot space withe the entertainment box - Im 6'2 - but the entire 14DEF row should be yellow. Overwater equipment (and that's most/all aircraft) takes up the overhead bin over these seats, so its a real chafe to get your carry-ons stored. Avoid."
15618,"Flying on this A321S from DFW to Las Vegas.  Row 11 is an exit row.  3 seats as A-B-C on the left, and D-E on the right, with 11F seat taken out.
Row 11 A-E seats all have great leg room, much more than even the first class seats (we flew back on first class 4A & 4B).  However the bag storage space above Row 11 is reserved for airplane emergency equipment.  Because of this, 11D and 11E on the left side becomes more desirable because you can store small bags in the back of row 10, while such space is not quite accessible for 11 A-C."
15619,On the Airbus A321 for Flight 14330 DFW-SFO on 8/16/18 seats 30 E & 30 F each had floor mounted electrical equipment boxes under the seats in front thus reducing width of foot space under the seats in front. Annoying.
15620,"Seat does not recline. Shouldn't be ""green"" or listed as ""good seat"". Maybe mixed review?"
15621,Not a bad seat.
15622,"DFW to LV - There is very little room to stow anything under the seat in front of you.  Seat 19 E appeared to have the same problem.  I'm short so leg room wasn't a problem.

I use a small soft bag as a carry on and usually have no problem stowing it under the seat in front of me.  At first I didn't think it was going to fit but after squishing it a bit I was able to make it work.  There was just enough room left to stow my small purse."
15623,"American seatback entertainment one of the best, except you will get interrupted by AA credit card ad in early portion (cannot be muted).  Main Cabin Extra so we had early boarding group 5 + easy access to overhead & quicker deplaning.  Among first to get served snacks/drinks.  I believe complimentary alcohol for those who's lives are that pathetic they have to drink everywhere.  Seatback screen has a very limited viewing angle so a person to your side cannot really see what you are watching, but anyone behind and near sure can (and vice versa).  MCE worth it for me."
15624,Under seat room narrowed by 4inches due to equipment box.
15625,exit row with unbelievable leg room.  The seats themselves are slightly narrower (if possible) than a normal coach seat.  Tight seat or leg room - your trade off.
15626,This seat has TWO entertainment control boxes under the seat in front.  This leaves less foot space than any other position.   This is a horrible seat for the long footed or those who plan to put anything below.  A std bookbag will not fit.  There is also a raft stored overhead.  This row sucks.
15627,"One of the best seats on the entire plane in my opinion in regards to legroom, hands down.  You do have to share your leg space with the FA during takeoff and landing but that was only about 20 minutes in total.  My only qualms regarding the seat was that the power outlet for this seat is on the floor vs. all of the other seats having their on the seatbacks in front them, and this made it awkward with my seat neighbor.  Also, the monitor which came out of the armrest wouldn't stay locked fully in place, however, these were minor issues for me.  I'm 6'3 and wanted the legroom more than anything and that's exactly what I got.  Made my four hour flight much more enjoyable."
15628,"First of all, this is a new A321S which DOES have electric outlets at each seat (contrary to what a previous commenter said) as well as in-seat entertainment monitors.  The aircraft also features three bathrooms in coach, all of which are large enough for a man to stand up without hunching over.  These are perhaps the largest bathrooms I have ever seen in the coach section of a plane.  This Main Cabin Extra seat was fine...plenty of legroom.  Row 11 would be even better and those exit row seats recline  (Row 12 is not really an exit row even though designated as such.)"
15629,"The seat 33C was near the rear of the plane.  Otherwise, the seat was fine.  Comfortable enough for me at 6'4"" and 275 lbs.  

The IFE made the two and a half hours from Viva Las Vegas to DFW go by pretty fast.

I'd prefer to be more forward but wouldn't pay extra to get out of this seat."
15630,"I would mark this seat RED. The lavatory door opens directly to this seat, a constant parade of fellow travelers with accompanying odors and sounds. Most unpleasant for 6 hour flight..."
15631,"Con: Both 11 D, and 11 E are Sold by AA as Main Cabin Extra, However, due to the tray table & video screen being part of the arm rest these seats are uncomfortably narrow.  The seat does not recline at all, & the seat becomes more uncomfortable as the flight progresses.  The Flight Steward sits in a jump seat,facing the back of the plane,  in the area of the ""missing seat 11 F"". Because your seats are in the middle of a row, you can't lean your head against anything, making any kind of nap very difficult.
Pro: You have the exit aisle in front of your seat, so you have great leg space, but that is it."
15632,"Pros:  (Hint:  This actually *DOES* have under-seat storage space.  In front of the seat, where the missing seat is, is the flight attendant jump seat.  Behind the jump seat is the underneath part of seat 10F; I put my smaller carry-on there without problems.)  Has TONS of leg room.  Window seat, but missing seat in front allows you to get in/out without crawling over other people in row. 
Cons:  The in-flight entertainment is this awful robot-arm-thing that comes from under the seat.  It's awkward to fold/unfold, and can get in the way if you're trying to eat or work on the tray table."
15633,armrests are lower to ground and weak thigh support
15634,"An overnight flight from LAX to MIA.  Picked this seat for the extra 6 inches. Seats in this row (12A - 12C) did not recline. Seat 11C reclined into me, and it was difficult to get up while they reclined."
15635,"DFW TO LAX roundtrip.  Flown this plane first in 25F, then again on A14.  For A14, the overall width of the seat is tight, so moving side to side is impossible.  Leg movement side-to-side is reduced 25% with the installation of a box that controls the seat's electronics.  Picking up anything under the seat in front of you is impossible.  MISERABLE and very uncomfortable experience."
15636,"Just not enough room! Temerature in this section could not be controlled. Way too hot! You cannot retrieve what you drop on the floor, there is not enough room to do so. Very unpleasant experience."
15637,"Flew on this plane from Seattle to Dallas Fort Worth. Seat was really nice with the adjustable head rest but when the seat was fully upright it was extremely uncomfortable, legroom was pretty dismal. IFE bad a decent selection but it forced you to watch two 30 second ads (youtube style) before your movie starts which I hated. Eventually I just switched to the moving map the whole flight. Service was average at most, FAs were nice but didn't seem very interested. Lavatory was directly behind so I heard the toilet flush the whole time but no smell. I say a 7/10"
15638,"The exit row seats (row 11) have tons of legroom and a large overhead bin. The bulkhead seats have the inflight entertainment on the bulkhead in front of each passenger. There are large metal boxes where we place our feet, cutting down on space to put a carryon bag. The seats are narrow, but a few inches more room, which is why we paid extra for the seats. My husband is 64 and he has about 3 inches between his knee and the seat in front of him with the seat up. That would change if the passenger reclined the seat. All the seats in MCE seem to have the same amount of legroom."
15639,First class seats are NOT full recline as shown and Row 1 seats have less leg and footroom than many coach seats.  I was in 1C and it was impossible for me to straighten my legs.  AA should be ashamed of itself for selling this as First Class.
15640,"The extra legroom is nice - im 64 and was able to fully extend without touching the seat in front. And theres under seat storage in front. On the downside, no window (just a tiny port hole) and the storage bin above has emergency equipment on both aides of the aisle, so you cant use it."
15641,"Comfortable for a 3 hr flight. Leg room was fine for Coach. Wi-Fi was OK on my windows laptop, had some issues with iPhone."
15642,"Very little room under the seat in front of you, and the seat seems narrower than most.  My small-ish backpack wont fit. I will avoid this seat and the plane in the future."
15643,Row 36 does not recline at all.
15644,"On the American Airlines site, row 25 is shown as an exit seat.  This is somewhat misleading as these seats except in window have no extra leg room and other regular exon seats AND the seats in front in row 24 recline.  There is a texhnixal reason these are classifies as exit aisle nut avoid unless its 25A or E.  I sat in 25B and it was miserable."
15645,"I paid the fee for Main Cabin Extra for the ""amenities"", but was terribly disappointed. The seats were hard and uncomfortable, and the newer A320s have reduced seat width.  The biggest issue is the media box on the floor attached to the chair legs.  DO NOT get a window seat on this aircraft - I could not even fit my backpack under the seat in front because of the limited under-seat space between curvature of the aircraft wall and media box.  Was a terrible flight."
15646,"These seats are amazing, and pretty much as good as first class, except not as wide, and you don't get the free food and cocktails like first.  I book these seats whenever possible."
15647,"No power outlet, no entertainment on this bird between San Diego, DFW, and back."
15648,"Seat 25A was an premium economy seat with extra leg room because no seat in front.  Kind of weird set up but great for a person with long legs.  

IFA folded up from in front/below the seat.

I would use this seat again in the future."
15649,Seat has standard recline and tight leg space. Do not confuse this seat as a spacious exit row seat because it is not
15650,Seat has standard recline and tight leg space. Do not confuse this seat as a spacious exit row seat because it is not
15651,"This was a complete crock. They switched plane types and what i ended up with was tight limited leg room with two by two instead of one by one on angle. I spent three time more than coach and it was way not worth it. Also, i confirmed plane type with airline morning of flight and the lied or didn't know (same in my book)."
15652,22F - limited legroom/carry on due to inflight entertainment system in front seat.  Ditto for 22E.
15653,This seat is listed as being in the exit row but actually has less legroom than the standard economy seats on this plane.  The area underneath the seat in front of you is also narrower than standard.  I'd skip this seat.
15654,35A and 35B have obstructed foot room due to entertainment boxes under seat in front.
15655,"My family flew American Airlines Flight 144 from Honolulu to Los Angeles. The last row in First Class (row 4) was okay except for the recline. Also, it feels pretty private, which is nice."
15656,"11D & 11E are exit row seats (there is no 11F) with enormous legroom. There *is* ample room to store a backpack, briefcase, etc. beneath the seat(s) in front of you in row 10. HOWEVER, the IFE system is stored below the seat, and tray tables are stored in the armrests -- seriously reducing the seat width.  Combine that with AA's ""slimline seats,"" and this is perhaps the most uncomfortable Exit Row I have ever sat in."
15657,"I flew United to MCO & returned on AA.  First, I fly with my small dog on occasion.   BTW, he's not an emotional service animal.  I pay his fare every time. I think he should get a FF # actually. I always take a window seat with him. His carrier slides under the seat in front of me.   Previously I found the fit under the aisle seat (2B) much tighter.  But in this seat there is some type of fitting/covering on the legs of the seat in front of you.  It narrows the width opening by a good couple inches.  I'm not sure he would make it now.  Could be a problem in the future.   The plane is new, bright, clean and I had a nice flight.  I'm 5'8"", the leg room is OK.  But, I do have serious worries regarding my dogs future flights.  He's not going under the plane & I won't leave him at home.  I'll look at other airplanes and Airlines. Technically he's a paying customer!"
15658,"I flew first class from Los Angeles to Miami and then back from Miami to Los Angeles.  I had the second version of Airbus 321 aircraft, where there are four rows of seats in first class, with two seats on each side of the aisle.  The Airbus 321 is a smaller aircraft.  I'm a little over 6'5"" and I must say this was the least amount of leg space that I've ever had on a first class flight.  There was enough room, but I think the leg space in this arrangement is equivalent to what coach leg space used to be in the glorious past days of flying.  The in flight entertainment monitors are on the back of the seat in front of you.  If the passenger should tilt the seat back, you need to pull the bottom of the monitor out so that the monitor isn't facing your legs. The seat cushion was not padded very well and became slightly uncomfortable during the flight.  The meal they served for lunch was fabulous.  They also had hot fudge sundaes and warm chocolate cookies.  American Airlines flies the 777-300 from LAX to MIA.  We had one person on our cruise who flew business class and loved their pod seats.  I would recommend that you book the 777 if you are flying Los Angeles to Miami."
15659,"The seat does NOT have limited recline. In fact, it's more generous than most coach seats.  The same holds for the entire row. 

 The downside to this seat, and 10F, is a misaligned window, which is about 9 to 11 inches too far forward.  Or, put better, the seat is 9 to 11 inches too far behind the window for easy viewing."
15660,11B has no floor storage. There is floor storage for 11A and 11C.
15661,"There are NO power outlets on this flight.  Not even in first class.  Make sure all your devices are fully charged before you board.  This was a new A321.  Give me the ancient MD80s any day.  They were silent up in first, and you could here those engines roar back in coach."
15662,"The armrests are immovable and it is the narrowest seat on the plane. Ample leg room is available, so if you're tall, but not big, it's a great seat."
15663,"Bulkhead seat.  For a ""1st Class"" seat, pretty un-remarkable, it glides rather than reclines.  Legroom decent, but if you glide back, it is reduced.  I realize this is not a ""jumbo"", but for AA to call this section 1st class is a joke...Business maybe! I seriously was more comfortable on 737 1st than this AirBus. Seat ""cushion"" worked for about an hour, then it seemed like a folding card chair or banquet seat."
15664,Great seat if you are a bulkhead flyer.  Large new tv screens.
15665,Comfy seat and nice entertainment system.  Headphone jack is on the arm rest towards the front and can be tricky to locate.  Plenty of power options for your electronics 110/220 outlet and USB plugs.  The seat is the type that reclines and slides the seat forward.
15666,"The work horse of the busy domestic routes, the 321-V2, get a heavy traffic load. Accordingly, the seats have a lot of pelvises wearing out the cushions. Even in Business Class the seat cushion is thin. Recline is as advertised 38 degrees, doesn't help much. But hey, the economy seats are certainly no better. Industry employees and engineers can add what comments they can about replacing the seat cushion every......500-1000 air hours? I assume this craft is basically a commuter between trunks such as MCO, TPA, MIA and RSW."
15667,Extra legroom but does not fully recline due to Exit Row behind. Seats are way too narrow -- and I'm fairly thin!
15668,"Seat had perfect window alignment and ample leg room, however the feet space was partially unavailable due to electronics panel located near foot area"
15669,"yes, i paid extra for this seat for additional legroom. i had additional knee room, but i had LESS feet room due to the annoying flight entertainment box. one loses 25% to 33% of the feet room due to the box.I'm 6'3"", and i don't agree with anyone saying the legroom is great!"
15670,"This is a bulkhead seat, but since this was a newer plane the screens were on the wall instead of a pull-out from the arm rest. There was definitely more lefroom than other MCE seats.  We would choose these seats again...our trip was LAX to LIH"
15671,Large electronic box under seat in front takes about 1/4 of leg room away.
15672,"Great new plane. Very nice and new. Good seats and good screen for entertainment.
Much nicer than older 737."
15673,Row 25 is NOT an exit row despite American's representation to the contrary.  No more legroom than standard coach seats.
15674,Although you have ample leg room you have no video screen and you power outlet is under 12E.
15675,"This seat is NOT an exit row seat, just as Seat Guru describes it.  However, AA presents it as such.  Even when I scanned my boarding pass they asked if I was willing and able to assist in the event of an emergency.  It's a very tight seat and I was pretty disappointed since I was expecting emergency exit legroom.  So just a word of warning."
15676,"Flew this plane MIA to LAX and noticed that both 11D and 11E in front of me reclined, quite a bit to the point I could barely see the screen.  Hands down 12F is the best seat in MCE.  No one in front of you and you have enough room to go out to the aisle in front of row 11.  It also seemed the monitors in row 11 and 12F are slightly larger than the normal monitors as they are not in the seat back."
15677,"It is difficult to understand how there could be any positive reviews of these economy seats.  I wish I had a measuring tape on the plane, as I am skeptical about the 18 inch width cited on Seatguru.  This was the narrowest seat I have ever experienced.  Also, the armrests are barely an inch wide, so the space between passengers is further limited.  I am not very tall, but the leg room was almost non-existent.  While there is a video screen on the back of each seat, my eyes could not focus on it because it was just a few inches from my face.  Since the middle seat was also occupied by an adult, I spent the entire flight leaning into the aisle, and I was continually chastised by the FAs going back and forth."
15678,"Travelling 1st class in the red-eye from Honolulu to Los Angeles, seat 1A has legroom that is significantly impaired by the bulkhead. Completely different from 3F were I was sitting on my way to HNL and which was very comfortable. Suddenly I could understand why people put ther feet against the bulkhead as after a few hours you don't know where to put them anymore. Just a few inches extra would be great, especially considering this is 1st class.
Also, some cabin crew in the front galley were extremely chatty throughout the night and my wife had to ask them to be a bit more quiet as we couldn't sleep. The chief-flight attendant was very kind and helpful by the way."
15679,"This seat was great, (compared to AA B737 which was awful), it's was a nice and modern plane, and I watched movies the entire journey (Boston Logan to Miami) 3 hrs approx.
Legroom was great for a tall guy like me (6'1 feet) and the seats were in leather and very confortable.

Nice job AA!!"
15680,"Called main cABIN EXTRA -- BUT HAS LESS LEGROOM THAN THE BASIC MAIN CABIN SEAT.
tHIS AIRPLANE IS A PASSENGER NIGHTMARE!  nEVER FLY ON IT."
15681,"Sat in this seat OGG-LAX. Leg room and knee room is fantastic. Seat width is greatly reduced vs regular coach seats, and is downright painful. Consistent with other reviewers of this row, I am in good shape and am not of greater than average width. I am also 6'6"". The discomfort caused by the narrowness of this seat almost made me consider forfeiting the legroom for that extra inch or so of seat width. Almost."
15682,"Bullhead seat with the fat airbag seat belts, and arm rest tables. These are not the best seats. I would rather take row nine."
15683,Very bad experience. Limited leggroom for a tall person despite paying fees for seat selection and window seat cramped by a box (cables or other for tv) under seat in front.
15684,"Lots of leg room, excellent for a tall person like myself. The seat had minimal padding & while the flight was less than 1 hour I was uncomfortable. Can't imagine being confined to that seat any longer. Exit row seat with no under seat storage allowed under the seat in front for safety reasons according to the flight attendant. Best part of the seat was the leg room."
15685,"The description of AA's First Class seats on their 32B's as recliners is one more example of AA's deceptive advertising practices for the last few years.  From stating they have the newest fleet (four years before they would even be flying the planes), our experience did not match their advertising descriptions.  The First Class seats are a combination of the back reclining maybe 3"" and the seat sliding forward again maybe 3"", the resulting position being both uncomfortable and narrow."
15686,"Flew LAX to MCO on 9/23/16 in seat 13 F. While AA charges extra for this, it is NOT a MCE seat! Seats 13 A,B,C, are MCE with noticeably more legroom. Row 14 is NOT MCE! Window seat with good view out of window. I felt this seat was a little cramped. When seat 12F fully reclined I felt like it was in my face! Seat back video monitor with so-so choices of movies, games and music. There is storage over row 12, but as mentioned, there is a life raft in bin over row 13. Across the aisle over row 11/12 there is also emergency equipment so no storage there either. Under the seat in front of this row there are 3 boxes, 2 under center seat, 1 on aisle seat. Limits your under seat storage or leg room. Row 11 is an exit row and there is no seat in front of 12F giving that seat extra leg room. Row 8 is first row in MCE and there is a hard wall in front of this. Seats have video monitors in arms making less width in these seats. Last row is 36 and those seats DO NOT RECLINE. Seat layout chart is accurate, read comments, this plane has some odd configurations and not all seats are equal. In standard economy the seats have limited recline and felt more narrow than other aircraft. This was a newer plane and I felt the seat comfort was fine. I was very warm in this part of the plane and I was uncomfortable. There was a power port for charging phones and laptops in front of me. Tray tables are small and when person in front of you fully reclines there is NO room for a laptop to be open.
 
Bring your own earphones as they are not provided! No charge for movies, I did not use WIFI but it is an option (for a fee)"
15687,"I despise the three and three arrangement.  I prefer the aisle seat.  I'm an average size man, but my shoulders are still to broad to fit in the confines of the seat.  But getting the aisle is not always possible.  When both of my shoulders are touching other people, it makes me feel claustrophobic. 

The space between my chest and the seat back in front of me felt much to close.  There seems to be more room on Boeing 737s and 757s than on a Airbus (bus being the operative word here)."
15688,"I took a flight from DFW-SJU, It was worth paying the extra $78 for main cabin extra, I got two windows, enough space (5'11"", 220lbs) for myself, the seat reclined a bit more than older models and also the seat itself moved forward to add more recline, the entertaining system was great. Saw movies and t.v. shows from the moment I sat on the chair to moment the doors opened for debarkation. I was able to charge my phone either from the USB from the monitor or the plug under the seat. The plane looked cleaned but from close inspection I could tell it needed a deep cleaning"
15689,The overhead bin at 13D contains airline equipment (life raft)
15690,"Some other comments are mistakenly for the old USAir 321 configuration.  This is a new configuration - great IFE, powerports etc., but seat has thin padding, and to me seems lower shoulder height than some other F seats.  Not very comfortable for longer hauls - if you qualify for MCE/extra legroom seats in coach you're not missing a lot."
15691,This seat 11E is a few inches narrower than a standard seat. It is enough to be noticeable and a bit uncomfortable.
15692,"The aircraft was spotless and appeared brand new, The ""First Class: seat was very similar to that offered on the 737-800. However, the solid bulkhead reduced the legroom to the point that it was impossible to get comfortable. I am 5'11"", you may want to consider sitting behind this seat and take the risk of someone reclining if you are taller. My colleague in 1A commented that it was the most uncomfortable seat she had ever experienced."
15693,10A is an MCE seat that does NOT recline. I dony recommend siyting here becausr 9A can recline abd the MCE advantage is gone.
15694,"A321S N160AN Delivered May 5 2016. Basic economy seat. Legroom restricted from 31"" pitch.  Electronic box limits foot space.  Seat cushion hard.  Thick seat due to IFE restricts room in front of face.  IFE ok, soon to be no charge late 2016.  More engine noise in cabin than back row CRJ 700.  Old 767-200 better seat comfort in coach.  Plane less than one yr old."
15695,"Rows 34 and 35, seats A, B, D and F have entertainment boxes that obstruct foot space"
15696,"although a standard seat it has an adequate leg room (i am 6' 1"") and width (for a 215 lbs male)"
15697,"24D and 24E are great for legroom. However, on long flights, the proximity to the lavatory makes for a miserable experience. People decide itm is perfectly OK to line up or wait for the lavatory in the space directly in front of these seats. I had a parade of people's rear ends in front or to the side of me for half the flight, bumping into me, my laptop, effectively convincing me two hours into the flight never to sit there again."
15698,"Contrary to a previous user comment, Seat 25A does have an entertainment screen.  It's mounted on a swing-up arm that folds between Seats 25A and 25B.  I assume the same is true for Seat 25F.  I observed that the seats in Row 24 also have swing-up entertainment screens."
15699,"Despite being in an exit row, Seat 25C is worse than the standard seat because the entertainment system for Seat 24C obstructs the right side of foot space.  The same obstruction exists for Seat 25B and the mirror image seats across the aisle."
15700,"The updated A321s in American's fleet are very comfortable, definitely better than the 737-800. No complaints about seat width or legroom, the inflight entertainment unit worked well, and there was an abundance of complimentary movies and tv shows. Overall, a pleasant flight from DFW to SJU."
15701,"Paid extra , seat still unusable for laptop, due to thick entertainment center"
15702,"No power port, seat was uncomfortable and no IFE.  Service was good however."
15703,Flew in this seat April 2016 it has entertainment that swings out from under seat. Did not know until flight attendant explained it to me. Lots of leg room
15704,"Seats 14A and 14C are horribly cramped.  This is a main cabin extra and is horrible!  Virtually no leg room at all.  My wife is 5 feet 3 inches tall and there was not enough room for her to bend over and tie her shoe; same for me and I'm 6 foot 2 inches tall.  The seat in front of me reclined and I was trapped.  I put a magazine on the tray table and there wasn't enough room for me to turn the pages normally; I had to slide each page over.  The storage area on the seatback is very small, much smaller than on other planes.  This is my first experience flying on this aircraft, and I will avoid this aircraft at all costs in the future.  When making a reservation, I will check the type of plane, and I will NOT fly on this aircraft again."
15705,This is an exit row seat with alot of legroom. However the seat itself was  very uncomfortable. Padding was thin and the seat was very narrow. I'm fairly small and still felt stuffed into the seat.
15706,The seat back pockets on the newly designed plane are extremely small and will only hold something like a tablet and/or phone.
15707,"I was in the A321 2 times recently: PHL>PHX and OGG>LAX. The first flight lacked power ports or IFE, though the seats were comfortable and the flight attendants were friendly. The second flight to LAX was a brand new product. Full power port availability, iIFE w plenty of audio, TV, and movies."
15708,"I sat in 1C, which I liked. Aisle and access to the bathroom. The man in 1A was dealing with a very very bright light from the galley, but it's out of view for 1C. It's bad enough it should be in the tips on the seat guru map, and a showstopper for night flights."
15709,Excellent seat allowing for lots of legroom.  Filthy and worn old plane.  American Airlines should be embarrassed to allow this plane to in the air.
15710,"I think this seat is standard, so it shouldn't be yellow. The lavatories didn't really bother me. Otherwise, this plane is really good for Economy. at 5'10, this was a good plane to be on. Everything was practically new, fresh, and well taken care of. All options were great, and it was comfortable for flights longer than 5 hrs. I highly recommend flying with this plane!"
15711,Good legroom.  Ridiculous seat width.
15712,"Surprised by how comfortable this seat was for flight from Kauai to LAX.  This plane is new & the entertainment options were great.  This seat did not have extra leg room, but both myself & husband (taller) were comfortable. Underseat storage was just fine (accommodated backpack). Sadly cannot say the same for our connecting flight from LAX to ORD..which was horrible."
15713,"Skinny seat.  I am 6'3"" but in good shape.  I can barely fit in this seat.  Entertainment system flips up from below.  AC power outlet behind your legs is nice and the seat has excellent legroom.  Another plus is there is no seat on your left side so you don't share the left armrest."
15714,"I suspect this seat has less legroom than other standard economy seats on the A321S. Typically I can use my computer without resorting to ""T-Rex"" hands, not so in this seat. There's no room at all. A middle seat further up or back would be more desireable."
15715,"SFO-CLT redeye. A321-2 configuration. No inflight entertainment, power, etc. Awful 1st class product."
15716,"This seat was awful the pitch was bad the seat cushion was like a cloth covered piece of plywood. I like the bulkhead seat and ask for 1a, or 1f, but no more airbus for me,By the way the galley door was fabric every time she would slide it open the light on the wall was blinding.Do not get this seat or any AA 321 first class seat that matter. i,m going Boeing or i ain't going.phi"
15717,There's a small space under the seat in front of this one that accommodates a small backpack.  Flight attendants allow storage in this space provided it does not interfere with exit door egress.
15718,"This must be one of the worst experiences ever: First Class on a 6 hour journey: the seat reclines less then 1 inch. No entertainment system, no pillows provided. First class was full, economy empty, so i retreated into the back to get a full row and some sleep. Shame on American to sell such a sub standard product"
15719,25B is marked as an exit row by American but adds no extra space. The window seat next to it has the TV under the seat and tray on the left armrest claiming it for that seat. The equipment under the seat in front limits where your feet can fit. I am tall 6 feet 2 and was unable to move my legs the entire flight. Worst seat i have ever sat on a plane. Additionally the screens bulge out so when the person in front leans back it is very close to your face and very claustrophobic.
15720,Flew from LAX-DFW on Dec 9th 2015. Great seat for a 3.5 hour flight! I don't remember much as I was nearly asleep after a 15 hour flight from Australia. But American has vastly improved since I last flew with them in 2010. Seatback TVs were good. Got free drinks and I didn't even know that this was a Main Cabin Extra seat until I actually got on the plane! The extra legroom was nice.
15721,"Flew DFW-CLT. As a small person, 4F was comfortable. However, the IFE box reduced the amount of storage space under the seat. I ended up putting my bag under the center partition between the two seats in front of me. Service was excellent, and the flight crew/attendants were very friendly."
15722,"Seats 25 B,C,E,D are marketed as exit seats and priced as preferred seats. They show up as exit rows on your ticket, but have standard leg room, because the real exit row is row 24. This row lacks the window and aisle seats, so that only 25A and 25F have extra leg space, but not B,C,D,E. Buyer beware!"
15723,New A321S.  So nice compared to the 737-800 we flew out (MCO-DFW).  Clean and relatively comfortable MCE seat.  IFE was really very good. Hate that Airbus is so much better than Boeing - maybe it is just the way AA orders them.  It did take forever to load this plane since it is so big for a single aisle.
15724,"12D is booked as an exit row seat according to the American website but it is NOT an exit row seat. Though it might be considered Main Cabin Extra, this seat is only an inch or two longer than the main cabin seats and the least legroom of any MCE row. I do NOT recommend this seat. The only MCE seats of any decent size are rows 11 forward. Row 11 has an enormous amount. I did not go aft to look at the rear MCE seats."
15725,"Beware of this seat.  It has two metal items under the seat in front so you have very little foot room, about half of normal.  You can not put any type of bag there and you can't even move your feet."
15726,"This plane is vastly comfier than American's B738.  The extra inch of seat width is really noticeable; the plane is new and modern; you and you get a great IFE system.  I didn't find the underseat equipment box to be in the way at all, but I wasn't trying to store any bags there at the same time.  I'm 5'10/ 160, and thought that the seat was as comfy as you could hope to find in economy.  Seriously, a really well done interior.. I wish they would replace every 737 in their fleet with these!"
15727,"One of the better seats on the plane, until you have to get in a fight with 11E on who owns the window shade."
15728,"A decent bulkhead row seat, not the most spacious in the world but nothing to complain about. If anything, my biggest issue was with the extra padded seat belt, which further reduced the seat width when paired with the immovable armrests. There's a magazine pouch in front of the seat which provides a bit of storage, and the screen isn't terrible, though all I did was watch the flight info since I bring my own entertainment."
15729,"I flew on this flight from Boston Logan to Dallas Forth Worth. I was very excited to see that American had installed the new entertainment system on their new A321's. Each seat had it's own personal tv. The tv also has a usb outlet so you can plug your electronics in and another jack as well (although it takes a long time for it to charge up your electronics than if they were plugged into a standard wall outlet.) My favorite part was the map system. AA uses a 3d mapping system where you can see the plane moving in 3 dimensions. The flight path is projected in 3 dimensions as well. This is especially helpful for landing to see which track you are taking. This is something that I have never seen in any other airline. I was too cheap to buy the movie package at $4.99 but for a 4 or 5 hour flight, it would probably be worth it. it also comes loaded with music and games (which also cost money.) Originally I was in seat 35 F but then switched my seat the night before to seat 20E. I was concerned that there wouldn't be enough overhead space to put my bag if I was in the back. This was false. There was plenty of room. This seat was a good choice, because it is centrally located in the aircraft. Although the lavatory is relatively close, I didn't notice it much at all."
15730,This seat has TWO video boxes in the foot well so there is very little space for backpack or your feet
15731,"Even though these are premium exit row seats and there is a row of seats in front of you, the stern AA F/A indicated that you could NOT store ANY carryon underneath the seat in front of you because this was an exit row. She indicated this was an FAA restriction. BUYER BEWARE if you select this premium product seat. You'll have legroom but your carryover has to be stored in an overhead. Also, the overheads immediately above these seats have emergency equipment so you either have to store your bags forward or behind you. If behind, you're swimming upstream to try to get your bag and carryon as passengers are exiting."
15732,"Seat had alot of room and space, plus the seats recline. Plus im a big guy 6'4 about 240 fit perfect."
15733,"These seats are miserable for the nearly 6 hours you are in them. AA has a lot of nerve charging first class prices for them. Also, you cannot tell from their online info OR from calling an agent whether this flight is the upgraded A321 or the old one. I was told it is upgraded, lie flat seats. It is NOT. It is old, uncomfortable and I cannot see that it is much better than coach, which is 1/3 the price. Also note, the seats do not actually recline, they sort of move up like a barcalounger with no footrest, more comfortable upright. Meals consist of a bag of chips on takeoff and a plate of fruit and yoghurt 2 hours before arrival. On an overnight flight."
15734,There is a solid partition to the floor and immovable armrests. You can not extend your legs or adjust by moving the armrest. The partition is to close and it is a shame they call this a main cabin extra seat.
15735,"There is NO entertainment option whatsoever if you sit in this seat. Yes there is leg room but on a 4 hour flight with no entertainment unless you plan to sleep or have your own option, please be aware of this. It made it a VERY long flight."
15736,"This seat was horrible.  It was sold to us as Economy Plus but was not.  Row 13 A-C is, but not 13 D-F.  As others have said, the economy seats in this plane are very uncomfortable and inhumanely cramped.  I will work to avoid this plane moving forward but will definitely make sure to get an upgrade on any flight over 2 hours."
15737,"As stated before, plenty of places to put a drink etc.  The IFE was non responsive or overly jumpy.  After two hours, the seat was very uncomfortable.  I can only imagine how a longer flight would not be an enjoyable one."
15738,"The extra legroom is great, but it's effectively a bulkhead seat, as there's no storage. Also, there is no personal entertainment screen."
15739,"i have flown over a million miles and this seat is the worst i have ever been in.  the male flight attendent had to push the seat to get it to recline uding the wall for support and had to do the same with other seats in first.  the second leg of my trip i had a similar seat location with the exact opposite result, everytime i moved the seat would slide into or out of the reclining position.  american should be imprisoned for fraud for selling trash like this for first class seating."
15740,There is a power box that limits space for your carryon under the seat.
15741,"I think the bulkhead seats at row 8 needs to be classified as mixed review. The wall at 8ABC is closer to you than the wall at 8DEF. Regardless, you will not be able to stretch your legs out, but you do get knee room. The 8A second window is between the bulkhead dividing first class and economy, and the pax in first reached back and slammed the window shut. The IFE was not operational for this flight."
15742,"The seat is comfortable in the upright position, there are plenty of places to put your drink, phone, etc. The entertainment system is excellent, but!

When the seat is reclined it is the most uncomfortable seat, it doesnt actually recline, the seat moves forward and its like sitting on a lounger that someone had picked up to tip you out."
15743,"My wife and I flew round-trip PHX-DFW on this model A321 (AA calls it A321S). Do not confuse this model with the older USAir version. We had reserved 14C and 14D to be across from each other. The AA and SeatGuru seat maps do not show that these rows in the 11 to 15+ area are offset by approximately a half row. You are not truly directly across. Not a big deal but it would be nice if the maps were accurate. Row 14 is not MCE but the space was OK as the passengers in the seat ahead did not recline their seats on either segment.  I did not recline mine either and it was tolerably comfortable for the 2 hour flight.  The interactive flight display provided some welcome entertainment/distraction. The cockpit view was a nice variation. The seatback in front has both power and headphone jack connections under the screen.  The inflight entertainment boxes under the seats reduce available storage space slightly. Typical flight noise in takeoff and cruise, but the most rattles and shaking I've ever heard upon landing. There's a life raft in the overhead bin over row 13 reducing bin space in the area. I still prefer the 2 seat side of an MD80 but this was an OK experience."
15744,"This comment is also valid for 2A and 2C across the aisle.  There is effectively very little under seat storage space in front of row 2 in the AA 321 V2. This is because there is a very large and obtrusive electronic box under the Row 1 seats, plus two seat anchor brackets.  Thus what space that does exist is broken up into small chunks.  My wife and I were unable to put even a modest sized article under there. A purse is about all that would fit."
15745,"This seat was sold to us as an exit row by the airline but it is not,  only one seat is.  This seat had am armrest that is not movable because it is next to the one actual exit seat."
15746,"Tray tables are in the armrest making it a bit snug for larger people.  Nice entertainment system, but both myself and my wife had to reset ours to get them to work.  My touchscreen wasn't responding and her's kept saying it was downloading content.  Luckily the FA helped us out.  

The new A321SL is a nice plane and made going back to a B738 feel like a downgrade."
15747,"DFW-JFK. Plenty of legroom, even for someone who's 6'2"". Comfy seat, great IFE, and decent amount of storage space. Best domestic (non-transcon) first out of the big 3 major airlines."
15748,"Seats in coach are ridiculously cramped. If someone in front reclines it could hit you in the face. It also takes forever to load this airplane. It's worse than a 757 leaving Orlando. There is a call button on the screen that people keep pushing, mainly because they just love pushing ALL the buttons. The attendant made an announcement almost pleading with people not to push it. Unless you are in First or MCE, this is not a pleasant experience at all. If you are on a flight over 2 hours consider upgrading or something else."
15749,25F on new A321S (non-transcon 32B). Tons of legroom due to no seat in front. You still have access to underseat storage in row ahead. Personal video comes up from below.
15750,"This seat is decent, however the tray table sticks out toward you quite a bit more than needed, due to the fact that there is a space behind the tray table for magazines, and the tray table folds in on itself. There is in-flight entertainment on this plane. I was able to fit my guide dog under the seat in front of me without any issue, which has become more of a concern with the large IFE boxes particularly on the American 737s. I don't recall if there was an IFE box under the seat in front of me at all."
15751,"MCE seat with lots of exit row legroom, but no underseat storage in front due to exit equipment."
15752,"Short window-side armrest, fixed armrest on right side for tray table. Bulkhead extends to floor so short leg room."
15753,"I was quite impressed with the first class on this Airbus aircraft on a really good flight from DFW-LAX. Legroom was good, the personal entertainment screen froze a bit but it was reset and it was all ok."
15754,"We flew out of DFW to LAS!  I couldn't believe how nice this plane was!  I sat by the window. It was a night time flight!  I know I have a hard time describing about how the plane was but it was terrific! Touch screen with interactive flight map on the back to see where you were!   It had the food for puchase menus on the touch screen and beverage menu too!   I was in economy class!  The seats were comfortable!  I am really proud how American kept up with there fleet.   I am glad they are getting rid of the MD80s and going with planes that are lesser fuel, but this plane was an exception.  I give this plane 5 stars for American and window seat was nice on this plane!!!!"
15755,"Row 11 may have the most leg room on the plane... I can't touch the seat in front of me even if I fully extend my legs. 

But the catch is you have no storage under the seat in front of you because it's an exit row and the overhead compartment on both sides is marked ""no stowage"" due to first aid, oxygen, fire extinguishers, flight attendant stuff, etc.  So you're forced to use an adjacent bin.   It's probably not a major problem since you're most likely one of the first to board if you have this seat.  But, it's still an inconvenience. 

Also can't watch TV or movies during takeoff/landing since it needs to be stowed in the armrest."
15756,26-D was my favorite seat in the plane. This plane was nice and the cabin for seat 26-D
15757,"My wife and I had the good fortune to fly the new 32B as a replacement for the S80 scheduled for this flight.  I was really pumped to experience the latest 1st class offer from AA.  Unfortunately, the 32B is a disappointment.  Starting with spooling the engines, the plane is loud and it vibrates a lot.  Not at all like a quieter 737.  But that's not all! Backing from th34 gate, the brakes rubbed/vibrated so much, I wondered whether the plane was fit to fly. We were flying from DFW-DEN on a regular sort of day, CLR in DFW and BRKN clouds on our approach into DEN.  What I noticed was our really bumpy ride in. This planes likes to bounce around, not sure why, but seems unlike the 737-800 which seems to ride bumpy air better.  We were all pretty darn happy to land, to hear those clunking sounds of the landing gear and the vibration of the brakes engaging.  After all the hype of the 321 transcon, I had high expectations, now I'm not so sure I want another flight on this aircraft."
15758,"First time flying the AA A321 regular cabin, nice and clean looking. Seat 1A is nice, legroom not too bad and seat comfy. Not sure how economy fares but ignore the daft comments about Airbus packing the seats in, American chose the seating configuration not the manufacturer."
15759,"The seats at 12DEF are considered exit seats because they have direct access to an exit. It has nothing to do with the amount of leg room - the real exit row is 11 ABC/DE. This is where you will have the most legroom. Again row 25ABC/DEF is the same as mentioned above, it is merely because they have direct access to the exit.

Also when it comes to being ""cramped"" the 321 is actually similar in size the 757 with a 5"" difference in length but a 6"" difference in width - meaning the 321 is 5"" shorter but 6"" wider..... The Recaro seats on the Airbus also improve comfort as the whole seat reclines, bottom cushion as well as back, not just the back."
15760,Every seat except the premium  seats are cramped. For longer flights upgrade for a premium seat on any flight over three hours. Airbus packs them in!  Very tight  coach seating!  If  you want  space select Boeing aircraft!  If it  aint  Boeing we aint going!   LOL
15761,"The standard Coach Class/Main Cabin seat. Extra legroom if you stretch your legs out toward the aisle. Seatback TV Movie options cost money on Domestic flights but are free on International flights. Recline is standard, 3"" of recline. The tray table is better than most tray tables on mot planes. Love the 3 x 3 seat arrangement and not the 2 x 3 x 2 seat arrangement. Overall, the plane is your standard narrowbody jet with seatback TV. Seat Pros: Extra legroom if stretched legs toward aisle. Cons: It can get noisy due to proximity to the engine. Seat overall rating: 8.3/10"
15762,As a frequent traveler I'm very disappointed in the exit rows on these new planes.  I always booked the 2nd exit row near wing and was very content.  2nd exit row on these new planes is not the same at all.  12E had half the storage space as aisle seat under the seat - not enough for my laptop bag.  Leg room not even close to old exit rows. Seat pocket was barely big enough to fit a water bottle. Tried to use my laptop and pitch was so limited I couldn't see my screen and finally gave up.  11B lots of legroom but NO storage space under seat.  It's basically a bulk head seat as the seats in front as so far away you can't reach them & they won't let you use the under seat for storage.  Overheads are filled with emergency equipment so you have to go several rows away to access your bags - no room to store anything. Both rows are horrible now for the frequent business traveler.  VERY disappointed with American now.
15763,"It was my observation that both 11D and 11E were narrower than the same seats in rows 10 and 12.

For the record, I sat in 12F and your comments for that seat are right on -- it's probably the best coach seat on the plane."
15764,Excellent aircraft.  Very comfortable.  The in flight amenities were second to none.  I would recommend flying on AA's A321 for any route.
15765,"These new A321s a a big improvement on the 757's and even 737's. The in-seat entertainment in First Class is phenomenal, and because Airbus cabins are a little wider, I found it very easy to sleep against the wall (there's a good 5"" of space there). For those in economy, AA has gone with Airbus' standard 18"" seat, almost 1"" bigger than the 737 which is 17.2. They can't replace their old planes with these new ones fast enough as I am concerned."
15766,"This was my first time on the ""new"" A321B in seat 3F.  The seat was typical wide for domestic first.  However, the seat pitch being at 38 really showed in real life when using the seat as it seemed very tight and claustrophobic.  Was glad to be in first on another AA Boeing plane."
15767,"This seat had a window that lined up at my shoulder, which I was pleased with. However, there really isn't much legroom. I felt really crammed the entire time. There is no charging ports as other reviews have mentioned. Decent window at least."
15768,"First of all, any 1st class seat is great. However, the downside to this one is it does not have any electrical outlets or seat back TV. Really???? The service though trumps any of that...sort of.  4F is great because you bave no one behind you, you have your own coat rack, and you have 2 windows for your viewing pleasure. Legroom is not limited in the least. Get enoigh drinks and you'll quickly forget about the limitations."
15769,"I flew in this seat on a SAN-PHL trip. These seats have no movable headrest and negative (hollowed out) lumbar support. That might be okay on a short haul flight, but on a transcontinental, 5+ hour long flight it is a very cheap move by American to fly this plane."
15770,"Seat pitch is a little tight, I like to cross my legs and I could but not real comfortable.  It was hard for window seat pax to get out during flight.  I had to hold all drinks that were on center armrest so would not be knocked over."
15771,"If you travel at night the light from the bathroom shines on you so forget trying to sleep on a red eye. Plus, there were a couple people who would hang outside the bathroom and some even did stretches and stared at passengers. Also, on my flight, man stumbled and then fainted in row 22, landing  across the aisle. It felt like the people in aisle 22 are part of the AA Crew, but we have to pay extra for the privilege of all the commotion that is common here."
15772,This is an Old Bird so bring your backup batteries and charging cables because ther’s No A/C and No Video monitors! This plane should not be used for cross-country flights!
15773,"Plenty of legroom in this seat. No plug for phone, no movies. I sat staring at a gray divider for 5.5 hours. I got a good look at the cocktails, dinners, and ice cream sundaes in first class. The most boring flight ever."
15774,"The worst configuration that American Airlines flies.  They use this plane on 5-6 hour domestic flights, with NO seatback IFE, and NO power ports.  I don't know how you're supposed to view anything.  The wi-fi doesn't work,  it's basically a no-amenities flight.  BTW, Delta flies the Airbus 320-100 series and all the planes have seatback IFE, AC power plugs and USB power plugs."
15775,DFW to LAS yesterday.  Seat 13 F.  Plenty of leg room.  I was happy with it.
15776,Plenty of extra legroom (36+ inches) on exit row seat 10A. A321 Layout 2 (Main Cabin Extra)
15777,"I sat in the bulkhead row of 5, and it was nothing like the exit row's leg room (which is like the size of a walk-in closet), but it was definitely spacious enough for me to get up past my husband to use the restroom without him having to get up or move his things. It was MCE.

Also, it was a 4.5hr flight, Charlotte to LAS, and I was more than comfortable with being able to get up and walk around with my baby. The exit rows had large spaces to stand in, and the flight itself was barely half-full"
15778,"Flight 809 from Philly to Tampa was originally supposed to be an Airbus A320 however AA delayed the flight for 2 hours and apparently changed the aircraft to this one. 5D is supposed to be MCE & I paid extra for it because being a 5' 10"" fat guy with bad knees the extra legroom always helps. Well that was a mistake. 5D is facing the bulkhead and extra legroom is non-existent. I will never choose this seat again on this aircraft."
15779,"This seat is awful. There is indeed plenty of legroom, but this is the narrowest seat I've ever flown on. Combined with the lack of power outlets and IFE, plus the constant stream of people using the lavatory, this was the most uncomfortable flight I've ever taken and I can't believe I paid extra for it."
15780,"Tightest seat you can imagine. I am 6'3"" but other planes fit me OK. My knees where in the seat in front the whole trip. The entertainment display is nice but the closed caption feature didn't work so I couldn't watch movies."
15781,Had to lean forward to see through the window
15782,"This seat has an insane amount of legroom and there is floor storage in front.  However, recline is extremely limited."
15783,"I hadn't flown in a LONG time and was worried about flying at my size. I'm of average height (5'5'') but above average width! Plus size gal here (24w). The flight was SFO to CLT and I honestly don't know how I could have been any more comfortable. I did luck out and there was no one next to me, but still. Great seat."
15784,"The legroom is ok, but I'm glad this flight was only an hour and some change.  The window alignment for this seat is also the worst I've encountered."
15785,"Always nice to have first dibs on these seats as a status AA member. The jumpseat in front of 10F is actually facing backwards, unlike the seat map. Enough leg room for even the tallest person, though you have to store your bag in the overhead bin."
15786,"Pretty disappointing seat.  Plane is old and has no power outlet or entertainment system.  I can do without entertainment on a 4.5 hr flight, but no power outlet or USB????  Cmon.  Also, leg room is quite limited for First Class.  Next time Ill save the money and sit in an exit row in Coach."
15787,"This is one of the best economy seats on any domestic airline. There is no seat in front of you, so you have about 8 feet of legroom, and there's room to store your personal item under the seat 2 rows in front of you. There's a small upgrade fee, but less than to upgrade to MCE. On the whole the A321 is one of the nicer and more up-to-date planes in the AA fleet, but AA's economy product still lags behind Delta and JetBlue with no power ports and far more limited in-flight entertainment."
15788,"This version of the 321 is the ""newer"" plane verses the one they fly LAX-CLT which is thier 1980's version.  Seat is showing it's wear and tear.  Bulk Head seat has very little leg room so this row should show in red.  FA did bare minimum on what should be a signature flight. Food was tasty but very limited. I would recommend Hawaiian Air if going to the islands as they do a much better job on the routes."
15789,Giant electronics box here for non-existent seatback IFE.
15790,There is an installed box the restricts the under seat storage
15791,"Flew this plane from CLT to LAX.  This plane is missing IFE (Inflight Entertainment) and even bringing your own tablet you have to either download the IFE app or have the AA app on your phone or tablet to access the plane's entertainment.  Download you're entertainment beforehand or bring a big book.  This seat is your typical economy seat, uncomfortable, small, and cramped beyond belief.  The flight crew were good, gave me a couple of free cocktails due to taking so long to serve drinks and snacks.  Apologized for the wait and service which was nice.  My best suggestion is to download the AA app on your phone or tablet.  It gives you up to date information on everything from flight status, boarding pass, and checked luggage status."
15792,"The width on this seat has to be 14-15 inches ... it is incredibly tight.  They shrunk the seats down to make sure the exit door opens.  Supposedly, this is a Main Cabin Extra seat. Even though I'm Premium on AA and get Main Cabin Extra for free, I can't imagine if I had paid for this seat.  When attendant offered for anyone to move out of the exit row, I almost took the offer.  In all seriousness, it could be the worst seat I've ever been in.  I think a middle seat at the back of the plane would be better.  Throw in no power anywhere.  It ranks up there with worst flight ever.  Glad it was a 1.5 hour flight.  Some of the reviews tell real tales of torture.  No more A321 for me."
15793,"I paid extra for this crappy seat. Beware, does not recline and very close to the seat in front"
15794,"23D (and 23C) are terrible and shame on AA for selling them as ""extra room"" exit row seats.  Not only are they the same leg room as the rest of economy, the seats are narrower due to them having tray tables in the armrest unnecessarily.

I'm 5'9""  and my knees had about 2"" of room"
15795,"Seat 23A is NOT a Main Cabin Extra (MCE) seat.  While it has extra leg room due to no seat directly in front of it, AA markets and sells the seat as a Preferred Seat.  The cost for the MCE seat in the exit row in front of me was $71.  Seat 23A cost was only $31.  The same applies to seat 23F across the aisle."
15796,Seat does have storage under the seat in front of you (way in front of you).  It is nice and ope to the right for people with broad shoulders.
15797,I was in 31F on an American Airlines flight to Philly from Tampa and this seat is a perfect window seat.
15798,"This was an extremely disappointing First Class. SO not worth the money.
1. The seat pitch is very tight. When the people in front of me reclined their seat backs, I literally had to climb over my neighbor's seat to get out. Quite awkward.
2. There is no seat-back video, so you have to use your own device. I could never get mine to work, so no entertainment for me on this 5+ hour flight.
3. There is no power. So you're stuck with your own device for entertainment, but likely run out of juice mid-way through.
4. The food is barely so-so. A cup of mixed nuts, some chicken meatball thing that was ok, and then a packaged cookie for dessert."
15799,There was NO RECLINE and the seatback is close to vertical. It is the worst seat I have ever sat in on a flight. Plus it was a redeye flight which made it all the worse. I can always sleep on a flight but not this one and I paid EXTRA for that seat!
15800,"This is a domestic first-class seat with one window at the knee.  Due to constant friction from the jetway hood, the widow was very hazy from an abundance of scratches to the outside surface.  if you want a window to see through, do not choose 1A.  The seat was quite comfortable for the long haul from CLT to SFO.  It would have been more comfortable if there was a leg or footrest that comes out when you recline the seat.  The recline is not much, pretty comparable to economy.  The bulkhead seat gives you just a slightly lesser amount of leg room than a standard first-class seat.  The seat is wide and has a foldable headrest to keep your head in place should you wish to sit back and relax/sleep. Food service was mediocre; lasagne that was warm in some parts lukewarm in others. Dessert was a handmade sundae. FAs were very attentive and professional with their service.  Very disappointed AA does not offer IFE, power, or free wifi to first-class seats."
15801,"This is a domestic first-class seat with one window at the shoulder and one at the feet.  The seat was quite comfortable for the short hop from BWI to CLT.  It would have been more comfortable if there was a leg or footrest that comes out when you recline the seat.  The recline is not much, pretty comparable to economy.  Plenty of legroom and the seat is wide and has a foldable headrest to keep your head in place should you wish to sit back and relax/sleep. No food service on this short hop, but FAs were very attentive and professional with their service.  Very disappointed that AA does not have IFE, power, or complimentary wifi for first-class seats."
15802,"Seat 7A is a standard economy seat with one window at the shoulders and one at the knees.  I am not tall so I had no issues with legroom, seat width, or seat height.  This particular aircraft, N183UW, was an older plane with an older interior and was just a little bit uncomfortable at the end of the flight from PHX to DCA.  There was no IFE or power on at this seat."
15803,"Seat 6A is a standard economy seat with a window behind the shoulders and one at the knees.  I am not tall so I had no trouble with leg room, the width of the seat, or height of the seat.  For the short trip to PHX it was comfortable.  There was no IFE and no power at this seat.  This particular aircraft, N545UW had a newer interior with nicely finished seats."
15804,"The seat width is ""slightly narrowed."" I'm a 5'4"" female weighing 134 pounds and I found this seat very tight. The ""window"" is a 4"" diameter window in the exit door, worthless. I paid extra for this seat and was very disappointed. The legroom was good, but that was the only good feature of this seat."
15805,"Faced with a 5.5 hour flight on this aircraft,I chose this bulkhead seat for my 6'2"" body. Seat didn't recline and was uncomfortable after a few hours.  No power in seat which is unacceptable in today's world especially given that IFE is via your personal device(s).  Bulkhead wall was not open at the bottom which limited foot room.  Very disappointing."
15806,"This is a very roomy seat in the exit row. Theres room for a small bag in front of you (although not very close). No USB port.  
I choose this seat often."
15807,"This seat was a HORRIBLE waste of money. $86 for ""Main Cabin EXTRA"" was terrible. You are right next to the door so it is freezing, also the flight attendant's jump-seat is right in front of you so she will be going in and out over your legs. There IS extra legroom, but that's it.  The seat not only is smaller because the traytable is in the solid armrest, but it is actually a physically smaller seat width-wise than the seat directly behind it, and it is less cushiony owing to what seems like a pared down shape to squeeze the two seats and the jump seat into the bulkhead area. My husband sat in the aisle 22C and was run into constantly by passerbys.  Also bring an eye mask because as a red-eye, they shut the lights off for sleeping but the bathroom is right in front of you and every time that door opens its bright light.  There is NO entertainment or power plugs on this plane. Also no place to store things except overhead bins for these seats.  All in all, a giant waste of money, should have chosen one row back. Seat did recline some."
15808,Terrible seat for a red-eye - every time the bathroom door opens you get bright lights directly in your face
15809,"Agree with most comments here, almost 6h is a long time without IFE and lack of power for personal devices. The bulkhead in front of row 5 is curved, but still does not leave enough room to stretch legs. Not sure if it´s worth to be considered as MCE option."
15810,Chose this seat for extra leg room.  However  it has a divider in front of you  so you cannot stretch your legs out under the seat in front of you.  You also have to stow all your hand luggage formlanding and take off
15811,"Flew LAX=>CLT on 21 March 2018 in AA's so-called ""first class"" seat 3D on an A321.  What a disappointment - the interior is stripped-down no video or power ports anywhere on the plane, and GoGo in-flight wireless mostly non-functional.  Next time if I have to go on AA, I'll try to make it on another aircraft or go on Delta."
15812,Seat 6A has an equipment box that significantly restricts legroom and storage space
15813,"23F does have underseat storage.  You put your stuff under 21F.  It's a bit difficult to access during the flight, but if you're going to 35 inches of legroom, you have to reach 35 inches forward to get your things!  23A doesn't have storage because the crew jump seat is in front."
15814,There is a box under row 11 seats that limit leg room for row 12 seats. You should not pay the extra money for these seats.
15815,Ros 9 and 22 have 16.5 seats! People take these thinong they will get legroom. But in reality they are squeezed. Its awful. These rows should be marked RED
15816,"This flight is a nightmare in general, on very old equipment -- NO power ports, no entertainment even though the armrests have nonfunctional buttons and jack for audio. Seat space in coach is the tightly-packed misery we've come to expect from AA, but seat 7A adds a new low in foot space.  I don't know why we need those equipment boxes on the floor if not for entertainment (or what plane-mechanics could possibly require above-floor interior boxes?).  However, I measured how much of the footspace in front of seat 7A (under 6A's seat) was taken up by such a box and it was approx. 8"".  I could barely fit a soft-sided tote under there, and even if I hadn't had that, it wouldn't have given me much more foot room. Someone tall would have been miserable in that seat, or at least more miserable than in the others (including the tall guy in front of us who insisted on full recline for the entire flight.

I nominate 7A for lousy-seat status.  Foot space only roughly 9"" wide hardly qualifies for a handbag, let alone feet in normal shoes."
15817,"There are extinguishers plus the FAs put their luggage in the overhead bin that should be for your stuff so you DO NOT have a place for your carry on close to you if you're not one of the 1st 3 people on the plane. Across the aisle had their bin to use, but not our side. And they WILL make you put the carry on up. No entertainment, no plugs. Glad I hadn't paid full price for the seat and sorry I had wasted mileage. I hate Airbus and will not fly on one again."
15818,"Seat is great, however on the 321 V.3 there is no power outlets.  Not good for a 5 hour ride to PHX.  A/C is N152UW"
15819,"While seats 12A and 12F have no seat in front (as Row 11 has B-C-D & E only), seat 12F faces a jump seat used by the crew during taxi, takeoff and landing. That means there is ZERO underseat storage and all items have to be placed in the seat pocket or overhead bins. As noted by others, the TV monitor is in the armrest, making it a bit tighter than others but the biggest issue is no underseat storage."
15820,"This seat was showing on the map as reclining yet the button to do so was missing. The only seat in the entire row 8 that reclined was 8D. Seats A,B and C had a hard partition directly behind them."
15821,"All exit row 9-10 seats are fantastic if you value legroom and aisle access above all else. I'm 6', 175 lbs with longer than average legs; I book these seats as early as possible. This row has no in-flight entertainment system, so carry your own tablet/phone/etc. I've taken 5 hour flights in this seat and it's easily my favorite in the cabin."
15822,"Great leg room, can store small items under your seat if person behind you doesnt have anything. But the comments about being able to store items under seat 8F are a bit misleading - you can do that but bc of the jumpseat blocking, you have to twist and bend to get to your items.  And the FA had his/her bag stored there so even though I could fit my bag further in with the FAs, having to move the FAs bag each time would be a pain.  Youre better off storing any personal items in the overhead if sitting in this seat.  Great access in/out of the seat though!  Not too narrow a seat but then I am 55 and 110lbs (so fine for me)!"
15823,Standard seat with full underseat storage in front of you (no boxes or equipment or bags partially blocking the underseat storage like oftentimes there is).
15824,"Seat 24D is standard economy.  Nothing great, a little tight in leg room for me.

I am 6'4"" and had a tall passenger in 23D who leaned the seat back into my knees the whole trip.  See photos."
15825,Seat does not recline at all. When the seat in front is reclined working on a medium-sized laptop is difficult.
15826,"The seat does not recline at all and because of it being right in front of the lavatories, one can hear, loud and clear, everytime someone flushes. 
Perhaps it should be red."
15827,"I'm surprised these seats are considered first class.  The seat was lumpy and extremely uncomfortable.  The crew was great - they saw to it that passengers in first class were taken care of.  Will not fly American ""first class"" again."
15828,Best seat in aircraft. I'm 6-5. This is my go to seat. No seat in front of you. 23A and 23F are comparable. This seat can get a little cold as its by the door. I fly every week from CLT to NYC. Great for a one hour flight. AA renewed the interior of these planes. No power or seat back entertainment but not uncomfortable for an hour or two in my opinion.
15829,"I'm 6'5"" so leg room is of the upmost importance to me and outside of 1st class, this seat is my go-to anytime I fly and AA A321."
15830,"Sat in 2C on a flight from LAX to CLT.  The seat has no power, no IFE, no lumbar support at all, and minimal recline.  American should be embarrassed to sell this awful product as First Class.  Just lousy.  Definitely taking Delta to ATL from now on."
15831,This seat does in fact recline. Maybe less than normal seats but it does recline.
15832,10D and 10E should be colored yellow as they are limited in width with the tray built into the armrests.
15833,Never fly on this plane in first class. There is no power and no entertainment system. You can bring your own device but if it runs out of power - say for your child's ipad - you are out of luck. Better yet never fly AA if you can help it.
15834,Nice entertainment system with touch screen
15835,Decreased leg room due to box under seat in front.
15836,"CLT-LAX. I was thinking this plane & the interior might look really old since it's an ex-US Airways plane. However, the interior was renovated & looked relatively modern. The seat width & legroom were great for a 4.5 hour flight (I'm 5'9""), much more spacious than on the 737. Not having entertainment systems wasn't too bad, just bring your own stuff & make sure your devices are charged, as there are no outlets on this plane. Overall, would travel on this plane/seat again."
15837,"This seat is billed as an exit row seat but the leg room is no different than the other seats. Row 22 is the true exit row.  Bathroom proximity is bothersome and noisy. No window. Seats are narrower due to yray tables in the armrests. Bottom line, It's not worth the extra fee."
15838,"Lots of love for 10A on the a321.  Im 6'1"" and have room to roam!"
15839,"I boarded the aircraft for a 0600 Departure from LAX to CLT. The seat was wide, comfortable and reclined nicely. I'm used to making international flights and was a little disappointed that this aircraft was not yet equipped with inflight entertainment or AC Power or Wi-Fi but for the five hour flight I slept most of the way. This is only because the aircraft has not gone through the upgrade process yet and this takes time. The breakfast was surprisingly delicious and Flight Attendant was cordial. Overall the trip was good and I would do this again."
15840,If was good the seat but the food should be free cause its trancon. Are plane  had problems with the APU.no Tv monitor for the 5 hour flight? Thats to long with no momitor no movie no meals
15841,"Recline is definitely limited on this side of the row due to the partition separating the 'Main Cabin Extra' seating from Economy seating, although i believe this has not always been the case on other versions of this aircraft that I've flown."
15842,"I just want to say that the seat was fine.  However, passengers should really complain to flight attendants if their seats are less than satisfactory.  They will then report it to Captain which will write it up and give it to the mechanics.  And it will be fixed."
15843,Great seat.  No pocket for stuff.  Yes it reclines.
15844,"I flew on this plane from New York to LA.The seats were comfy but pretty old, and a bit worn. I was surprised to find that there was no tv screen, which was a bit disappointing, since I have paid 650$ extra, so that I could have some time to relax. At least the plane had wifi which was good, since I could use my phone to watch a movie during the flight. Food was OK, but nothing special. Crew was very polite, and the plane was clean overall. So-so flight."
15845,"Not the greatest seat. My plane was an older plane, retrofitted. The legroom was fine. The window being misaligned was a bit annoying but else okay unless you want to stare out the window all the time."
15846,This seat needs to be replaced as soon as possible. The seat does not recline and it move when the middle seat is slightly moved. The worst experience I have ever had on a flight.
15847,"If you have ANY additional padding in the hip area, AVOID this seat at all costs. With tray tables to the right and left of you, there is absolutely no give. My hips were so painful, and it was also affecting my knees. Grateful that another passenger was willing to switch with me. I will consult SeatGuru from now on for ANY seat selections!"
15848,"Seats are Ok.  They look new but lack tv screen, power port and don't have much cushion.  I expected better seats for an overnight First Class Seat"
15849,"My impression of flying First Class with AA on the Boeing 321 was of paying twice as much for a little larger jail cell.  No IFE, wi-fi for a crazy fee, but never mind, there are no charging ports, so really worthless anyway.The seats as least reclined more than 2-3 inches, as in the other 3 legs of the flights I booked first class.  Never again on AA.  Southwest was a better on business class, COPA first class had better meals, and guess what - TV screens, inflight entertainment, headphones!  Never again on AA first class, I'd rather fly connecting flights on modern airlines, even if it means connecting cities.  The FA's worked very hard to overcome your shortcomings, and apologized for the lack of amenities on the first class side of things."
15850,"Decent seat for view, a nap and carryon under seat in front of me."
15851,"No built-in entertainment. Free streaming of AA content to personal devices, but no power, so make sure your phone or tablet is fully-charged."
15852,"Very narrow and highly uncomfortable despite a missing row's worth of legroom...unless you have super-slim hips and no shoulders, avoid if at all possible."
15853,This was a 2005 vintage A321 that was the most uncomfortable plane I have ever been on.  No in seat amenities for the 4+ hour flight.  Glad my PC and iPad and Phone  were fully charged before the flight.  Make sure yours are too or catch a nap if you can while sitting on a bed of nails.  Service was great but that is the only positive thing I can say about the flight.
15854,"So much hate for this plane...  Sure, it's older and a bit shabby.  Then again, I had one of the only 2 ""green"" seats.  23F has no seat in front of it, so loads of legroom.  Underseat storage under 21F.  The row DOES recline.  Even with the armrest/tray the seat felt wider than similar Boeing seats.  Maybe it isn't, but felt like it, but then, I'm just ""American-sized,"" not super-fat.  I had this on a 4hr DFW-SFO flight and was comfortable enough to sleep the whole way."
15855,This seat and the entire row 5 has excellent leg room. The lower part of the bulkhead shifts forward to allow excellent leg room.
15856,1D from ORD to PHL. Good width and better than expected legroom for a bulkhead seat. Wouldn't hesitate to book into a bulkhead seat on this aircraft type in the future.
15857,"The seats are pretty new, however, the seat reclined minimally.  Maybe about 5 degrees at most.  Barely moved.  Seems many of the other seats were the same.  The headrest did not move nor had those side wings that can hold your head while you sleep.  The seat had no electronics (no radio/no tv).  For a 5 hour red-eye flight this was a nightmare.  Could not sleep.  Could not recline.  Could not watch any tv nor listen to any music other than what I already have on my phone.  Horrible.  Avoid like the plague for red-eyes.  The space was fine.  I am 6' 0"" and I had sufficient space."
15858,"This aircraft is the biggest piece of junk i have had the misfortune to fly on in a long time. The seat belts are retreads from the Wrights' first aircraft apparently. Im no twig but no way i gained 8"" since the embraer 175 i just left. Thumbs down AA"
15859,"This interior is badly in need of a refresh: visibly worn (e.g., bent tray table), no power, no screen, and the seat is not comfortable. The last row has a limited recline. American can do better than this."
15860,The leg room is actually quite spacious in this seat. The major downside is that the seat does not recline because the recline button is broken and has been removed.
15861,How american Airlines can charge extra for this seat and for 22B amazes me. impossible to get comfortable in   impossible to sleep in. The worst aircraft seat ive ever sat in
15862,"Why does a plane lacking all entertainment (not even an earphone jack and old music) need ""entertainment equipment"" that takes up underseat space?  This plane is SO OLD that the windows rattle on landing.  Way past it's expiration date."
15863,Great legroom.  Narrower seat than normal because of the tray table in the armrest.  Because of the proximity to first class and the economy bulkhead overhead baggage can be a challenge (there is also emergency equipment in the overhead over the DEF side of the aircraft).  This can be further compounded by some aircraft having a sold bulkhead which prevents putting a smaller bag under the seat in front of you.  That said the pros far outweigh the cons.
15864,Great seat with a lot of leg room!
15865,There is a limited legroom due to entertainment equipment
15866,Seats were completely worn out and nasty looking. On top of that the plane was dirty too.
15867,"This was by far the best seat in Economy. unlimited leg room, close to the lavatory but not too close. Was very comfortable on the 5 hour flight to LA."
15868,Immense leg room
15869,Great seat.  Six feet of leg room.  Flight attendant sits facing you for all of 10 minutes for take off/landing.
15870,this was the most painful seat I have ever had. I am  a big guy and the solid armrests were like a torture device the whole flight
15871,On a321s.  Bad seat.  No under storage and no tv screen. Limited overhead space
15872,"If you want more behind in your face than the nation's leading proctologist, or a free lapdance by a 300lb passenger, then this is your seat. Because of the aisle location kitty corner behind the bathroom and the wide leg room that I paid $69 for, every person who was in line for the can decided they'd just cozy in with me in my legroom space and put their behinds in my face while waiting their turn. And a few who were stuck in the aisle used my overhead to steady themselves, with arms upraised and bellies hanging out, without apparent recent bathing or use of deoderant. Horrible choice of seats. However, it does discourage you to use the head after you've seen the clowns that line up to use it. I'd rather hold it for the 5 hour flight."
15873,Seat has restricted legroom and floor storage due to the livesaver compartment of seat 5A That reduces floor storage width. Plane does not has entrainment serices such as tv.
15874,"This seat was way too close to the lavatory.  Expect the light to be super bright and go off every 5 seconds when someone goes in or out of the restroom.  Just paid $32 for a seat on my next flight, since this was the only other aisle seat available."
15875,"Flew the LAX-CLT route. Seat 10A,B,C are great seats, exit row with no seat in front, plenty of leg room. 10B has an emergency box blocking the underseat storage, doesnt affect leg room.  9E, D are great seats also, no row in front of them, there is a crew member jump seat next to 9D but it doesnt interferre.  These are all exit rows so arm rests are fixed with tray table fold out, slightly restricts width."
15876,First class seats barely recline - not worth  paying for on a redeye.
15877,"Despite the fact that the seat was actually wider and with better pitch than the 787-9 I transferred from in DFW, this seat ended up being sooo uncomfortable. Saggy bottom, no lower back support. This is a tired old ex-USAirways jet that they inherited. The new logo is literally glued on top of the old USAir logo on the bulkheads. Dirty and sparse, this is not an aircraft a modern North American carrier should be flying anymore. Will avoid in future."
15878,"I am 6'2"" 250lbs so need to take first class on many carriers, so I have been a platinum exec elite status with AA for many years, but no more! These AA LAS-MIA red-eye flights had the most miserable first-class seating imaginable.  AA did the usual bait-and-switch with equipment; what was supposed to be a AA32B V1 with lie-flat seats, was replaced by this US Airways torture chamber.  Seats were hard, back-breaking nightmares. No power outlets, no conveniences expected of a 5-hour first-class flight.  I once had to fly LAS-MIA on Frontier Air and found their hard-plastic seats, at one fifth the price, were more comfortable than the AA 321 V3 first class."
15879,This seat and 15C on an A321 has more leg room since there is no IFE unit.
15880,"This plane not the MD-80 is the true flying fossil. TAKE CAUTION- CHOOSE OTHER PLANE AT ALL COSTS. No IFE, radio, or power. SOOO BAD. Curse you US Airways for this plane that is now flying for American."
15881,Lights from bathroom can be very bothersome. Recommend sitting in 10A & F or 23A over this if possible. 23F is only suitable for during the day flights
15882,"Although the window was misaligned, I could still see through it by leaning a bit forward. I was very surprised when I boarded this former US Airways bird, it was fitted with the new American seat cover instead of the old blue seat covers. I could tell they were the same seats because they still had the same padding and comfort as the ones from older US Airways aircraft. It smelled like new and it was nice to see that American is making an effort to fit this older birds with the new seat covers. No seatback IFE, however, it was available at no cost in laptops and other electronic devices (which I think it's way better, it gives it a more personal touch). Overall, excellent flight!"
15883,Just flew PHX-DFW.  Seat was fine for the 2 hour flight.  No IFE or wi-fi for this flight.  The 6F window did not appear to be mis-aligned.
15884,This is a horrible seat. Behind a reclining exit row with no space and there is a box or something in the foot area. So you cannot place a carry on under the seat and there is space on for you left foot to extend as the right side is the with the box.
15885,"The first class cabin on the plane conforms with my findings on virtually every US Air configured plane - passenger comfort is not the main priority.  The seat width is fine however, the distance between the seats is narrow, especially if the seatback in front of you is reclined.  Seat is also hard and after an about an hour, my back and bottom was complaining."
15886,"Standard seat, with tremendous legroom. Although it's stated on this site that there is no storage under the seat in front of you, that is somewhat untrue. There is no  F seat in row 9, however you can place your bag under seat 8F. Overall, great seat. Awesome legroom."
15887,"Horrible seat! no recline. Extremely limited leg space. My laptop is hanging on to my lap as it did not fit the tray. Truly Cattle carrier. If this is the future of American air carrier's seat map, I should hang my traveling boots."
15888,Seat does not recline...  possibly broken.  Crew seemed to know it did not recline.
15889,Very very poor seat cushioning and reclining for a 1st class seat.
15890,"First class seats were poorly padded and very uncomfortable. I had to fold the provided blanket and use it for additional seat padding. I've never flown on an aircraft this uncomfortable, and I'll certainly remember American's ""new and improved"" seats the next time I book a flight."
15891,"The tail registration on my flight indicated that this aircraft was only 18 months old. Despite being new, the seats were unbearably uncomfortable. This is the first flight where I've seen the aisles nearly full of passengers for most of the flight."
15892,"Only a short flight from LAS-CLT , but a great seat for it.  endless legroom, and unlike the main note for this seat it does have unseat storage under 8A,  10C has the same under 8C, but 10B doesn't, its blocked by a box behind 8B.

Good view in front of the wing to watch America pass by beneath."
15893,"Seat 5A is a bulkhead seat. Unlike some of the newer planes, the partition when all the way to the floor, so there was no room to put a personal item under the first class seat in front of you.  There was a little more legroom that the traditional seat, though.  Overall, it was fairly comfortable.  My flight from Charlotte to Orlando did have wi-fi."
15894,"Wow, when they say narrow, they mean NARROW, this is the narrowest seat I've ever sat in, and I've flown spirit. If you're over 200, seriously consider looking elsewhere."
15895,"The seat in front reclined so far back, I had less than a foot of room between me and the seat. Also, the seat's entertainment screen would cut in and out and had very grainy video."
15896,"Awful seats. Have never been more uncomfortable for a red eye flight. Didn't sleep at all. Barely recline. What's worse, paid extra! American has also lost their attention to detail. Used to fly them years ago. Thought I'd try them again. Very dissaponting."
15897,"PHX to ORD, really nice flight. The window is not misallined. I am used to no IFE on long flights. Wi-Fi worked very well. Five stars out of five stars. Good job American"
15898,"The seat is very tight, so if your a little over weight you will be more comfortable is another option."
15899,"The left armrest for seat 22B did move up, so I was able to raise it and turn so my legs were towards the exit door.  For 22C, the armrests do not move, and you get the additional bumps from people boarding and also waiting for the restroom."
15900,"I flew This Plane from SFO to both PHX and CLT. For the 1.5Hr Flight to Phoenix, the fact that there is no IFE is fine because the flight is relatively short. But when Flying on a 5hr flight Transcon with NO IFE? I dont Think So! And Of course, on my return from CLT, the flight was DELAYED NOT 1, Not 2, Not 3, But 4 HOURS! What is wrong WIth American Airlines. They really need to upgrade these AGING A321 aircraft from US Airways to the new Config with IFE and power."
15901,"22C should be rated a BAD seat. As the comments say, it is far narrower than the standard seats on the plane, it doesn't recline, the armrest doesn't move, there is no floor storage, AND the overhead compartments are small because they contain equipment. The supposedly redeeming quality is that it has extra legroom because it's an exit row seat, BUT the legroom is in front of the door to the lavatory, so if you stretch out your legs, people going to the lav trip over your feet. So it's difficult to take advantage of the extra legroom. Probably the worst seat I've ever had on an airplane."
15902,"good legroom, 2 windows avaliable. No IFE"
15903,"This was THE WORST FLIGHT I have ever taken. The seat was cramped, even for a small person. I smelled lav whole flight. FA's were probably the worst at AA. OLD plane. Expensive wifi, no IFE. My sister in seat 20A didnt have much better of an experience. Never Again will I fly American Airlines"
15904,lOTS OF fwd room and recline is good. IFE screen in armrest was good and did not have to worry about person in front of me reclining seat
15905,The strange airbags attached to the seat belt is very uncomfortable and further confines the already smaller seat with due to the tray in the arm rest.
15906,"Armrest is not movable on this aircraft.  I have TWO tray tables.  One on the back of seat 22C, and one in the armrest."
15907,"I was a little disappointed for my first flight in a first class seat.  It was a red-eye flight, which is why I cashed in some miles to try out first class, hoping to get a better experience than coach.  While the seats are definitely wider and there's more legroom that coach, the seat didn't seem to be that much more comfortable.  Recline?  Not more than a couple of inches.  No power, no in-flight entertainment, either.  I guess I was looking for a little more comfort in first class."
15908,"Seat Legroom:  Outstanding legroom as there is no seat in front of you.
Seat Recline:  Perhaps the seat I got was faulty, but there was minimal recline
Seat Width:  Narrower than the standard seat because the seat tray is built into the armrest.  Both armrests are immovable. 
There is one window that is positioned just  a bit forward of the shoulders when sitting back in the seat.  There is an emergency exit door in-line with row 22, but row 23 is not cold on your feet.  
Things to be aware of:  if you are flying on a red-eye, the bathroom in that area is bothersome, not because of the noise, but because when the door opens the light shines right down on row 22DE and 23DEF.  I found it to be an annoyance, and would probable choose 23A next time I have the option."
15909,"This was a US Airways aircraft but, it was still comfortable. Flight crew was very nice and the recline was pretty good for economy class. The window is not misaligned. I say grab this seat if you can. Five stars out of five stars."
15910,"This preferred seat has a box of some sort on the left side so a medium backpack or laptop bag will not fit there and you will have to put it in the overhead storage. Additionally, you cannot fully stretch out sue to the placement of the box. It is MUCH more intrusive than the boxes on the latest 321B or next gen 737-800's so avoid this seat if you can help it. Luckily, with elite status I didn't have to pay for this seat but would have far more dissappinted if i had."
15911,Very restricted leg room on all seats the the entertainment box under the seat in front of you.
15912,"Flew this trans-continental flight from CLT to SEA. This is a former US Airways aircraft not yet upgraded. Nonethless, seat was comfortable for the 4h45min flight, good pitch by modern standards, no soreness in the rear-end, unlike some of the newer ""slim"" seats found on upgraded hard product. Yes, it lacks modern entertainment features like IFE or power, but the comfort is more important for a longer flight."
15913,"All A321 V3s in American's fleet are ex-US Airways aircraft, so they are not updated like the 321Bs. Nonetheless, the seat was still comfortable and had plenty of legroom. The lavatory in the middle of the aircraft helps reduce the number of passengers standing in the aisle toward the rear. No seatback IFE or power ports though."
15914,BE WARNED: Even though American Airlines will tell you seats 10D and 10E are exit row seats on this aircraft they are only regular economy seats with no extra legroom.
15915,"Plane seemed brand new, seat comfortable and plenty of space in overhead bins. Tray table was solid, with no signs of drooping like you get on older planes."
15916,"I've seen SeatGuru comments for other planes which say the exit or bulkhead seats are narrower, when the only difference is that the in-armrest tray tables mean you lose the inch of space under the armrest in other rows.  That's not the case here - all 4 seats in row 22 really are narrower than the rows behind them.  Plus you lose the under-armrest space.  It's mitigated a bit by the fact that the missing window seat means both passengers can lean away from each other, but this is definitely a seat for skinnier folks.  Or tall ones, the legroom is great.

The Seatguru comments are correct that 22 B/C have no underseat storage, but they are wrong when they say the same for 22 D/E.  Those seats have no bulkhead (but still have ample legroom), and can store bags under the row 21 seats.  For that reason, if I were choosing row 22, I would prefer the D or E seat."
15917,"Great legroom, seat leaned back nicely. Not the most comfortable seat though."
15918,"I disagree with the unfavorable comments about this plane. I flew recently from DFW-LAS and found the seat comfortable with plenty of legroom and I'm 6'4"". On a later return flight was seated in 31A and it was fine too. AA is copying Spirit tho and charge for Wifi, bags etc."
15919,"May 2016 - This is First Class?  When was the last time you didn't have a power outlet in First Class?   Or a seat that BARELY reclined (about 1"")?  Or only 34"" of legroom (same as coach on Jet Blue).  Hopefully AA reconfigures these ex-US Air dinosaurs.  Until then, just be aware...this is not First Class or even close to it."
15920,"this seat is sold as an extra value due to extended let room...  it has lots of leg room but the seat itself is very uncomfortable.   It has fixed sides and does not recline but the worst think is the seat width.   I had a tape measure wit h me and it is only 16 3/8 inched wide.   I remember when the Florida Gators reduced the space allowed to seat spots in their stadium from 19 inches to 15 to increase the capacity of the stadium,  well at least there you could hope for a no-shown or a couple of skinnies.   but on this plane there is no home you will need a shoe horn to get in (unless you are Barney 
Fifth)    I is upsetting that American considers this an extra value seat when it is rally the punishment row... and they charge extra."
15921,"This seat cost $65 extra and it made the flight bearable, but it's the most uncomfortable plane I've ever flown. No padding in seat, actually painful. Seats 10D and E are sold as exit row seats but 9D and E were right on top of them and make the term exit row a bad joke. I have never been this uncomfortable on Delta and will definitely be avoiding American's A321 after this!"
15922,"This seat was not in the Main Cabin Extra as indicated when booking the tickets. I was glad there was noone in the middle seat or it would have been a misreable flight. The person assigned the middle found another seat, as i am a big guy. The seat belts were also smaller than a Boeing, but just enough to not need a extension. The leg room was barely adequate. If the flight was longer than 1 1/2 hours I would have been very upset."
15923,"These seats were right out of the 50's and they took all of the entertainment out of the plane - both first class and economy - worst 5 hours - food was good though. 
Book Delta"
15924,"How do people hate this plane, flew PHX to MCO, thought it was a great flight. Had 2 windows, sure it did not have any tv's but still it was a great flight. Definetly better than Delta Airlines."
15925,"This plane is awful.  Total USAIR stock, with sub-AA-standard flight crew, and packed to the gills.  Seat 22D is excellent if you need extra leg room, have the body width of a small, starved child, want 5 hours of non-stop odor, and want to be constantly trampled by the 187 people fighting to use the lav. Seriously. The only good thing about this seat at all is the leg room.  The rest...horrible."
15926,"Partition wall behind row 8 on the A-C side so no underseat storage for 10A-C, first aid box blocking 9E underseat storage and jumpseat in fron of 10F. 9D appears to have underseat storage space but the passenger isnt using it and might be restricted due to the door of the first aid box."
15927,"This is the worst possible plane for a cross-country flight. It reminds me of the old M80s in its bare-bones structure and amenities. The seats, even in first class, barely recline, and I swear there is less leg room than I'm used to in first class (other than M80s)because I haven't grown or gained a pound and my seat mate--a normal-sized woman--had to get up to let me out since there was not even six inches between our knees and the seat in front of us. There is no entertainment for a six-hour flight, though one can connect to AA's on board WiFi to download AA's selection of movies on their own devices that support it. So, bring your laptop, iPad, iPhone or Android (though who wants to watch a movie on a phone?) if you want any in-flight entertainment.My Kindle Fire couldn't support it, and my Android screen was just too small to enjoy it."
15928,"The tray table does not extend fully to the armrest, meaning it is not level for doing work. Also it extends just enough to the arm rest to rest on it and then snap down when you put an arm or computer on it. Very annoying."
15929,Leg room was restricted because of equipment under 6A
15930,Technically it is an exit row seat but behind the main exit row so no real additional leg room
15931,"Very little recline on any of the first class seats.  No place to put your handbags as this is the front row.  No TV screen, no foot-rest.  Hardly what you would expect for a cross-country first-class seat."
15932,"Very little recline on this seat as the coats are hung behind it.  No TV screen, no foot-rest.  Hardly what you would expect for a cross-country first-class seat."
15933,"Really a bare-bones First Class.  No enertainment screen, no power outlet, limited recline seat. I was very surprised. And the charge for wifi access was outrageous. They offered streaming service for some grade-B movies, at a cost of $5.99! And if you device needs charging, tough luck -- no power outlet."
15934,"Great legroom in 23F. You can store a small bag under 21F, but you can't reach it while seated. It takes a while to deplane since you are in back, but if you want to stretch out your legs, and have no one relining into your space, it is a good choice."
15935,"Terrible seat for First Class, same for the remaining 15 seats. Hard, minimum recline for First Class, no entertainment at all, no electrical outlets, no pillows considering we were flying overnight from LAX to CLT. The 32Bs we flew from KOA-LAX was excellent in every way in comparison."
15936,"Typical middle seat. A little bit of room to cross my legs (I'm 6'3"") so that was nice. This aircraft has no power or entertainment systems on board."
15937,Decent legroom even with the jerk in 5c reclined. This aircraft has no power or entertainment onboard. Not what I would expect these days on a four hour fight from CLT to LAX.
15938,"LAX-HNL I've been flying in first class with American for 25 year or so.  I've watched first class gradually decline in terms of seats and service.  The seat was really uncomfortable, I had to put the pillow behind my lower back for some lunar support, and the bottom of the seat is very hard.  The crew was almost surly, certainly not welcoming or accommodating.  While you still have more leg room and you get served a mediocre meal, this is one of the worst first class seats I've flown in."
15939,"Absolutely the worst first class seat and service we've ever experienced. Prior to boarding had just flown over 11,000 miles with AA and partner HA--All other bus/first were EXCELLENT..NO service and no COFFEE prior to landing in CLT @ 8AM..---This is most disappointing AA flight EVER!!!"
15940,"Flew ATL to LAX over thanksgiving. This was, hands-down, the most uncomfortable flight I can remember. No in-flight entertainment as many of the seat-back screens did not work. Nearly impossible to retrieve anything that fell on the floor or get to a bag stored under seat in front because the seat in front of you is so close. I will take this aircraft model into account before booking another flight on American."
15941,"Flew on Dec/22/15. It was a 5 hour long flight. No seat recline at all. Not even a full inch. No onboard entertainment at all. Not even audio. This aircraft is being widely used by AA on Phoenix routes, long and short ones (which I took on the same night on a first class 'as bad' seat. I advise caution before booking on advertised A321s."
15942,Absurdly uncomfortable. Literally almost no seat recline at all. No entertainment either. Too unbearable for flights over 3 hours long.
15943,Absurdly unconfortable. No recline at all. No kind of entertainment as advertised and displayed on SeatGuru. Too umberable for a flight longer than 3 hours.
15944,"Poor leg room, even worse than a regular seat as you can not stretch (I'm 6'2). Has plenty of knee room though. Sold as a Main Cabin Extra seat, but not worth the money."
15945,I flew 12/8/15 from PHX to DEN.  10A was well worth the nominal upgrade cost.  I did not find it colder near the exit door and did not find the narrower seat (due to the tray table in the armrest) to be an issue.  The flight attendant agreed that it's one of the best seats on the aircraft.  You can stow an item under the window seat in the row in front of you.  The only real complaint is that the Airbus 320 & 321 are very noisey when the thrust reverers are used on landing.  The overhead bins rattle unlike anything I've heard on any other aircraft.
15946,"There is no in-flight entertainment system unless you use your own device/laptop and pay for access to films shown on the plane's wifi.  There are also no powers plugs.  This is acceptable for short flights but not great for longer flights (e.g., my 5 hour flight from JFK to PHX)."
15947,"Plenty of leg room but seats are more than ""a bit"" narrower because of the tray table in the arm rest.  Big guys and plus size women would not be happy sitting more than a couple of hours in this seat.  Very confining."
15948,"9D and 9E both recline. There is space under the seats ahead, though you need to stand up to reach them and they may be used by the flight attendants. Can get cold near exit door during flight and people tend to want to stand in the space which can be annoying. With the fixed arm rests, this would uncomfortable for a larger person. Smaller overhead bin available above but can't fit rollers (oxygen bottle mounted takes up space)."
15949,"I flew on this aircraft from San Francisco (SFO) to Phoenix (PHX). When I flew on this aircraft U.S. airways' last flight had only been 2 weeks prior, so while the plane still had a U.S. airways livery. This aircraft was old and worn, the seats were torn and the air conditioning barely worked ( it also made an awful whistling noise). While the aircraft's condition left much to be desired, the plane's layout was much better than what most planes have. I am 5 9"" but my knees did not even come close to touching the seat in front of me. Overall I would say good layout, bad condition 3/5 stars"
15950,"Worst First Class seat ever, If this is the last first class seat available save yourself the extra money and just book a economy seat.  No power, seat doesn't fully recline, no free wifi or movies for first class passengers"
15951,Seat is narrower than usual fixed-armrest. If you want exit row choose 22E instead - no window seat and regular armrest.
15952,"I flew on this aircraft on 11/7/15. It is an older aircraft, formerly an older US Airways. This seat was fine, however upholstery was aged and in poor shape."
15953,"Although this seat is listed as a normal first class, lie flat seat, the flight attendant closet is directly behind between first and business on the A321T. I found myself jolted awake from the FAs slamming the closet throughout the flight. I would change its category based on this annoyance."
15954,"Row 11 is an exit and 1st row of the main cabin. Seats 11 D/E/F have evev more than legroom than 11 A/B/C - more than 4 feet for the DEF compared to maybe 3 feet for AB and C. No underseat storage for any of the row 11 seats, but not a problem - there’s plenty of overhead storage for these seats."
15955,"Media box under seat in front, reducing underseat storage/leg space"
15956,Row 6 in American business class has shorter leg room than the other rows. There is reduced space in the foot well.
15957,"I think this is the best seat in business class because (based on my flight) the meal service (which was rather slow) goes from the front to the back, so this seat gets served relatively soon; however it's also not right up against the sounds & lights from the gallery / lavatory. Flew from JFK->LAX. Even though it's a domestic flight this seat comes with Flagship lounge access and it's a nice lounge. On board I got the European cold breakfast and thought it was fantastic. The seats and blanket were more comfortable than I expected and the window seat allowed me to snooze undisturbed in my little flat cocoon for the majority of the flight."
15958,"The lie flat seats are very comfortable in Business, but I had a not so great meal on this flight - beef, which was either over-cooked or a less than prime cut. The starter snack of mixed nuts was a bit stale/ lacking in flavor. Also the video setup/process is awkward.  I wanted to watch a film at the start of the flight, but the crew didn't pass out the BOSE headsets immediately.  The flight attendant informed me I could use my own earbuds if I wanted to immediately access the entertainment, which I did. Further, the area to plug in is in a dark little cubbyhole at the rear of your seat. I saw a couple using their Iphone's flashlight to figure out where to plug in. My seatmate grumbled that American  wants to ensure that you don't steal the Bose headsets, given its awkwardly configured plug."
15959,"You should note that all of the row 6 seats, especially C and D do not go as far back in terms of room as other business class seats."
15960,"When we booked this flight (paying $1800 for Business/First seats, we were led to believe we would be in layflat seats but when we entered the plane there were only 12 first class seats that were so ordinary and cramped together, they were nowhere near as good as Premium economy on a 777."
15961,"Basic economy has so little legroom that your   your face is too close to the video screen in the seat back in front. Also, the front of this aircraft A321) was a good 10 degrees warmer than the back. When I asked the flight attendants (sitting in the back galley) if they could adjust it, they just looked at me blankly and said its the aircraft - they hate going up front too."
15962,"Good legroom, terrible width, and an extremely uncomfortable seat overall. The width is actually quite shocking and the recline was completely insufficient. I found it more comfortable sitting upfront that using the recline. I'd recommend sitting in a different seat within Main Cabin Extra."
15963,11f (and a) are not bad seats! At minimum they are mixed. The only downside is the missing window but 11f has about 6' of unobstructed legroom and 11a has about 3'. I would consider these good seats and get them every time. The missing window is actually better for sleeping because it is less awkward to lean against.
15964,"For a red-eye, the Main Cabin Extra seats are the only viable Economy option. The knee crunchers in row 17 and up are impossible seats for overnight sleeping. In row 13, at least, both the center and window seats have utility boxes that reduce legroom so stick to the aisle if you want a full, under-seat space for your legs."
15965,"Terrible flight, actually excruciating.  I've had two back surgeries, and can't sit up straight.  I always book premium coach seats so I get more recline.  But this flight had only about two inches of recline.  And it seems to be impossible to find out the amount of recline in advance. After 45 years, it looks like no more American for me."
15966,"This seat has fantstic legroom though there is a crew seat across that was occupied during takeoff and landing.  However, 11D was several (at least 2 and maybe 3 inches narrower than 11E and 11F.  Would not recommend sitting here if you have a choice.  Very uncomfortable.  Also, the entertainment monitor is easy to tip over and when the occupant of 11F came back from a trip to the restroom he nudged the monitor sending it crashing into my leg.  There needs to be a lock in the upright position to prevent this from happening."
15967,I dont believe this is a standard seat.  I think width is reduced and right arm rest is lower than left. This is not a desirable seat.
15968,"Although my companion and I did not request an upgrade, presumably because I am EXP, we were upgraded to 1st at the gate (Seats 3A & 3F).  I usually fly J on AA's transcon routes, and the F seat and the IFE system felt exactly like those in J, with the exception that you have a lot more (not-so-usable) storage space in F.  From what I could tell from the menus, the food offering, too, was pretty much identical. I was disappointed that I was unable to readily communicate with my companion because of the physical separation in F, and we would have strongly preferred to remain in J.  All in all, unless you are traveling alone and don't want anybody near you, I don't see a reason to choose F over J on this plane."
15969,"I fly a lot so Im frequently in First, This a/c in First, it absolutely the WORST. All seats in First are on an odd angle, No chance of relaxing on take off or landing to see out the window, its just not possible. Restricted Movement in General, Main cabin extra is must Nicer. I now avoid the 321 AT ALL COST!"
15970,I've flown this plane multiple times in both first and business class. Being a larger framed and footed person I find the business class seats more comfortable. First class comes with many hard cabinet surfaces which restrict movement and comfort. I found it very hard to lay down and be comfortable.
15971,"This is a great seat, tech is very nice, comfortable, and very roomy.  Plane boards at the very front.  I had ""Dine & Rest"" so only water bottle pre-flight but Grilled Lobster and Cheese sandwich meal was nice. Kitchen can be a little loud, but not too bad.  Did LAX-JFK 9:00pm-5:30am.  I was actually in the pod next to Heidi Klum, which was sweet.  She was traveling to film America's Got Talent in NYC!  I love the Flagship International Lounge access this provides, especially if you are using a connection you get to use it again (LAX and JFK for me!).  Saw James Corden at JFK's.  Too cool."
15972,Foot area has a power box occupying approximately 25% of footspace to the left
15973,This is regular economy being sold as premium.  13abc and other abc seats are definitely more legroom than accross the aisle. Man sitting next to me in 13e has regular economy ticket. Ours has priority on it but the seat is not priority/ premium economy.  Stewardess says they are kust lined up differently. This is correct. There are more rows on cde than on abc.  This is a scam!
15974,"As context, I fly only 50,000 - 70,000 miles each year, but it is usually 3-4 lax to lhr trips combined with some x-country flights (lax - jfk, lax to iad). For the international flights I always fly on the 777,  which has a somewhat similar configuration to the A321. Although the actual seat in business class is similar in the A321 and the 777, the configuration in the 777 gives each business class seat aisle access without disturbing any other passengers.

I have flown in this configuration several times and think it is the best long-haul domestic offering of the major airlines. I was fortunate on my flight that the IFE in the adjacent seat was not working so they did not seat anyone in that seat allowing me to get up and down as I pleased without disturbing anyone."
15975,"As context, I fly only 50,000 - 70,000 miles each year, but it is usually 3-4 lax to lhr trips combined with some x-country flights (lax - jfk, lax to iad).

Although the actual seat in business class is similar in the A321 and the 777, the configuration in the 777 gives each business class seat aisle access without disturbing any other passengers.

Had to book late on a lax - jfk red-eye so my upgrade request was put in really late; however, it would not have mattered as the flight was packed and none of the 18 people on the upgrade list cleared. I have only platinum status and I am sure many on the list that did not clear were executive platinum.

With that as context I am reviewing seat 11b. I do not have to pay for the premium seats and at the time of booking had selected 14D, which is an aisle seat in MCE. I decided to change seats to 11b even though it is a middle seat because it is a bulkhead seat with ample leg room. The leg room is substantial, but the width is more than slightly reduced by the tray in the armrest. The middle and aisle seats in this row have both armrests with trays and it seemed like the width was almost a full inch less. The flight was brutal with very little sleep.

One small consolation is that the armrests go all the way to the seat, which was crucial for me on this flight as the passengers on my right and left were enormous. Had the armrest been standard they would have been overflowing into my seat. Did not stop the guy in the window seat from farting all night with some of the worst smells I have ever encountered. Fortunately the flight home the next night was pretty empty and my upgrade cleared early. The IFE for the business class seat next to me was broken so no one was seated there so extra bonus for the pain from this flight."
15976,"C'mon, row 11 is by far the best place in the main cabin (B & E being slightly worse because they're middle seats).  Why?  The incredible legroom!  Who cares about no big window, or any other nit-picks mentioned here, they're all trumped by that first-class legroom."
15977,Excellent seat. Lots of legroom. AA provides blankets on this service.  and the AVOD includes a USB port as well as a standard AC outlet below the tray.  It took me awhile to find it but look for the green light.
15978,I sat in seat 8a on the way there and seat 3f on the way back. Both were very good. if you are traveling with somebody I would highly suggest business over first. Unless you need a lot more space its really not worth the updrade. Had i sat next to someone horrible maybe i'd feel differently as you are close together but certainly far enough. Even alone I would book business unless they were very close in price. Also the ice cream was amazing.
15979,"To say ""proximity to galley and lavatory may be bothersome"" is a bit of an understatement when it comes to a redeye.  The cabin crew did not stop talking, and the light was really bothersome.   This is true for both seats, but especially 6D.  Probably the other side too."
15980,"I think that AA has the nicest seat in the transcon market. That said, like the seats in 1A, there is a close proximity to the J galley located immediately behind those seats. Since the seats angle forward and towards the windows, light is NOT an issue, just loud noises from the galley. If you have a particularly robust Flight Attendant, you can hear slamming and feel banging in the galley during service."
15981,"Okay, this is a half-and-half seat: some parts [width and length] like a regular lie-flat business class seat and some parts [storage, entertainment screen, amenities (albeit on this flight nowhere near world travel standards, and privacy] like lie-flat first class.  I am 6'7"", so it was a tight squeeze for me, particularly the feet.  It's a little narrow, so moving around is not the easiest.  Getting in and out of these seats is a little tricky as there is not much actual floor level space for entry - best if you kind of step over and in.  that said, you cannot beat lie-flat for transcon and sleep.  Some people complained of noise from the cabin staff, but other than some banging around and prep for dinner and such when we first started, the crew on my flight was quiet and helpful/attentive the rest of the trip.  Service is like world first class, which was nice and added to the relaxing attitude of the overnight flight.  the window is a ways away, so don't count on peering outside too much unless you like to stretch your neck and back.  This seat has an added bonus - no one behind to kick or move things to affect your sleep or relaxation and the person in front doesn't seem to have any real impact when he/she moves.  Overall, it was worth the price for me..."
15982,"Seat 5A on the AA A321 transcon is a great hard product seat, but two issues make this more of a ""yellow"" seat to avoid in first class. First, it's connected to the wall behind it and flight attendants throughout my transcon redeye slammed shut a storage compartment waking me up almost 5 minutes after falling asleep. Happened almost every hour and was really annoying. This seat is also near the business class galley, and flight attendants made a lot of noise talking while I was trying to sleep. If you have a choice in first class, avoid 5A and pick a different seat."
15983,This plane is awesomw.  The configuration is perfect.  I loved flying to NYC on it.  So comfortable and private. The amenities are so passenger friendly.   I am not a good passenger and not once was I scared.  The  service was outstanding as were the pilots.  Even when we had some turbulence the pilot managed to circumvent it.  Here's to American Airlines!  ????
15984,"Awesome seat, and awesome service.  The Flagship experience is truly something else!"
15985,In additon the over head storage for row 11 is greatly reduced.   Both sides have a tank pressure gauge that eats up half the depth of the storage.   Quite silly since the bulkheads require everything be stored up top.  There is not enough room for the six seats..   Better board early
15986,"This is a standard business class seat, but it is missing a window (seat only has one window; all other seats in biz have 2). This seems to be because of the way the plane is configured/built  there is a blank space of wall where there should be a window."
15987,"AWFUL FLIGHT. I flew from JFK to LAX, 6 hour flight. Reclined about 2.5"", seat cushion felt like a blanket over a cardboard box. Legroom was severely compromised when the seat infront of you reclined. Also, there was this one fligjt attendant THAT WOULD NOT LEAVE ME ALONE! I asked her why, and she said ""you look cool."" seriously (I am 6' 2"" with generously sized biceps [and muscles in general])? Man, the return flight on Jetblue A321 in seat 19a was SOOOOOO much better!"
15988,"American's A321's are good planes. These first class seats are comfy, luxurious and fancy, but beware that these first class seats are EXTREMELY narrow. Red eye flight JFK to LAX, tried to sleep, but I couldn't really fit (I am 6, 3"" and in fantastic shape with big biceps)! The service wasn't too good. Jetblue MINT flight on return was much better; cheaper, nicer FA's, an IFE that worked and an EXCELLENT seat. Ifnyou are flying transcon, take the MINT."
15989,"The first class seat on this 321 is basically the same as business class on AA's 777, but with even less space between the footrest and the partition behind the seat in front of you. That space is so restricted that I caught my shoe in it while initially taking my seat, twisting my ankle. First class on AA's 321 is not at all comparable to the very spacious accommodations on the 777. Otherwise, the food and service on this flight were exemplary. Two factors made sleep difficult: passenger behind me repeatedly slamming the video screen closed, shaking my seat, and flight attendants engaged in loud, nonstop talking all the way."
15990,"Had the chance to sit in 10A on JFK-LAX. First time on the AA A321 Transcon.  Some key thoughts:

-Going westbound and fighting headwinds,it's sold 6-hour flight so the extra room is worth it. The seat does indeed lie flat.  The pillows are average, and the blanket is well-above average.  The complimentary Bose noise canceling headphones are dynamite and work fine.

-This is a full lie-flat seat.  It's business class, but feels much like an int'l first-class seat for sure.

-We received options of champaign, OJ, or water before takeoff, plus a menu.  Three options were a cheese/fruit plate, Chicken Sliders, or Crab cakes.  Hot rolls were included and replaced when needed.  Ice cream was included as well.

-Screen is very large, though takes a while to learn how to use, but terrific option of movies, music, HBO, maps, in-flight info with multi-views.

-We had 2 FA's for the business section and it really felt like a private cabin.    Lots of drinks and snacks.

-I'd give an A+ to the seat.  For a flight of 6+ hours, it's worth it. (I'm 6-1, 185) so a bit above average, but you can lay on your side...privacy from other person, and nice ottoman area for your feet.

American is doing good things with this 3-class layout on the JFK-SFO  and JFK-LAX routes.  It was a full plane, but didn't feel like it whatsoever."
15991,"I've flown the LAX/JFK route several times and have a different opinion of this seat. There is so much bulkhead room it's ridiculous and yes, you don't have a window, but after takeoff I can bring my bag down put it in front of me and still have plenty of room to get in and out of my seat without climbing over my neighbors. As a result, I can get more work done in this seat than anywhere else in the main cabin."
15992,"I hadn't flown the SFO-JFK route in a while and needed to use some miles before they expired.  I have to say, the layout of this plane is fantastic.  The Main Cabin Extra seats have tons of legroom and a wider seat.  Memories of how much room there used to be in coach.  I see some people are complaining about the content on the screen in front of them.  If you do any regular travel, I would strongly recommend buying a tablet and bringing your own content"
15993,I love this aircraft.  Especially for first class and business class seats.  I flew first class into JFK and then business class on the return to LAX.  The seats in both cabins are very comfortable and loaded with what most airlines only use on their international flights.  I walked through the entire plane and really saw an aircraft that internally was designed for passenger comfort.  It's too bad that American only uses this aircraft and configuration out of JFK to LAX/SFO since I would like to see it used on all nonstop long haul transcon flights to BOS PHL & DCA
15994,"I have no idea why anyone used to the standard 737/757 AA planes would complain about this flight. By far the best domestic experience I have. As a not small person (6ft/225lbs) the extra width (18"" vs 17.3 boeing standard) in coach is noticeable and much more comfortable. The bow out of the plane at window seats gives you even more shoulder width, and extra pitch in MCE makes this a quite roomy seat. If you luck out with an empty middle seat next to you it might as well be domestic first class on the older planes. The only downfall are those obnoxious and obtrusive equipment boxes under the seats. I have no idea why the seat designers thought that was an appropriate solution for media content. But even though they make it impossible to stretch out both legs at once without contorting your body, the seat remains  more comfortable than other AA flights by a wide margin. 8/10"
15995,"I fly this AA transcontinental configuration every two weeks between JFK-LAX. I would never chose row 11 unless I had a broken leg in a full cast! You must stow your bag for takeoff and landing and there is no window. The only saving grace for the horrid middle seats in row 11 is that you can get up to go to the bathroom without waking the person in the aisle. If you are tall you must get main cabin extra; I would pick an isle in rows 12 through 16. (I believe these seats should be marked green on the seat map). Wifi is outrageously expensive. In the main cabin, there are no free movies, only two channels of junk. Board last call to see who may be sitting in first class."
15996,I traveled on 6/22/15 from LAX to JFK.  This flight runs late a lot of times.  I was a little nervous as I had an international connection out of JFK.  This day things went OK.  Service was excellent. I'll be back but next time I am getting an earlier flight.
15997,"seat is attached to the business class wardrobe and so around take off and landing it is noisy and rather annoying. Other than that, standard first class seat"
15998,I flew first from LAX to JFK in seat 4A on 6/22/15.  Service was fantastic and the seat was great.  I really recommend the first class.
15999,American did a wonderful job on this aircraft. This aircraft has the best transcontinental first and economy first class in the United States. Thus stating that American's A321T is the best domestic class in the era. Overall rating 10/10
16000,"I thought this plane was great. Flew SFO to JFK for the red-eye flight. I think it's the best domestic coast to coast service available today outside of a private jet. The video screen is huge and picture is sharp, with great map function. These are same business class seats used on international flights by some airlines and are quite comfy. Food and service were decent, and I enjoyed the Prosecco.  There was no noise problem from galley or bathroom, as the seat map indicates may be a concern.  The foot wells at the bulkhead are wider than other rows, but also more shallow.  Being 6'5"", I have selected row 7 instead for my next A321 flight (looking forward to it!)."
16001,The coach Recaro seats have so many ergonomic flaws from tray table height to tray table hinges to large equipment boxes under seats to seat back screens that dont tilt to power outlet placed at yoiyr knee cap to headrests that dont stay up to many more.   Recaro cannot spell Ergonomic !!! Idiots.
16002,"Insofar as the power outlet, it's easy to use, (it's on the seat back ahead of you in MCE) but you have to unplug every time the A or B seats come or go. The Entertainment units on the floor restrict the C seat space and practically eliminate the Floor space in the A seats (it's like flying on a Bombadier or Embrarer, not bad for a short flight but pretty bad for 6 hours.)"
16003,"Standard seat, but only 2 windows compared to 3 in other rows"
16004,"I have used this plane twice on ""red eye"" flights from SFO to JFK. The privacy and flat bed comfort of the A321 in first class is unequalled on this route. I awoke from a solid sleep and appreciate this upgrade by AA."
16005,"The coach seats in this cabin are restricted height, and barely comes to my shoulders (I'm 5'11"" tall, for reference), feeling like the normal non-MCE seats on most other aircraft for legroom.  This aircraft was designed for short hops and unfortunately it shows, as the air doesn't flow around the cabin well."
16006,AA is offering the best available first class transcon product today. All aisle access. Intimate 10 seat cabin. Very comfortable flat bed. Food is unremarkable. Service good for a legacy carrier. The best available product out there. JetBlue's suites on transcon flights are comparable but the cabin feels more cramped and less special. AA has a lav for first class section that seems to really be used just by the 10 pax in the F cabin. Chatter from FAs audible in row 2. Not a huge deal but a bit bothersome. I would strongly recommend avoiding row 1 because of that.
16007,"I really enjoyed this newest aircraft in American's fleet.  The first class seat is extremely comfortable and spacious.  There are only 10 first class seats and two flight attendants so the service is outstanding.  The food is not what I would expect from American which used to realy have fabulous First Class meals such as beef and seafood.  Neither are offered anymore and I did ask the flight attendant about that.  She indicated that the new president, Doug Parker has cut down on the menu selections.  The inflight entertainment is fabulous.  The give you a Bose Noise Cancelling headphone too!  It was a very good experience but the food wasn't all that great.   The warmed nuts with my drink was good and the ice cream sundae was great."
16008,"I flew business from SFO to JFK, then first JFK to SFO. First is marginally more private, but not worth the difference in price. The first seat is only a little bit wider than the business seat. They use the same bedding. Service was adequate at best (typical USA domestic service), and the food was forgettable. Business class on the  321T is definitely a better value for the money (or miles)."
16009,"I have to say the seat is an imporvement from previous seats and is a true flat bed seat. However, it's still based on the rather dated 'Window or aisle"" configuration. Only the ""first Class"" on this plane has the new Business class seats (used on their 777) with  aisle access on every seat. Food was alright but the wine list was a basic sparkling (not actual champagne), red or white. And the only red wine they had available ran out before the main course! There is also no amenity kit offered either. In other words, if you need a real business class experience, you will have to book a First Class seat on this plane. Overall this product that is heralded by AA as a breakthrough is pretyy underwhelming and the fact it's a one-aisle plane does not help either."
16010,"The arrangement of the business cabin is very efficient and pleasing.  It is a fine balance of privacy for the solo traveller and proximity for couples travelling together. 
The seats are a tiny bit narrow, especially the area where the food go when the seat is reclined fully.  The seat is still somewhat lumpy in the fully flat position. The duvet and pillow are quite nice and add to the comfort.  I was able to sleep quite comfortably for 2-3 hours.  The cabin was kept quite dark for comfort.  Food and service was very good, not spectacular.  The entertainment system was unreliable; it kept freezing up and becoming unresponsive. Bose headphones were a nice touch, but useless most of the flight.  Wifi was available but also very sporadic and weak.  (and EXPENSIVE).  
The ground people, especially in the Admirals Lounge are EXCEPTIONAl: helpful, efficient, pleasant. Business class is likely a better value for the money than first."
16011,This is a very comfortable seat.  The privacy is very nice.
16012,"Compared to my general experience of US domestic business class I was very impressed, it's comfortable (I'm not especially tall but can't see it would be a problem if you were). I slept as well as is possible on a flight. Entertainment system was excellent. Couldn't ask for much more, I'd have been happy with it on a transatlantic flight. Only complaint would be the cabin was a shade on the warm side."
16013,Not sure why people would complain about the new power outlet placement -- having the power over your shoulder gives a nice little shelf for devices as they charge and means you don't have to thread the cord from your laptop around the legrest or to the seatback pocket and have it pop out every time you change the recline or get out of your seat.
16014,"I give this plane a B.  The seats are efficiently designed given their shape with the magazine pouch up high and the sliding recline mechanism.  However, the 5 hour flight from SFO to JFK got uncomfortable with the floor-level box for the entertainment system, especially with my large bag I put under the seat.  The air was a bit stagnant for part of the flight, and as far as the TV goes, I'm glad that it was on-demand and the GPS system is amazing, but it should have a remote and there were no feature movies except for Disney.  While the personal screens are a plus compared to the 767s, I prefer the 2-3-2 seating.  The rest of my family went in Main Cabin Extra, which has a 38"" pitch but I opted out because it would've meant a wing view.  And it wasn't as comfortable as on the 737 to lean on the wall."
16015,"Most unpleasant flight I ever endured.  Took the JFK - LAX in the A321 and the coach configuration is not fit to transport human beings in any way, shape, or form.  No legroom whatsoever, unbelievably narrow.  I'll never fly American again.  That's a promise.  For a $1200 round trip, the A321 is easily the worst plane ever."
16016,Excellent plane except for the ridiculous placement of the power and audio outlets behind the seat.
16017,"I flew from JFK to SFO and the flight was fun. There were touchscreens on the plane. I was asleep for most of the flight. It wasn't that bumpy, and the seats reclined enough.I enjoyed the flight."
16018,"LAX to JFK red eye on A321. Seated in First Class seat 5F. I'm am 6'4"" and the new first class cubicle is a tight fit.  In full lie-flat position my lower half was restricted. The other features are very nice (i.e. monitor, privacy, AC outlet/USB Charger, etc.) but not ideal for sleeping if you are tall. Unless lie-flat is very important to you, it's only a slight improvement over 767."
16019,"The plane is very nice and the leg room in Row 11 is incredible for an exit row. Only complaint is the personal TV which only has TV shows. There no movies available at this time. Flight attendant told me the movies were available from January to May but they have stopped them. No movie is even played on the general monitors. Again, nice plane, but I was disappointed with the video system on the plane."
16020,"Huge improvement over the previous transcon 767 seat.  Personal TV was great, and MCE offers a lot of extra legroom (I'm nearly 6 feet).  Very comfortable flight. I'd do it again for sure."
16021,"A great way to begin our long international trip was the flight from LAX to JFK on the Airbus A321.  Although the 777 flight home from Heathrow to DFW was very comfortable, the Airbus A321 is on my wish list for every long flight."
16022,"Lav and galley are a long way forward of the seats, and there was no disturbance at all.  Two of us were in 1A and 1F, and agreed that this is by far the best transcon F in the marketplace."
16023,"This plane was a delight after an 11 hr  overnight flight on a 777 & was outstanding even without that comparison.  Seats were truly horizonal-flat,sufficiently padded & very comfortable.  Ambient lighting was subtle & relaxing. Aisle seats were angled away from the aisle & gave an unusual feeling of privacy.  The food was especially good."
16024,"If you thought it was difficult to plug into the DC / AC outlets in other aircraft, this is a whole new challenge.  In business class, they are behind the seat along with the audio and USB outlets.  You have to get out of your seat and its not lit well, so I had to use a flashlight to get all my electronics connected.  The lay flat seats are easier to sleep in than the angle flat seats in the 767 and the personal large monitor and selections are a nice improvement."
16025,"A MAJOR improvement over the old AA 767 F class.  Seat is private and comfortable. Easy access to power, headphone jacks and screen."
16026,"Main Cabin Extra gave more leg room, but the seat itself is narrow. This aircraft would be comfortable with 3+2 seating, but 3+3 is cramped. The seat reclines adequately, but its shape and thinner padding made for one of the most uncomfortable coach seats I have ever experienced. The basket is miniscule: it holds next to nothing. A big disappointment after all the hype."
16027,"I've flown on American's new transcon Airbus 321 service. I've been in business class (seat 10F), it was a good experience, the new business class is much better than American's previous business class from LAX to JFK. Thumbs up!"
16028,"The Main Cabin Extra seats are problematic.  Legroom is fine, but the PTV sticks out so much from the seatback that when the person in front of you reclines, there's almost no room to open a small laptop.  Worse, if you do open it, the top of a 13"" laptop lines up perfectly with the very touch-sensitive buttons that control the overhead light and call the flight attendant- making it a light show.  An extra inch would do the trick here, but alas, the bulkhead is your only choice if you want to get work done on this airplane (the regular Main Cabin seats are horrifically close together, forget about a laptop)."
16029,Proximity to lav and galley not really an issue. Only 10 seats in cabin and seat is slightly angled away from aisle. Best F domestic seat presently. HUGE product improvement over the 762 F offering. Now better than UA PS. DL and CO not even in the running.
16030,"The main cabin extra seats are really a joke.  I felt like I was sitting in regular economy.  The person in front of my reclined and I could not move and if I did, it rattled the seat that was reclined.  There is virtually no seat pocket so anything you want to put in there (headphones, snack, paperwork) just does not fit. Major disappointment for someone who travels frequently between JFK and LAX.  FYI - Platinum status on American."
16031,"Suffice to say, I won't fly on this particular type of aircraft again.  The seats are incredibly uncomfortable, and have reduced legroom than the Boeing planes for the same seat.  The seats are more molded in nature, with far less cushion, and for a petite person, do not hit in the right places (I had to put a pillow behind my back, so that I would have something to lean against."
16032,New plane
16033,"DON'T DO IT!  Your coccyx (tailbone) will thank you forever!  Like others have stated, this flying sardine can has very little padding on the seats and the space is confined.  WiFi on my flight never connected.  Aside from rows 1 thru 4, the ENTIRE plane is the same, don't be fooled into paying $14 for this, $23 for that;  YOU WILL be cramped in ANY seat and your rear end will not be happy at the end of the flight!"
16034,"So, I'm a Diamond on Delta and a Million Miler. Had been thinking about doing a American Airlines Challenge to try out AA. Booked this flight with the Wife to Barbados.
the room with this seat was OK because it was an Exit Row. The seat however is uncomfortable to sit in for longer than 45 minutes without having to get up and move around. I notices people in other seats  not in Exit Row we're seriously cramped.  Will think twice about booking on AA again and don't think I'll ever complain again about Delta Seats or service."
16035,Flying this plane was torture. Even with main cabin extra I felt like a sardine. I think the airline wanted to see how far they could push the envelope of cramming passengers in an airplane. It was a very unpleasant experience
16036,"I thought this seat was fine. Perfectly comfortable, did not notice it being any worse than any other older 737 I have flown on. Not having a bulkhead means you can store things under the seat of the last row of first class. True, the tray is in the armrest, which is a slight negative."
16037,"Avoid these planes while you can.  This may be the least comfortable seat Ive ever sat in on a plane.  I got up to see if I was sitting on something but unfortunately it seems as though what little padding is in these seats just happened to be all in one spot.  If you are in an aisle seat like 2B, forget about putting anything under the seat in front of you.  The seats extend nearly to the floor making it impossible to stuff even a small backpack under them.  They are also notably closer together.  Essentially American has figured out how to make domestic first class feel like economy."
16038,"This new plane sucks.  The only good thing about this plane is more overhead bin space, carryons will fit vertical.  I've only flown in the first class seats and they are worse the the old coach seats.  The seats are uncomfortable, like sitting on a board.  There is no under seat storage on the isle seats so if you want to use a laptop during flight you have to get up an get it from the overhead.  No IFE, bring your on TV.  The LAV in first class is no better than coach.  They should ban these LAVs as a form of torture.  And to top it off the oven was broken on one flight.  AA will put this plane on routes where there is no other option so we are hosed."
16039,"Awesome seat if your 3ft 2!  this is supposedly a brand new aircraft/model. seats are smaller, thinner, and amazingly uncomfortable. they look and feel cheap. infact, everything about this plane is cheap. from the NIL IFE, to the manual safety demonstrations as their aren't even any overhead screens  ( so 1970's) to the incredibly small bathroom."
16040,Terrible smell from the toilets from the rear
16041,"Probably the worst mainline first class seat flying on the AA fleet today.  Legroom is worse that the current 737-800 seat (although not by a lot) so this downgrade is almost a wash.  Where this seat truly suffers is that every surface you touch is hard plastic or metal (the arm rests, the seatback in front of you, etc., etc.) and is thus very uncomfortable.  This seat cushion is also quite hard so it is also not as comfortable as the current seat on the -800.  Couple this very poor seating environment with the lack of a lav that will accommodate a normal human, the lack of a moving map, and other downgrades, the total result is an experience that is the worst premium cabin on a mainline AA aircraft today (to be honest, I'd also rate it below the premium cabins on the Eagle fleet as well).  The only saving grace on my flight was a sterling crew...they worked very hard and did a really nice job.  If you have an option to fly a different jet, I'd take it...and I did on my return flight home."
16042,New plane feel. No IFE screens but they do have tablet holders on the seat back
16043,"Poor recline. Wasted space for extra magazines instead of a screen for viewing entertainment. If you don't have a laptop or tablet, you're out of luck. Very disappointing."
16044,"Those in the 737MAX extra section are worse then in the regular 737. Seats are harder and it seems that row separation and recline have been reduced, besides the smaller number available."
16045,I always get the bulkhead seat on the other american airlines 737-800 (738)  thiose seats have the most legroom and nobody relines.  However on the 738max is a different story. Rhe bulkhead has a very small space. My size14 shoes do mot fit comfortably in the limited spade
16046,This is a good seat.  You do give up a moveable armrest for legroom.  But the best part is you still have underseat storage.
16047,"A little cramped for leg room, but the seat was comfortable.  Very tight with other passengers beside me, felt like we were crammed in together."
16048,"LAVs are a problem.  I thought this was an AA problem w/ 180+ seats, but I just flew Air Canada's (YUL-SFO) and they are equally as bad.  The sink is a waste of time.  Give passengers a wet wipe instead.  I will connect via another city (instead of LAX) to avoid this plane.  What a bad design."
16049,"Brand new plane. Comfortable
Seats with powerport but no individual screen"
16050,"This new version of the 737 is good for the airline but bad for premium passengers.  The first class seats have a pitch of 37, instead of 40 in ordinary 737's, there are 18 fewer MCE seats and more rows in sardine class"
16051,Very small legroom. Did not like the design of the aircraft at all. Will never travel in this flight anymore.
16052,Trash layout by AA. All economy seats should be yellow. Lavatories need to be colored red. The only thing is the temporary free WiFi. If this is the future I will not be flying AA anymore.
16053,The bulkhead in. the 738s is my favourite seat. However in the 736 Max 8 the legroom has been reduced compared tiobthe other 738s. Im sure to accommodate extra seats.
16054,"Seats on the first row of emergency exit 16 do not recline. They do not even come with a recline button (unlike row 17 which has recline button). Economy Lavatory quite tight, and sink is ridiculously small."
16055,"Extemley unconfortable hard seat, limited leg room.  Coach lavatories tiny.  The only good thing about the 737 Max is its new and the wifi is free (for now)"
16056,"Row 8 is a great row. There is no bulkhead between first class and coach, so you can put your bag under the first class seats and you have a little extra legroom. I'd recommend getting this or another MCE seat. 

I went and tried one of the standard seats towards the rear of the plane, and despite all the reports they aren't too bad. If you are a larger person though, you will likely be a bit cramped. I'm 6'0 tall and had just enough legroom. Keeping it in perspective, the seats are more comfortable than Frontier/Spirit/United, so you could be in a worse situation at 30,000 feet."
16057,I would consider the seat pitch in 12F to be fairly limited. This seat is much noisier than many as there are air ducts which run through the wall of the cabin right in front of this seat (this is why seat 11F has no window).
16058,"The seat was really narrow due to the fixed armrests. Also, the TV screen was off to the side and not directly in front of me."
16059,"There is a window, but it is in the forward half of the space, which does not allow the passenger to lean into it, thus reducing the shoulder width by several inches. I choose the window for those extra inches."
16060,"Flew this from SLC to DFW. Great view, and great engine sound during takeoff! The seat was nice, so I was able to doze off for a while."
16061,"Forewarning - this seat is exceedingly narrow. Vs. reducing width in all three seats per normal, AA kept Row 15  middle seats standard width and placed all the burden on A/C/D/F. Like me, you may be forced to lean into the aisle while the E seat guy enjoys his full seat + two armrests. Miserable!"
16062,This flight was supposed to be Layout 2 (Project Oasis) and an Exit Row. Last minute equipment change to Layout 1 resulted in downgrade from MCE (exit row) to MC with small leg room. No acknowledgement or announcement from flight crew despite confusion among nearby passengers.  Plane was late and crew hurried to depart. Helpful ticket attendant at arrival gate printed my seat details and told me to apply for refund. Also said pre-flight adjustments should have been made for MCE paying passengers. NOTE print out your seat details. Afterwards I looked on my website account and details were not available only seat# and total$$ paid.
16063,"No window, which causes shoulder space to be more narrow."
16064,"Seats are narrow but not oppressively so (I am short and plus-sized). Leg-room was great, more than enough to stretch legs out comfortably. I didn't notice anything strange with the arm-rests, aside from your tray folds out of them. Didn't notice anything strange about the framework of the plane, either. The media screen in the seatback ahead of me proved to require a bit of a stretch to reach. View out of the window was great."
16065,"Very comfortable seat and more storage than usual for domestic first class - in addition to the seatback and decent tray table, there was a side console and an extra tray on which to set drinks. Better than average IFE selection. Would definitely recommend this seat specifically and probably the aircraft overall - in all it seemed quiet, smooth, and had the illusion of space given its lighting and window setup."
16066,"Another comment asked for which rows have the windows aligned and not the frames between the windows.  For a bigger guy, this matters so you can lean right or left and have the extra few inches before the window and not the frames in between them.  Well for this aircraft you want an even numbered row for that.  Seat is identical to a Southwest seat."
16067,"Seat is comfortable, im 5'10 220+ lbs and fit nicely. Never used the power outlets since its such a short trip, the priority seating and deplaning and the free alcoholic drinks are worth the extra money."
16068,"My review is for the insufficent bathrooms in the Main Cabin -- there are only 2 serving 144 passengers, resulting in constant long lines.  It was a major inconvenience.  While there is a third bathroom up front, American's flight attendants actively restrict the use of this bathroom to the 16 first class passengers.  This should not be allowed -- using limited inflight bathrooms on a long flight is a fundamental need and should not be associated with class."
16069,This seat was narrower than the seat next to me.  I paid for seat upgrade but AA did not honor it.  They moved me to this seat so I did not get to sit next to my wife.  I am 6 feet 215 lbs.  I was not comfortable but at least I was toward the front of the plane.  I had to bend down to look out the window.  The window location did provide a bit more shoulder room.  I think AA has gone to far on reducing seat width and spacing.  I just would not recommend this plane.  I paid the same price for upgrade on an Airbus A321 and was way more comfortable and actually got the amenities paid for.
16070,The under seat storage is taken up by a power box.  Same for 29E
16071,"All seats on this 737-800 plane are very uncomfortable. The seat cushion is very thin and does not provide adequate support, specially on long flights. This plane is used for coast to coast travel, so bring your own seat cushion (BYOC)."
16072,7A is extremely narrow as because of the bulkhead as well as the window being misaligned the window support reduces your shoulder space. Extremely uncomfortable.
16073,"DO NOT! and I repeat DO NOT! book this seat. Absolutely the worse seat I have ever sat in on AA.  First of all you are going to pay extra to get a few inches for leg room.  Not true, in this seat you have a wall in from of you and no way to stretch your legs, like you could in the seats behind you. Oh, by the way, no more tv's.  Only ceiling monitors.  So, bring ear plugs or read lips.  One more thing, no snacks were given out and in this seat you can smell the food being served in business class."
16074,Listed as cautionary but is truly a BAD seat. Some idiot at Boeing or American deciced to put half an armrest attached to the seat that jabs into your back/side constantly.  It also reduces sear width since it almost 3 inches from the fuselage unlike regular seats. No need for it.  What a pain.
16075,"Mark It Red!  The armrest tray is less than 6"" wide, no tray in front, AND the seat does recline, 1/8"".  Never offered anything to eat, pay or no pay, got one lousy diet coke.  Six hours of misery.  The two lavatories had baby poop smeared everywhere while the four attendants sat in their seats for almost the entire trip.  By the way the air vents give out only a breath of air.  Misery."
16076,"Row 8 seats behind bulkhead row, thus the leg room/floor space is greatly reduced in the middle row and slightly reduced in the window row, due to placement of stored bulkhead tray tables. The tray tables are stored in a metal housing under the bulkhead row seats. The middle seat has 2 trays stored in their floor space. The window row has 1 tray stored in their floor space. The aisle seat is not affected."
16077,"I have to disagree with those who are complaining about Row 7.  This row has exceptional legroom due to the distance between the row and the barrier separating First Class from coach.  If the tray tables in the armrests make the seats any less wide than Rows 8 or 9, it is imperceptible.  I sat in 8D on the return trip and wished I was back in Row 7.  I am very disappointed that AA is planning to remove the video monitors from its planes.  I love using them and am always glad to see them when I board.  It is MUCH nicer than using a laptop."
16078,"Can't believe row 7 is being sold as premium seating. Paid $70 for seat 7A and got none of the perks touted. Boarded in group 5 and the overhead bin space was already full. Because of the bulkhead, there's no seat in front of you so you also have to find overhead bin space for your personal bag, typically in a row behind your seat (which means waiting for everyone to deplane before you can retrieve it). Can't stretch out because of the bulkhead, and the tray table is in the armrest so less width too. Just 1 chance to request the ""free drinks"" when the cart goes by. Would have been better off sitting in the back of the plane."
16079,"This should not be sold as a Main Cabin Extra seat.  The bulkhead limits legroom to less than a regular seat.  There is probably a little extra space to get in and out, but my row mates still had to get up.  The tray table was not very stable since it came from the armrest.  There is no place to stow your carry on, either.  I would not choose this seat again, and I certainly wouldn't pay extra for it."
16080,This felt like less leg room than the standard seats and with limited shortage it was not worth the upgrade fee.
16081,Even though this is the last row of first class the seat does recline. The bottom of the seat slides forward a bit and the back reclines. Comfy and good seat.
16082,"Flew to Boston direct on this airplane and the IFE is the only thing I can say worked better then expected.  It was touchscreen capable and worked pretty well.  It has a headphone jack and a USB port.  Paired with Bose noise cancelling headphones it was great.  The seat itself is nothing to write home about.  Uncomfortable (standard) and cramped but that's what you get in economy.  Not sure if main cabin extra would be worth it?  The exit rows however are not, the width of the seat is reduced significantly which does not make up for extra leg room.  Flight attendants were great and we didn't crash so I consider that a win!"
16083,"10A is simply horrible, as pointed out by the others. The out of phase window creates a convexity that cramps you horribly. I regretted switching from my regular coach seat, and it is astonishing that AA would charge $$ for this seat!"
16084,"The protruding seam for wall/window panels is exactly where my shoulders were, so it cramped comfortable space significantly."
16085,Terrible exit row seat.  Seat divider holds the tray table and does not move resucing seat width.  The side panel comes further into cabin due to emergency window severely reducing space for your right side.  You will be in an uncomfortable contorted position but with plenty of leg room.
16086,"I heard AA is removing TV screens from seatbacks, so not sure if the config was old or new - this one did had TVs.  Leg room was sufficient - much better than the window seat on the config without seatback TVs.  Still, felt a bit tight when the seat in front reclines.  Nicer tray table - folded in half, which was a big help with the reclined seat reducing space. 
 Flying ORD-LGA, the seat was sufficient and felt much better than the previous leg I flew on the a/c without seatback TVs."
16087,Tray tables in all the exit rows are in the arm reats making the seats more narrow and arm rests fixed.
16088,"Restricted underseat storage due to entertainment equipment box in F seats not just B,C,D,E as noted. 
Very cramped feeling in this plane - way more cramped than previous economy class seating on the older 737s
The passenger next to me (26E) had to use his standard size laptop on his lap because the tray table was too narrow for it which was not an issue with laptops when I have flown on older 737 planes"
16089,"The tray tables in all Exit Row seats are in the armrest, making armrests immovable and reducing seat width."
16090,"Newer plane, from 2016. This economy seat is very nice, features IFE. Lots of different bells and whistles. Inflight magazine is hidden behind tray table, which folds in half. Has AC power, and a USB and headphone jack on IFE screen. Seats are a bit too upright in non-reclined position, and the legroom is mediocre. The IFE did respond to touching well, though."
16091,Seat has been narrowed by tray in armrest. Right arm rest is shorter than the left and is uncomfortable.
16092,"Decent seat, but the window is off center. Not the worst (little bit of wall comes in handy for naps) but nkt ideal."
16093,"Assessment of a few previous posters is inaccurate.  3A/B have plenty of leg room the on 738 (NOT the 738Max).  I fly AA often out of ORD, and the leg room and recline (actually the slide) is quite sufficient.  Last ride was yesterday from ORD to MCO.  I'm 6ft2in and could not touch the bulkhead with my feet.  AA is messing all that up by reconfiguring all 738s to a much tighter seat pitch.  Okay for a couple hours, not okay for a trans-con, etc.  They are also ridding themselves of IFE.  You'll have to have PED and the AA App in order to have entertainment on board."
16094,"Seat DOES recline and was comfortable leather.  Equipment box under all the first class aisle seats partially limited width of legroom area, but was adequate after I stored my backpack up above, instead of under the seat.  They moved over the divider slightly into the window seat area, so both seats have same amount of legroom.  Good seat pitch and no problem when the person in front of me reclined.
Crew on this flight from ORD to SFO was efficient and pleasant.  Lunch was OK."
16095,"On a 737-800, there is a fixed ""stub"" armrest on the window side that significantly reduces seat width.  The armrest between 15A and 15B is a typical exit row armrest that contains the tray table, further reducing seat width.  I would rate this a yellow, not a green."
16096,"Is it me, or are the seats & space getting smaller? Terribly uncomfortable for a 4+ hour flight with a large man in 11D working on his laptop the entire time.  15"" from my nose to the seat in front when that passenger reclined. The best part about this seat was being able to get out of it faster than if we were further back on the plane."
16097,"1579 ORD->BDL. This is not a preferred seat; it's regular economy (along with the rest of row 13). IFE good video quality but the audio jack required a lot of fiddling with in order for it transmit sound, in the end I had to hold my headphone jack with my hand in order to hear the sound well. I liked the HUD map. The legroom was fine to me at 5'10"". The tray table has a full and half table configuration (it folds in half) which is nice."
16098,"The wall curves in and out to accomodate the windows.  The ""divider"" between them juts out into your shoulder in this seat.  Be great to know which seats have this issue so we can avoid them"
16099,Seat is the worst. The extra leg room doesnt cone close to making up for the 1/2 arm rest (really!). It has fixed armrest so you need to be very thin to be comfortable.
16100,i think the last 2 rows the seats pitch is less then 31 inches.. making any trip super unpleasant
16101,it was very spaces even with the bulkhead and there was an overhead movie and the sky interior over all a nice exsperince
16102,"Seat reclined just fine, was comfortable for 7 foot tall passenger"
16103,Seats are very tight together. Not a lot of room
16104,"I avoid AA as much as possible due to their seating set-up in general.  7C on the bulk head has two issues, first the dividing wall goes all the way down so there's not space in front to stretch you legs - so hopefully there's overhead bin space to put your single carry on. Second the seats have hard sides (not open) and are narrow - I'm not terribly large (about a size 14/16 ladies) and wondered if I'd fit.  Any person with sizeable hips would not be able to squish into this seat.  Avoid this is you have any bottom."
16105,"chair does not recline 
also chair in front has extra recline so it takes about half you area if someone sits in front of you. Every movement they make makes the chair shake as well as the desk"
16106,"For my experience it was true that the leg room was decent but I am short sooo... the seat is incredibly narrow and can be painful if even slightly overweight. In the amenities section of seat guru it says there is video entertainment at every seat, it was not available on any economy seat in my area."
16107,"3-22-2018 For a middle seat, I found it to be comfortable. I am 5'6""and had plenty of leg room. The seat is a reclining seat and has a fold down lap tray. A small screen tv was viewable from this seat. There is room to store a small carry on under the seat in front. No plane noise."
16108,Plenty of leg room. Seats are a bit cramp with the tray tables in armrests.
16109,"At least it's relatively new re: seatback entertainment and power ports -- a plus. HOWEVER: A continuing mystery why so much foot space is taken up with equipment boxes, and yet we are asked repeatedly to put carry-on non-rollaboards down there.  Both sides of the footspace for the middle seat in this row (didn't check others) are shrunk by such a box, leaving me with not quite enough space for my feet, never mind a briefcase.  Also, not seat-related, but we were supposed to be able to purchase breakfast and no one came around to take orders  -halfheartedly - until the very last hour of the flight.  Unsurprisingly, no one ordered anything. Air circulation isn't great either, even with the new controls -- the lady next to me almost fainted and we were so jammed in that she really couldn't even begin to get her head between her knees.  American needs to reclaim some idea of human decency toward its coach passengers."
16110,"This seat (10A) has to be the worst seat I have ever sat in, on any airline including Spirit and Frontier.  The lack of window is more than annoying, it also makes for less shoulder room so it is incredibly tight and claustrophobic."
16111,Misaligned window seat makes the arm room signifcantly less.
16112,Narrow seat with less legroom than most seats. Not a good choice
16113,"There is a decent amount of legroom in 7D  -
 I would rate the seat ""green"". This is because there  bulkhead wall doesn't extend all the way to the aisle. Therefore you can stretch your legs under about 1/2 the first class seat in front of the bulkhead wall."
16114,"I don't understand how American can call this a preferred seat. As a 'million-miler' at least I didn't have to pay for the privilege of sitting in a seat that has an obstruction of some kind under the seat in front of it that precludes extending one's legs straight ahead. Rather, I had to sit at an angle for the entire flight between Palm Beach / PBI and Chicago's ORD the other day. It was most uncomfortable; but - then, that seems to be the way American's going; the new CEO that came over from US Airways in the post merger appearing to want to down-grade American to compete with Spirit's market-demographic."
16115,"Flew AA between Chicago's ORD and Palm Beach's PBI twice in the past week; unfortunately - for me, I was booked on the sole daily non-stop between these two airports on American and on their 737-800  in 10A southbound, which is considered a 'preferred seat' at/by/ American - at least I didn't have to pay extra for it as a 'Million-Miler.' Because the seat has no window the customary 3-4 indentation for the concave window area isn't there and the interior wall extends into the row/seat by 3-4 inches. In my case that mean't that I my left shoulder was pressed up against the cabin's interior wall the entire flight and I, in turn, angled to my right the entire time I was on board. Additionally, the space between my seat and that of the seat in the row in front of me meant that when the passenger in front of me put his seat-back back I couldn't lower my tray-table to anything approaching level, even to rest a beverage upon without it sliding forward. Simply, avoid this seat!"
16116,"Short flight from PHX-SAN... thank goodness. Wedged into what has to be an even narrower seat than is typical, i had to sit at a slight angle to fit. No room to stretch legs with the bulk-head immediately forward. At 6' - 230lbs., I realize I'm a good-sized man and will always find anything except the front cabin a little tight, but this seat is sold as an upgrade. Joke's on me! Avoid this seat if you are any larger than a munchkin..."
16117,"Continue to be disgusted and frustrated with AA. SFO:ORD on old aircraft with no seatback IFE, no pre flight drink service in first, overheads with hinges that dont allow roll aboards tonfit, flight crew unhelpful and allow main cabin to put carryons in first class. Joke for fare paidv"
16118,"Not actually that much leg room compared to other airlines, I would say no more than 34"". Much better than having your knees smashed in the regular econ seats but not worth the extra $60 especially when compared to other airlines. 

Seat also has very limited back support, my back was aching after a 1.5 hour flight. I rarely get back aches..."
16119,Starting on Row 10 and going a few rows back (maybe 5) there are no windows on this side of the plane.  On the DEF side of the plane these rows all had windows.  This makes no sense to me.  Why is this?
16120,"The seat was very uncomfortable. Please note that if you have a long flight, there is no seat entertainment. It is central entertainment."
16121,Limited legroom due to bulkhead wall. 7D and 7C are the only good seats in this row. Access to window though.
16122,"This seat and all 'B' and 'E' Main Cabin Extra seats have narrow underseat storage and foot room due to 2 - 5"" (10"" total reduced space) utility boxes mounted under these seats. I will try to add a photo."
16123,Arm rests dont move and leg room is a little tight due to the bulkhead.
16124,"Great legroom in exit row 14.  However, the padding on the exit row window seat is cut-down to help egress.  Feels like sitting on a bleacher seat."
16125,"Seat 7A is encroached by the fuselage wall, especially if you are 5'10"" or over."
16126,Plenty of legroom however the seats are extremely narrow and the curvature of the plane causes your shoulder to hit the wall during the entire flight Practically no way of sitting up straight without your shoulder hitting the wall... avoid this seat
16127,Plenty of legroom But the seat is very very narrow.. I have a 36 inch waist I can barely squeeze into the seat ... the seat also is very hard and the cushion is very solid and the back has virtually no cushionmy friend is sitting in row 12 and has a much better seat ... AVOID THIS ROW ....
16128,"For a 3.5 hour trip to SJU, it was more unpleasant than pleasant.  The 35-37"" legroom estimated is more like 34"".  My knees were clear of the seat pocket, however the impressive PTV was unwatchable with 7C reclined for 95% of the flight, as the TV screen cannot be tilted the headrest was about 6"" in front of my face.  The seat itself was on the thin side but not unbearable.   Movable armrests in this row, unlike 7 which had immovable ones with the trays in the armrest."
16129,"Nothing special, decent view out window, this plane has overhead IFE."
16130,"Horribly uncomfortable seat. I'm 6'2, 175lbs, had to sit completely upright because my knees were in the back of the seat in front of me. It was like sitting on a park bench for 2 hours. I've never had such an uncomfortable flight in my life. 

The fact that they want to charge you $64 for the same seat with an extra 2"" of leg room is just insulting. This would need to be $100+ cheaper than anything else for me to fly again on a short flight. I'll stay home for anything longer."
16131,Flight AA393. Premium coach seat. Good leg room with leather seats. Comfortable but NO AC power! Flight is short but it is a nuance not having power to recharge mobile devices or computers (for a Premium seat!)
16132,"I'm 5'10"" and mostly leg, and the bulkhead really restricts legroom.  No pouch on the bulkhead, either, so anything not in your bag in the overhead has to be in your lap. The aisle in row 7 is the only place to be, because you can at least stretch out one leg, when there's no carts or passengers going by.  Not a great seat for a 4 hour flight."
16133,Avoid this plane if you can. The seats feel like you are sitting on a bench. There is no under-seat storage due to the entertainment boxes. My handbag took up all the room and I had no where to put my feet. The plane was HOT! The vents for the aisle seat are over the window seat. The air never reaches and you cant reach to adjust.
16134,"First class does not have recliner seats. If you try to recline,the seat forces you to slouch in a hard shell.  No extra room, just forced slouching. Food:awful,  Fly coach and bring a sandwich. Why are there no additional jumbo jets to Chicago? Why was I charged more for these seats? No luggage connection with BA flight. First class passengers had to claim and carry our own luggage (even checked-in baggage) over to BA in the international terminal. No help or offer of help from American ""ground support."" Great incentives to fly other airlines."
16135,"While the seat was pretty supportive and spacious, the IFE system puts two(!) boxes underneath the seat in front. There was no space at all for my bag and made me twist my feet in order to stretch out my legs. More room for feet on the aisle and window seats."
16136,"for a 6'1 250lbs guy the paid upgrade to Main Cabin Extra was well worth it. the extra leg room was enough to fully stretch my legs under the seat in front front of me. my first flight had over head screens so there was no IFE box under the seat making for the feel of even more leg room compared to the return flight that had seat back screens with the IFE box under the seat. with the IFE boxes I had more space in 8F than my girlfriend had in 8E due to the placement of her IFE box and mine. the seat itself was a different story, horribly uncomfortable for the 4 hour flight, had i not been able to stretch out my legs im sure i would have been in some pain upon landing. If i were to ever fly on an AA B738 again i would for sure pay extra to be in Main Cabin Plus."
16137,The aircraft is a 737 800. This seat as well as 14 c and their cross aisles 14d and 15 d are only 2/3 as wide as the rest of the seats in the aisle. Thus when coupled with fixed armrests with tables renders the seats fit only for children who cannot occupy exit row seats.  Terrible seats
16138,"First, American flying the 737-800 on transcontinental flights is just an insult. 6 hours on this flight in narrow seats with 31"" pitch was long, however, I do recommend this seat as on the 738v2 it is misaligned to the window and does provide extract shoulder room if you recline the seat slightly.  A small person was in the middle seat and I did not feel cramped."
16139,"This seat is absolute hell.  It's very narrow, and a structural part of the plane protrudes over the armrest and a good 2-3 inches into your seat space.  Because this is curved, the taller you are the worse it is.  I'm 6'4"" and this is the worst seat I've ever had on a plane."
16140,The seat was comfy with plenty of leg room. The overhead storage was pretty tight. With no under seat storage. The food drink and service was very good. The internet was a complete waste of money. The internet service was slow or non-existent could not even send text messages on Facebook. This was the front row of seats in first class up against the bulkhead. It seemed to me to be a bit roomier and having a seat in front of me. It was a good flight from Dallas to Chicago on 18th March 2017.
16141,"Flew MIA to St Kitts.  A extremely uncomfortable seat for first class.  It was an oversized economy seat.  Like the 
review says, there are NO INDIVIDUAL SEAT VIDEO screens.  You must bring your own device which is fine unless there is no wifi. Since our entire flight was over water there was no wifi available.  I was not aware wifi was not available over water. I had no movies downloaded on my iPad thankfully I had books."
16142,"737 DFW TO FLL. I paid extra for this seat!! Im a short guy, 5'7"", and I cant put my legs straight, nor a book beside me. American Air should be ashamed of themselves"
16143,"Fusilage wall angle reduces shoulder room by 2"" making seat uncomfortable"
16144,"Extra legroom seat and all seats are narrow. No TV on seat back but there are TVs on ceiling every 5 rows or so. Bring your own ipad. Avoid american when possible cause seats are so tight and legroom is about 1"" less than Delta. This was JFK-Phx"
16145,"Very poor seat with less legroom, due to bulkhead location, than a regular economy seat. Definitely not worth the $64.00 extra I was charged to book this seat. Sat in 11C on outbound flight for 1/2 the cost and was much more comfortable."
16146,No WINDOW!!!!  Should have looked here first.  I always choose a window seat.  My fault but was highly irritated.
16147,"3A is the bulkhead row on this version and the legroom is excellent.  I am not a fan of these seats that don't recline, they sort of rock back. I think the cushions are hard and uncomfortable for anything more than an hour, but admittedly I have little cushioning of my own.  The IFE screen is quite large and the two windows are aligned.  Good seat overall."
16148,"This was the worst airline seat and the most discomfort I have ever had on a plane. I am 5'8"" and 230 lbs, and was assigned this middle seat that has immovable arms. I didn't think I could squeeze into it, but I did--barely. I had very little arm room and sat with my arms crossed most of the time, so I wouldn't hit the people next to me..who also had little room. If my flight had not been only an hour and 10 minutes, I would have had to try and switch seats or take a different flight. All the overhead space was taken in the area, so I had to take my carry on to the middle of the plane. you aren't even allowed to put a purse under these row 7 seats because of ""FAA regulations"" according to the stewardess. It was awful and I will never fly a 737 with American again."
16149,"While the seats are older, this means that reclining slides the seat forward while reclining you back. Although it is the bulkhead, this recline feature allows you to stretch out farther without feeling discomfort."
16150,"Row 10 is to be avoided. It is the first regular coach seat behind the Main Cabin Extra seats in Row 9. They have a greater recline than Row 10, which means that there is almost no room left when they do recline.  It was literally the most squished I have ever been on a plane. I am very small, as is my daughter (5'4"" and 110 lbs) and both of us were in agony. They keep tightening seats -- at some point, mayhem will break out!"
16151,"I was actually impressed!  Despite the reviews saying how old the plane was, I loved the seats!  They were brand new but had no TVs like the other version of this plane.  The only issue I had was that the wifi was painfully slow.  Gogo seems to hate me with a burning passion every time I use it."
16152,"Save your ""Main Cabin Extra"" money for something more worthwhile.  Unless you're nice and skinny (I'm 5' 11"", 220 pounds), these seats are ridiculously narrow.  And 7A, being against the fuselage seems even more narrow.  I had no room for my left arm and my shoulder was hitting the fuselage.  Thank God my wife was sitting in the middle seat so I could use some of that space, otherwise I would've spent the flight with my arms between my legs.  Legroom is OK, but the bulkhead will keep you from stretching them if you're over about 5' 7"".  I'm just glad my flight was only about 2 hours. Any longer would've been torture."
16153,"Seat 9F is supposed to be Main Cabin Extra, but it certainly didn't feel like there was any more leg room than standard coach.  my knees were making contact with the pouch in front of me, and that shouldn't happen in Main Cabin Extra.  I feel ripped off and will complain to the airline."
16154,"All coach seats on this plane are pretty narrow, closer to 17"" as opposed to A320/321 which are closer to 18"".  Paying $80 extra for this seat was clearly not worth it.  I'm pretty big, at 6' and 260 lbs.  But this seat with the tray table in the armrest was to narrow for me and was extremely uncomfortable.  It was so uncomfortable that I originally had this seat for the return, which I changed to a non-Main Cabin Extra middle seat for the 3 hr flight from DFW-EWR."
16155,"This was the smallest seat I have ever sat in on a commercial airplane. There was in-seat entertainment but it was useless since it was about 8"" away from my face. I am 5'7"" and my knees were touching the seat back in front of me (which was fully reclined for the whole flight). Only a very small bag fit underneath the seat because of the electronics boxes. The seat pocket is now just a small mesh sleeve about the size of one iPad. The window was misaligned and very low (can't look out without bending way down, which I couldn't do because the seat in front of me was too close). I ordered a drink but had to hold it in my hand because the half-tray wouldn't even go down since it was so close to me. Terrible seat."
16156,"I am not sure why you would pay extra for this seat. There is no additional leg room or width. Also, this flight from sfo to mia os configuration 2 for the 737. This row has a middle seat. Dont pay extra, there is nothing different about this row."
16157,I have flow on two variations of the 737. One older one (without the sky interior) and the latest and greatest one. I feel that the older the aircraft is the better the legroom is since its generous on the ones without IFE. Not so much the ones with IFE since I had issues trying to get my bag fully under the seat and the legroom was rather tight even in Main Cabin Extra. The notion of newer being better is not always true in this case. I'll stick with having a flight with decent legroom.
16158,"Row 10 on this aircraft seems to be particularly tight, not just 10A. This seat has an outlet right where my left knee should be. Since I'm 6'5"", this means I have my knees in the back of the passenger in front of me, who paid $200 for her extra space seat which she now can't recline. Neither of us are happy!"
16159,"This plane did have seatback entertainment. Consequently, my carryon (which fits under the seats of the regional jets!) had to be stowed in the overhead.  Even though I have gold status, all the bins were full back to row 21!  So, plan accordingly... you will NOT be able to fit anything bigger than a small handbag under the seat in front of you, and the minions of Platinum customers will take all the overhead space!"
16160,Main Cabin Extra seat($79 each way).Leg room was fantastic.Noticed 7C and 7D had EXTRA leg room as the bulkhead is only halfway in front of them.
16161,"This plane is great, the seats are great but are not the best looking. Power between seats did not work. For IFE download the American Airlines App to watch. Radio worked fine but was a little slow."
16162,Horrible cramped seat. I am 6 feet tall and could not get knees in front of me. Next time fly Jet Blue
16163,I'm 6'4 and purchased Main Cabin Extra Seat 8C.  This seat was comfortable for me. I was able to stretch my leg under the seat in front of me.
16164,"Seat lines up with seam of bulkhead panel, not providing much elbow room."
16165,"You'd better have a small tush to squeeze into this seat. The width is unconscionably narrow in the seat with the moveable armrest, but this seat is more narrow than that. I'll surely be Sponge Bob Squarepants by the time we land. Nice legroom, of course. 14A might be a better choice."
16166,There is a break in the bulkhead that allows seats 7C and 7D to stretch legs under the last row of seats in first class.  There is also no restricted overhead storage at row 7; the overheads here span row 6 in first class and row 7
16167,"This main cabin extra product is ridiculous.  Seat pitch is nothing but economy!  Why do we have to pay extra for 1/2"" extra pitch.  I just remebered why i don't fly this airline."
16168,This seat has the wall protruding into the seat.  This limits shoulder room and is uncomfortable.
16169,"Not only does it not have a window it is actually convex- protrudes out from wall. If you are slightly claustrophobic at all don't sit here! If 9a reclines his seat, you cannot even bend over to get your bag from underneath 9a. You better know 10b real well because your going to be rubbing shoulders with them."
16170,"For a ""main cabin extra"" seat, this is not worth it.  The window seat is closer to the wall of the cabin which creates a more narrow seat area.  For the entire flight, my right shoulder was pressed against the wall and my left shoulder was pressed against the gentleman in the middle seat.  I'm 5'8"" at 200lbs and he was about the same height and about 180.  I've never had so little lateral room, on any flight."
16171,These seats do fully recline (last row of first class)
16172,"Seat is narrow as tray folds into the armrest but, as my pet peeve on airlines is legroom, 14F had ample legroom and I was even able to put my backpack under the seat in front of me (some airlines don't allow this on exit seats)."
16173,"Don't pay extra for these seats. They are marked as main cabin extra but because they are bulkhead, the seat width is not like the others. Additionally the seat built is some strange, very thick device."
16174,"Unlike some of the featured reviews ans this seat map, my seat does recline in the back of first. Comfy, plenty of room. My favorite part about any non-bulkhead in first is that most ipad covers can slide in there, you can hang it from that and watch movies while eating a meal or having drinks!"
16175,"Seat is the worse. It is a ""window"" seat without a window :/"
16176,"On the aircraft that have been outfitted with the new seats with IFE screens included, the issue is not leg room. The top of the seat where the screen is bends out toward your face... when someone reclines, it's unbearable. I dropped something on the floor and had by face pressed against the screen on the seat in front of me, and still could not reach the ground."
16177,"Flew from Seattle to Boston via Chicago, and found the seats to be perfectly comfortable. The food was good, and there were lots of services from warm nuts to a meal. There was no entertainment, which was a bit disappointing, however I brought my own."
16178,"Compared to the Delta 737 I flew on recently, this was an unpleasant experience. Seats need to be updated for sure. American's wi-fi provides no flight data aside from the time until arrival (which was not very accurate). There is no complimentary entertainment available to watch over wi-fi, American only has free movies and tv shows on seatback IFE units, which are not on this aircraft."
16179,"Maybe I'm used to the wide body jets but this was one of the most horribly uncomfortable flights I've ever experienced.  It was hot - (small air vents barely worked), awkward window (you have to tilt head down to see out), the turbine engine is on the wing right next to this window which makes the whole area (including window) emanate an incessant deep humming/buzzing sound! Especially great if you want to sleep.  The seats are rigid as iron slabs. It was cramped/barely any leg room and what's worse - these are ""preferred seat""!?  I paid $68 extra for 12A and 12B. Never again."
16180,I like the misaligned window. It's easy to lean against the wall to sleep but you can still look out
16181,"The most legroom I've ever had. I could completely stretch out and I'm 6 ft tall.
It wasn't any colder against the exit door.
Too far from the drop down video screens to really watch anything. AC power at my seat is a real plus."
16182,"This is in reference to the 737 V1 with the newer Sky interior.  Seat 10F has a window, just a little bit in front of your shoulder.  Also, I am not tall, 5'6"", but the seat sits kind of high, so you have to bend your neck down a little to see."
16183,"This is in reference to the 737 V1 without the newer Sky interior.  Seat 12F has a window, but it is at your shoulder, which is good because your shoulder can lean in a little more against the wall.  But, if you want to look out easy, it is not so great, as you have to turn your head quite a bit to see well.  Also, I am nt tall, 5'6"", but the seat sits kind of high, so you have to bend your neck down a little to see."
16184,"This is in reference to the 737 V1 without the newer Sky interior.  Seat 12A has a window, but it is at your shoulder, which is good because your shoulder can lean in a little more against the wall.  But, if you want to look out easy, it is not so great, as you have to turn your head quite a bit to see well.  Also, I am nt tall, 5'6"", but the seat sits kind of high, so you have to bend your neck down a little to see."
16185,This was the most uncomfortable seat I have ever had.  Paid extra for the leg room of exit row but seat was so narrow and upright that I arrived in Phoenix with leg and back pain.
16186,I rode on the new retrofitted plane from SMF to DFW and it was very comfortable. I'm on the shorter side so the leg room was quite nice and there were TV screens on the back of each seat with a large amount of choices for free. The leather seats were comfortable and a lot more cushiony than the older plane.
16187,"Beware 10 A is not a window seat! The wall is several inches thicker forcing an average size person to wedge their shoulders between the wall and the person sitting in the middle. Paid $16 extra to avoid a middle seat in the back, guess what AA I want a refund. This is worse than the middle seat in the last row. Avoid this seat at all cost if you are on a long flight!"
16188,"20 years ago, this would've been a standard economy seat. Worst ""first class"" seat I've ever sat in. Are the reclines, no way to sleep in this without being a contortionist. Fly something on Alaska airlines or JetBlue or Virgin America, at least they seem to care about passenger comfort."
16189,"The seat is low and hard. Since the tray is in the armrest, it is too narrow for a larger than average person."
16190,"Seat 6A, B do not recline. This is not relfected on the website for either version of this aircraft. Still pretty comfy. First class woohoo!"
16191,"Worst seat ever.  Either it's the design of the seat itself, or all the padding was worn out.  I can usaully sit anywhere without problems, but this seat was torture."
16192,Very little padding in the exit row window seat.
16193,"Seat 19A has a misaligned window, so that if you are sitting in the window seat, you have less arm space b/c the wall pushes out more between the windows.  My movement felt very restricted."
16194,The seat positioning in this 737-800 aircraft deviates from prior seating design practices which left a gap between the interior body of the plane and seats in order to allow window passengers the ability to comfortably put their shoulder over the armrest.  In this aircraft seats are pushed up against the interior of the plane body and as a result your shoulder hits the plane interior before you can comfortably center your arm over the armrest.  My guess is seats have been shifted by almost 3 inches to the exterior of the plane. I'm not sure what this changed gained but I became acutely aware of what it took away.  Due to the cylindrical shape of the plane body taller passengers will have less usable space.  As a result I think all window seats in this aircraft should be coded yellow.
16195,Comfortable first class seat. Recline is not impacted by the bulkhead behind. The seat slides foreward when reclining. Power is available in the seat front.
16196,This exit row gives excellent leg room but the problem is the seat width is significantly reduced.  I am not a big persob (womens size 8 or 10) and both sides of my hips are pushed against the immovable arm rest walls.  Also very limited underseat storage.
16197,I have been flying for 40 years and this was one of the worst seats ever.
16198,"Terrible seat. Window divider juts into arm rest. Bulkhead on 737 is not really  ""Main Cabin Extra"" with respect to legroom. Actually less legroom than traditional Main Cabin"
16199,"Staff were great, but very unimpressed with plane.  First class had no individual entertainment system. Should be standard. All pics showed it."
16200,"Flew DCA-DFW. Very good legroom, but unable to recline because of the exit behind. Seat is also very narrow."
16201,I was booked on an MD80 but the aircraft was changed to this 737. Without doubt 10A is the worst seat I have ever been in - it is horrible. Why is there no window? Why would Boeing design a window seat with no window and more to the point why would an airline buy it! It is so claustrophobic. Also I agree with a previous comment it is very narrow.
16202,"I love Boeing but the AA 737-800 is a shame.  MC Extra seats are a joke. I would hate to have to sit in Main Cabin based on this. Only a short, 3 hour, flight and I can't imagine being transcontinental on this plane.  Luckily there were some other seats that were open I moved from the center seat to another row.  We returned on an A321 and it was sooooo much better."
16203,"This seat does have good longitudinal leg room, but the curvature of the aircraft limits foot space slightly, side-to-side.  On descent, the AC unit has condensation that leaks through the emergency exit release handle cover, and drips on one's arm.  Attendants said it's endemic to the 737 line.  For a tall person (I'm 6'4"") the window is too low to enjoy, making B and C the better seats."
16204,"4.5 hr flight from ORD-LAX last night. 30 min delay on ground, and still no beverages offered in 1st class. I actually didn't get a drink until I was in my seat for 1.5 hrs. I hate to be whiny, but I didn't think 1st class passengers needed to bring their own beverages aboard. Seat was comfortable. But no leg rest, no individual TV, food offering was warm stale nuts, and a chocolate chip cookie. Seriously. Definitely avoid this version of 737 if you can, I was upgraded w miles, but had I paid big bucks for this seat I would have been bummed."
16205,"Horrible flight due to the plane being so old that it felt like it was going to fall apart on take off and landing.  We had no weather to deal with at all, but the plane honestly felt like it was being twisted like a plastic toy.  People were screaming out of terror as we landed.   Beware the claims by American of their ""new"" planes, because you'll just get stuck on these and be hating it.  The seats are fabric and have no entertainment options."
16206,"This was my first experience with American Airlines, and I was very disappointed by the experience. First, the seat belt was attached wrong so that it would tie around once. Second, the power outlet was located below the armset, which made it very hard to charge my laptop. Several times I had to crouch down and reconnect my charger.
The good thing was that they seated my family in a Preferred Seat. After the flight, I realized that my seat was reserved for AAdvantage members. However, it was my family's first flight on American Airlines. We did NOT have a AAdvantage, but American Airline automatically reserved this as our seat.

Overall, the experience was ""Poor"". Next time, I would rather use another airline."
16207,"In addition to the narrower seat due to the table being in the armrest, the seatbelt also contained an airbag which also diminished the width of the seat. AA considers this seat a premium seat because of the extra legroom at the bulkhead. I rate it the worst seat I've flown in during my 55+ years of flying!"
16208,"The power outlets are located below the seat cushions in the standard Economy seats.  In this position, they are nearly impossible to use.  You have to be a contortionist and use a flashlight to find the outlet for your seat, because there is so little space between you and the previous row to maneuver and it's dark down there.  To add insult to injury, after a managed to get plugged in, it failed to charge my iPhone."
16209,"7A,7B,7C,7D,7E, and 7F are all rated as premium seats.
There is a partition between these seats and first class which severely limits leg room. All of these seats should be rated poor to unacceptable."
16210,"I was quite surprised by how much I disliked this plane. Being a US Air vet, I do like that AA has the main cabin extra option. At first I was impressed by the TVs, but that quickly disappeared. First, the entertainment box in my underseat space took up so much room that my laptop bag couldn't fit. I felt bad taking up precious overhead space, but nothing I can do. Then I realized the stupid TV was PPV only. Shouldn't spending hundreds on a flight get you a couple free movies? Horrible layout, and a huge disappointment as a semi-premium offering."
16211,"Do not choose this seat if you want a window view. We paid extra for this row, but all I could see was the blank wall. This is not just a mis-aligned window. It is no window at all. This is the one time I did not check SeatGuru, and I regretted it."
16212,the  main cabin  extra   seat  was  very  good
16213,"If you are tall, do NOT purchase an upgrade to the bulkead (Row 7, especially seats 7A, 7B, 7E, 7F). I had a miserable experience on this plane and could not be moved because the entire flight was full. I usually am not one to complain, but I battled with American Airlines customer service for 3 days trying to get my $65 back. American states that this area is in ""Main Cabin Extra""-- which includes 'Extra Leg Room' and room to 'Stretch Out'. I was so cramped in this seat that I resorted to stretching my legs to the top of the wall in front of me (sorry to anyone trying to watch Pitch Perfect 2 on the TV next to my feet). 

After getting denied for a refund three times by customer service (claiming many ""tall individuals, parents with infants, and musicians choose this row and it is very desirable""), I resorted to Twitter. According to American, despite their advertising, these seats have more KNEE SPACE, not leg room. They still denied my refund.

16214,"we had V1 737-800, first flight row 17 D & F (aisle-window)..leg room was just a little more than seats further back, but did not have limited under seat space in either.  Second flight had row 9D & F.  These seats had a little more leg room and still had storage for a normal backpack under seat in front.  I took a shawl to put at my back for support, but used it for a little extra warmth through the flight.  Seats are not luxury, but not totally uncomfortable. we are both slender and normal weight (no one over 160).  I am petite (5ft3) and my partner is tall (6ft6)..his legs were close to seat back in front of him in row 9, but not totally uncomfortable.  he wound up using part of my underseat to stretch his legs out."
16215,Very uncomfortable experience in Cattle Class. The aisle seat back is too upright and the shape of the cushion and seatback is not comfortable. My seat on the MD-80 was significantly better.  The person in the middle seat had so little space to use his computer that he poked me in the shoulder every 10 seconds.  Inhuman conditions for more than 15 minutes.
16216,"The seats 7A, 7B, 7E, 7F on the 737-800 v1 which have row 7 as the bulkhead row should be rated as Red and categorized as a bad seat.  The Bulk head is so close to the passenger on this 737 that there is actually LESS leg room than in a standard seat.  The bulkhead prevents you from being able to extend your legs at all.  In a regular seat, at least your legs can slide underneath the chair of the seat in front of you.  The bulkhead wall completely prevents this in this plane.   I consider this restricted leg room a very significant negative especially for longer flights.  It makes the flight extremely uncomfortable.  The Exceptions are 7C and 7D which have aisle space, so these can remain yellow.  The rest of the row should be rated red"
16217,This seat should be a yellow or red.  This was the most uncomfortable 737 seat I've ever had (usually fly United).  The rib of the plane caused me to have to sit on an angle from LAX-MIA.  And I paid extra for this torture!  Extra leg room? Compared to what? These seats are very cramped.
16218,"so disgusted at the level of product offered for this long haul to Vegas from JFK. Flying first and the product is the same mediocre level as you would get on an east coast short haul. Cloth seats, no in seat entertainment system, old plane.....not pleased at all."
16219,"Very unimpressed with this Main Cabin Extra Seat. According to Seatguru now, it has about 4-6 more inches of pitch than the regular economy seat. WRONG! The pitch was way more cramped than I though it would, it probably has about 2 more inches of room than regular economy. Luckily, I was on a short flight, I don't recommend it for the long haul. Would get aisle seat if you really want room, pretty disappointed."
16220,"Seat Guru should note that window seats on this plane are 1"" narrower than middle and aisle.  I physically measured the seat back using the provided magazine, the only thing it is good for.

I also agree with other comments that these seats are extremely uncomfortable for all but the smallest passengers.  The backs are curved, offering no lumbar support, with the padding ending in a lump below the headrest.  Anyone over 5'-6"" gets this lump right across their shoulder blades.  Terrible."
16221,First class lavatory on Boeing 737 so small an average-sized person can barely stand upright or turn around.  Location to left of plane entrance a bad decision. Seat 3A not very comfortable. Meals were really bad--feed well and have a happy flyer. Experience not worth first class fare.
16222,"Every economy-class seat in this plane should be graded yellow or red.  The entertainment-equipment boxes mentioned in the notes as ""may restrict underseat storage and legroom"", in fact leave barely enough room for ONE leg, OR a small carry-on item.  For two-legged adult passengers, these seats are simply unacceptable.

I presume there was a concern that American would file a lawsuit against SeatGuru if these seats were fairly graded in the infographic, but if you want to be of service to the traveling public you do need to address this sort of thing with more than a footnote."
16223,"I could not believe that I was on a plane from Charlotte to LA that was this uncomfortable.  I normally fly Delta, where the leg room is reasonable. If these are the kind of planes that AA is using, I will not be flying with them again.  Oh, I forgot to mention there was not entertainment available.  Really? A coast to coast flight?"
16224,Poor aircraft choice by AA  for a coast to coast flight. Not at all worth the price for a first class ticket.  No real amenities as on newer aircraft. Dont bother.
16225,"This was the worst seat I have flown in for 10 years.  Rib of plane hits you in the shoulder area, seat is really narrow and short and pitch seems off.  Just  very uncomfortable on a seat for which you pay extra."
16226,"Flew on this plane from ORD to SFO (although I don't remember which version) and back. Legroom was good, but I am smaller than average (about 5'1""). The seat space underneath the seat was just enough to push in a rolling backpack. The chicken salad I had for dinner was just so-so, so I didn't order anything else. The movie on the overhead screens was ""The Theory of Everything"", which I wasn't able to hear because the volume was either too low or too high when I plugged my earbuds into the armrest port.    Even though I was right by the engine, the noise level inside the cabin was somewhat quiet. I would recommend this plane, however bring your own food and entertainment, there is no entertainment system for every seat and the food served  was either soggy or huge in portion size."
16227,"This seat is the worst I've ever flown in. To begin with, I'll never fly transcon on an AA 737 again, as American really crams in the passengers and there simply is no comfort. Seat 9F is misaligned with the windows, and you have the rib support structure protruding into the area where your right shoulder is, so you are forced to lean in to the passenger next to you. You cannot use your right armrest comfortably and you can't lean onto the window to rest your head and sleep. If this were a short flight it wouldn't be so bad, but 6 hours of this made for a miserable experience. I paid extra for this seat to get a few more inches of legroom, but the rib structure pressing against my shoulder more than negated that benefit."
16228,"Flight date: Oct 13, 2014 9:45pm The seat 5E in first class is comfortable and also is third row seating. No personal entertainment, just the old fashion drop down screen. The service from MIA to BNA was nothing special. Usually during boarding the crew ask and serve drinks while boarding, not on this flight. Crew were too busy talking among them selves and service started during flight. Also no lounge permission with first class ticket in Miami as they told me only for international flights. Really?"
16229,"American Airlines should feel ashamed flying a plane like this. For a bulkhead seat there was no added legroom, which I would have expected. However, I was able to stretch my long legs out into the First Class cabin, but that meant each time the flight attendant opened the curtain (which was quite frequently) between First and Economy I was disturbed. I could barely see the overhead inflight entertainment from my seat. By the way who still only has overhead inflight entertainment on a 5-hour flight from LAS to JFK?"
16230,"This is a standard Buss Class seat on an older plane. Has plenty of room and a few extra pop up platforms to put drinks on. The trays are very small. Overhead screen. as usual on these you miss a lot of the dark scenes in the movies. No choice of movies of course. The flight attendants were to busy catching up to offer anything when you sat down. Made a face when I asked for a glass of water, and eventually gave me room temp water. ""trying to load the flight, can't access the ice"". Also - no Lounge access (Mexico is not considered International) and this was on a paid ticket. They charged it as International!"
16231,"When I found out I would be flying on a non-Sky Interior 737, I was disappointed, but for no reason I later found out. 11A was a comfortable MCE seat with a perfect window and a great view of the overhead TV. My ideal 737 seat from now on."
16232,"The aircraft s old and worn out. Legroom is very limited, I am 5'8"" and felt quite uncomfortable"
16233,Excellent leg room and under-seat storage. Recline without affecting space of pax behind. IFE is a shared drop down...rather than personal...a bit disappointing.
16234,"I was shocked at how old this plane was and, considering the fact that I was in ""first"" class, a HUGE disappointment for a 4+ hour flight. The seats were okay but nothing special-- only a bit roomier than the extra legroom seats in economy. There's a HUGE difference between flying business class on an international flight and on this domestic aircraft. There was no choice of movie on the overhead screens, the food was the worst I've had in a long time. It was similar to the meals that used to be free in economy class--everything served at once --choice of a pasta meal or a chicken dish-- that was it! Dessert consisted of a piece of cheesecake-- no choices at all. The flight attendants were inattentive, too ""busy"" to smile and seemed annoyed at the smallest request. This really was an insult to AA's customers."
16235,"Most uncomfortable seat - people are larger, yet AA orders smaller seats.  What a difference between the USAir A321 we had down to CUN and this strangler!  Bathroom was fit for a child - Boeing, please have real people sit in your seats and bathrooms when you design them - I will check seatguru before booking a flight - new isn't always better - look at how comfortable the old SWest planes are!"
16236,Paid extra for more knee room (which was correct) but panel in front of seat extends to floor so could not extend my legs like under a seat. For me this was actually worse seat than one where I can extend my feet under the seat ahead.
16237,Exit row window seat cushions are thin and harder than center and aisle cushions.
16238,"Misaligned window means to your left side, there is a wall that juts out further towards the seat than a normal window. Reduces the amount of space significantly. Terrible seat."
16239,I'm a fairly tall (5'10) and large (380lbs) woman. This seat was as comfortable as it could be. The armrest were moveable. I did require an extender.
16240,Further proof American Airlines is to be avoided. An AA flight attendant commuting onthe flight bouncing around in the seat infront of me asks if we going to have a problem while i get my knees jammed by the traytable. Im 6’4.
16241,"Took the 5 hour flight from MIA to PHX. Seats were what you would expect for economy; the chance to become intimate with the seat back in front of you, less seat width than a third grade school desk, and no space under the seat.  but, there was an additional ""perk"" that was surprising.  It seems the aircraft seat map is incorrect for the 737-800 version 2.  There are actually only TWO, not four, lavatories at the back of the plane for the 150+ travelers!  Luckily, they only served drinks twice or things could have gotten ugly.  Bottom line... avoid this aircraft."
16242,"I flew a short hop from GCM-MIA in MCE and then had the same aircraft in Economy for MIA-SDQ. I was impressed with the new interior: no issues with people fighting for overhead storage and sufficient room for my legs even in ""roach"". The interior was bright and clean, service cheerful on both legs. I might complain that the seat was a little hard but truthfully had no ill effects for the 2 hour flight. I am pleasantly surprised by the new interior."
16243,This is new Oasis class.  Entire Row 1 is HORRIBLE.  There is more leg space in a regular economy seat than Row 1.  This should not be sold as a FC seat ever!!!!
16244,"Brand new plane, lovely. No window at 12A"
16245,Beware! This flight was supposed to be Layout 1 and an Exit Row. Last minute equipment change to Layout 2 (dreaded Project Oasis) resulted in downgrade from MCE (exit row) to MC with no recline.
16246,Exit row worh tons of legroom. Cramped shoulders though. Seat seems slighrly woder than Delta confogiration.
16247,"On a newer plane. While extra room because exit row, the window is offset. The room os significantly reduced. Would avoid this seat."
16248,"This is the dreaded Oasis config.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  They've shoved an additional 12 seats into this aircraft at the expense of personal space and passenger comfort.  The lavs are too small to turn around in, the seats are thin and hard and your butt WILL be asleep on flights longer than about an hour.  First class under seat storage is non-existent.  You will NOT be able to fit anything beyond a very small purse under the seat in front of you.  If it's an AA 737-800 and the first row number number start at 1 rather than at 3, this is an Oasis config.  Run away.  Quickly."
16249,Plane had the new interior. Large overhead bins were nice. My seat was in an exit row so leg room was adequate. Armrests are very narrow but allow for a wider seat. Good tradeoff in my opinion. Bathrooms very small and both had lots of liquid on the floor. Not pleasant. Also seems like this plane could use another restroom. There was a line for the restrooms the entire flight.
16250,"Last Row of First Class in front of a non-existent Bulkhead was miserable.  Much less knee room than other first class rows.  Coach Bulkhead row right behind you risks children or sympathy animals being right behind your open seating.  Seats are definitely less comfortable, thinner padding, etc.  I pay for first class and these seats were not worth the price.  Do not select Row 4 on this aircraft."
16251,"Fortunately, I got an upgrade to 1st class.  Unfortunately I got an upgrade to 1st class.  These seats were not at all comfortable.  The bulkhead took away a lot of leg room and, of course, there was absolutely no storage.  I-Pads barely fit into the magazine holders.  Seats had almost no recline and no lumbar support at all.  Only actual benefit was that I wasn't stuck in a middle seat.  The WIFI entertainment system didn't work making the 5 hour trip from MIA to PHX even longer.  That system  seems like a way to lower costs by placing the burden on the traveler to try to connect using their own equipment.  Bottom line - avoid bulkhead seats"
16252,"New seats in this plane 737-800, same seats as in new 737 MAX, in first class are EXTREMELY HARD even though they are wider. MUCH Less of a recline  for 1st class seat EXTREMELY unconfortable especially for a long flight. Rest room TINY!!!"
16253,This seat is NOT for anyone broad shouldered. It is jammed against the fuselage forcing me to sit crooked and forces me to lean into the center seat about 6”. Go for the aisle!
16254,"Leg room is tight, but overall I think it's more comfortable than the old 737-800 configuration. Window and aisle seats no longer have IFE electrical boxes underneath the seats, although a small one remains under middle seats. The lavs are as bad as you've heard about."
16255,"No window or cutout, little shoulder room due to missing cutout."
16256,This far back in the plane the window seats seem to have less leg room. It looks like the seats are angled slightly to match the curvature of the plane. In this seat the window frame matches up directly with your should. If you have broad shoulders this pushes you into the middle seat. Avoid windows in the rear on this plane.
16257,Worst 1st class seat. Ever.  The B757 is a very OLD a/. Recliner” is no more than most coach seats.  No personal TV...just a 14 inch wall mount mostly blocked by tall passenger in front.  Sound system unintelligible and cabin noise level was too loud even for my noise-cancelling headset and iphone!
16258,"For those with broad shoulders...16A and 16F are not ""window"" seats, per se.  They are, in fact ""bulkhead"" seats, in that they have NO window.  I am generally not a window seat taker, but there wasn't much left on a full flight from DCA to PHX on Memorial Day Weekend, so I had grabbed what I thought was a decent MCE window seat.  When I boarded, I was more than unpleasantly surprised.  So was my row-mate, who had to deal with the issue as well, since my right shoulder now infringed substantially on his seat as well.  One of the most uncomfortable 4.5 hour flights I've had the displeasure to take.  Shame on AA for failing to make clear this rather significant shortcoming."
16259,"I paid extra for this seat!  Never again. The exit door in front of you gives you less space, not more.  There is no place to put anything in front of you and there is no overhead space as there is video equipment there.  There is no tray table at all.  The person in the seat next to me commented that I had the smallest seat on the plane to which I had to agree.  Should never have to pay extra for less!"
16260,"Good seat. Older plane, but seat was comfortable for coach. 12E is next to a large exit door with a tiny window at the top (no real window). Exit door comes out to about 6 inches next to this seat. Over 3 feet of legroom (it's HUGE). Seat DID recline slightly and the right armrest is normal, so unlike 12D, this seat only has the width slightly narrowed by one fixed armrest. You CAN use the under seat storage under the row in front of you. The 3+ feet between you and the seat in front makes a long flight less claustrophobic."
16261,"We flew this plane from Kona to Phoenix expecting lie flat seats as advertised. Our 757 - 200 plane was the domestic version with recliner seats if you can call them recliners. Barely reclined, not even close enough to sleep comfortably. As this was an overnight flight leaving at 11:34 pm really expected to sleep. Not very happy with American after spending the money to fly First/Business. They need to have better explanation of planes used."
16262,"Flew overnight from KOA to PHX. Expected lie-flat or near lie-flat seats for first class, as well as individual screens after a wonderful flight out in first on a 777. GOT NEITHER. Seats reclined only about 10 or 15 degrees, very uncomfortable for trying to sleep. One tiny screen for each side in first and volume was either too high or too low (couldn't sleep so why not watch TV). Perfectly adequate for 3 hours or less, terrible for overnight / 5+ hours."
16263,No power. No internet. A dinosaur of an airplane. Seats & crew are nice though
16264,"I was actually pleasantly surprised by the overall comfort of this aisle seat on my long PHX-OGG flight. I'm 6'3"" and 225 pounds and I thought there was adeuate legroom and personal space even in a regular coach seat. And more importantly, there was GREAT cushioning in both the seat bottom and back. And that is no guarantee anymore (My back was numb on a later UAL flight). I had an empty seat next to which helped but I was very happy that AA has not destroyed the comfort of this plane in the name of saving a few pounds."
16265,"Flew from DFW to CLT, a short hop for this International variant. Leg room was great, much better than the 737 or A321. Seat felt wider too, with more cushion. Cabin is a bit dated, and really should be updated to match the competition with in headrest screens. Plug worked great to charge up the phone, music through the armrest was a very odd selection and repeated every hour. WiFi did not work. 757 is a great aircraft, just wish American would update it but keep the seat pitch and width. It's a narrow body with a wide body feel. I would fly it over the 737."
16266,"Seats 1A, 1B, 1E, and 1F are bulkhead seats, however they are superior to the other business class seats because the footwell is much larger.  There is also more storage below the footwell, so the typical issue with bulkheads (no underseat storage) does not apply.  Row 1 seats are the best in business."
16267,Leg room is nice but the aircraft lining encroaches on your shoulder space. Good for people without broad shoulders
16268,3 hour flight from DFW to PHL. Seat was easily adjusted to be lay flat and I was able to doze off easily. 2 available AC power connectors per seat: one in front where tablet holder is and one immediately behind your head. WIFI system did not work for the flight - could not even watch entertainment.
16269,"The seat recline of row 16 (16A to F) is not only restricted, it is nonexistent, these seats don't recline!"
16270,Not having the personal Entertainment system in First Class is a drag. On board Wifi never works. So don't forget to download movies you want to watch ahead of time in any class. Terrible decision by AA to get rid of their Entertainment system and only rely on overhead TVs.
16271,"I thought this was a very comfortable seat between Dublin and JFK.  It reclined to a full bed, although I agree if you are on the inside you will have to step over the person on the outside if they are fully reclined to get out of your seat.  My wife and I were traveling together so this was not a problem."
16272,good seat- flew JFK/DUB/JFK( but 757 should be used on short haul flights/-AA uses also 757 on the CDG run).Good leg room-close to toilet-
16273,Horrible flight ever. Old plane with TV screens hanging from the ceiling so no personal entertainment. Row 14 has NO BINS to use because they decided to store equipment there. Supposed to be MCE but I couldn't tell the difference from regular economy. Row 14 is also one row back from the exit row so the config is different.  I would avoid this plane if you can.
16274,"I paid to have this seat and moved. This seat is almost 3"" narrower than 18E and 18F in the same row, not sure why. Fortunately, seat 19D remained open and I was able to move back a row. The guy in 18F moved over when I left and said, ""This is a tiny seat!"" and moved back to his window seat. My husband who was in 18C was stuck with his."
16275,"Was surprised at the pitch of the seat, About the same as United premium economy.Plenty of legroom. I did have a window and could keep an eye on the engine. Food was OK. Got a pillow and blanket and got to sleep a few hours."
16276,"Wasnt looking forward to this flight as it was on an older, single aisle aircraft with overhead screens rather than in-seat entertainment, so booked Main Cabin Extra. Well worth it, the plane looked recently refurbished, the seat pitch was great (Im 61) and the cabin was quiet. I didnt choose Exit row (10) as I though passengers might congregate at the toilet are but as the flight was quite this didnt seem to be an issue"
16277,"I flew DFW-LIM and was assigned this seat. Below it were the lifeboats, the only place to move my feet and legs was towards the front. It had limited recline despite the fact that it was not the last row. Please, be careful when you are assigned to this seat."
16278,"I flew on this 757 LIM-DFW October 2017
The seat's storage was not great. On the positive side, The bed setting was comfortable enough for me to get a few hours sleep with three couples with babies in business class. Overall the service and seat was average."
16279,"Flew in 2D from AMS to Philly.  Seat very comfy (lie flat), table movie system worked great and charged just fine after I fiddled with the adapter to ensure completely plugged in.  Tablet of course then worked for entire flight.  The tablets are gathered about 30 min prior to landing so I couldn't finish my movie - a very minor part.  Food and flight attendants simply great!  The main bother is the person in the window seat has no aisle access.  This means when they need to get up, the aisle seat must be either uprighted or stepped over. What a nuisance for both patrons on an 8+ hour flight.  Seat is narrow and space not excessively long so that could be a problem for some people if they are above average height or width.  Not too much storage but I was glad to have access to universal adapter and USB slot.  Overall I would fly this plane again but I will say I don't fee it is a good value at 135,000 miles for BC."
16280,"Business class in this plane is AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL! Old plane, old system, no built in TV! They give you these ridiculous Samsum tablets that don't seem to hold the charge- even when they are plugged in using that huge charger- and they end up dying before you finish watchingyour movie. Movies loaded im the tablets are old, I had seen all of them. 
BE CAREFUL WITH LOSE ITEMS: my cell phone was in my purse inside a side pocket that closes with a magnet. Eveything flyes off the compartment area during take off and my cell ended up underneath the seat. They called these seats the black holes because you can't retrieve anything that dissapears there. We had to wait for maintenance to come and find it after we landed. They are aware of this but they forget to mention it before taking off. Horrible, horrible flight!"
16281,MCE SEATS ARE AWFUL!  BUSINESS SEATS ARE AWFUL!  Old nasty aircraft with CRT monitors- give me a break!
16282,"The seatguru info says that these business seats are angle flat seats. However, they are in fact fully flat. i just flew this from la paz to miami the other day. AVOD for this plane, however, is absolutely primitive.  they hand out tablets for you to watch movies, and it didnt work half the time."
16283,"The recliner was broken, my husband had to sit upright from Paris to JFK. His sound on the entertainment system also did not work. Food was terrible. Do not order the steak, couldn't cut it with a chain saw."
16284,Awful seat. Tight fit. good leg room but tiny tray table which was hard to get in/out of the side. Did not recline.
16285,"American is changing the business class seats. The new seats have no entertaiment system, they have a space for a tablet (provided in most flighs, had one of six hours that they had forgotten them) and also the bose noise cancelling headphones. New seats are full flat and are face slightly tothe side with a small otoman in front. New seat control has less options but works well enough. So far the seats seem to bemore confortable than the old ones and the tablets havebetter definition. I added pictures FYI."
16286,Constant jostling by staff a nd passengers. Had to stand waiting for boarding to complete. One third of the seat corresponding to the portal for jet way. This is one of the worst layouts for an international flight across the pond. Overcharged prices with a cattle car of a configuration. Aboid this plane and american airlines if you can. Btw. No screens on headrests. I guess they assume everyone has an ipad.
16287,"Seat is lie-flat  It's pretty narrow.  I'm surprised AA has a 2-2 config on a narrow body, long haul aircraft.  Surprised AA uses the 757 on a 7 hour flight as well; seems a 767 would be a better fit on this leg.  Seat is a bit stiff yet comfortable. The narrow seat and limited space detracts from overall comfort.  This is not a complaint but rather FYI for those who are interested."
16288,american has  upgraded the seats. The business class seats are very similar to the 321 Transcontinental BC.  Much better than the oldnones
16289,"It should be ranked as red. The seat does not recline. I moved to that seat because a couple ask me to seat together (I was in the middle seat). It is impossible to sleep in a 90° angle seat. It has extra legroom, yes, but definitely choose a standard seat rather than this one. It is also very cold and the table is very unstable. If you are thinking about flying in this plane to Madrid, it will be better to take the Iberia flight."
16290,"Maui to Phoenix, overnight. THE most uncomfortable, flat recliner ever flown (4 flights/week for 20 years). Was in the upright position to start, knew something was off, not comfortable in any position. Head rest was weird, controls were jerky, like ready to fail. In FULL recline, the legs don't come up enuff so your entire body basically is on an angle, feel like sliding off under seat ahead. Also very narrow...although pleasantly surprised initially to see these seats when we arrived in first, neither my wife (5-5) nor I (6-1) were comfortable at all for the 5.5 hour flight. Would have been MORE comfortable with a nice, wide, traditional first class seat.

The old saying is true: looked good on paper."
16291,"I was on this plane for a 5hr flight from SXM to JFK, and I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, its not new or especially large, but the flight was quiet and comfortable (I think the older seats are larger and nicer than newer ones) and the plane was clean. The crew were nice and polite and the flight was smooth, even though there was rain and fog at JFK. As for people saying that it is unsafe for a 10+ year-old plane to be flying across the Atlantic, planes built after around 1975 are exactly as safe as newer ones."
16292,"Pleasantly surprised by the AA 757 (DUB-PHL): Very comfy leather-y coach seats in a 3-3 configuration, with excellent leg room -- plenty of space between my knees and seat in front of me, and room to stretch out under the seat, even with my tote bag under there. (I'm about 5'8"", most of it legs, so this was REALLY appreciated! :-D) 

Only two negatives: This is a window seat, and at times the wall of the plane was REALLY cold, but just tossing my coat over my legs helped a lot. Also, I really missed having my own entertainment unit -- on this plane, the screens were placed in the aisle ceiling, so you were pretty much stuck watching whatever was being shown, and it was sometimes awkward having to peer up and sideways at it."
16293,"Just endured an 8hr flight Manchester to Chicago with American Airlines, horrified to get on board and find no seat back TV. I asked one of the stewardess if this type of aircraft was a regular on this route to which they replied ""yes"" and apologised saying it was ""crap"". On the plus side, plenty of leg room in Main Cabin Extra, although the overhead screen view from some window seats in obscurred by the overhead locker so choose an aisle seat"
16294,"I flew from Boston to Paris with this plane, the plane was old and crowded. The plane is not equipped with screens or WIFI (when flying international), so expect long haul flights to be very boring! I recommend that you should avoid being on this horrible plane!"
16295,"The tray tables for these seats (10B, 10C, 10D, 10E) DO come down from the seat in front, they are not in the armrests. Only A & F tray tables are in the arm rests. Also the armrest between A-B and E-F does NOT flip up should either seat be empty. Also, strangely, there is a charger between A-B and E-F! This plane is a true antique (and not in a good way) it should be taken out of service."
16296,"This plane is not suitable for overnight flight. Seat is out dated, and does not lie flat, not even on an angle. It is a narrow body 757 with seats for domestic travel only- it is like taking a trip in time warp back to 1980's. Not competitive with other foreign carrier's."
16297,Great plane compared to the new cramped equipment. I regularly fly this plane to the UK in the winter. I disagree with comments. Row 9 B and C have a lot of legroom and are comfortable as there is no middle seat. You need to board first and stow your carry on and then stand as people board. Once in the air it an excellent sleeping seat as are 9D and 9E. Plus side is 9B and 9C have the lav in front so people stand in front of 9D and 9E. Put your backpack on the floor as a foot stool and sleeping is great. Down side is the 757 has about 4000 mile range so in winter with winds over the Atlantic  you run a good chance of stopping for fuel in Montreal or Boston.
16298,This seat is a great seat with the normal amount of legroom. This seat has two windows. There is no difference in this seat from any other regular seat on this plane.
16299,"First off this plane was OLD and in no way should be used for a transatlantic flight (JFK-EDI). The power point between seats didn't work, the seat couldn't recline because the button had fallen off and the one movie that was shown on the communal screen was ancient. I'd specifically booked BA via LHR to EDI but got rebooked due to an earlier cancellation. I appreciate that the flagship routes go to London on newer craft but this was a huge disappointment."
16300,"I flew this from Miami to Brasilia in April 2016 and the front cabin is really showing its age. The seats are very tired and the angle-flat sleeping position is seriously inferior to fully flat 180 degree beds in a truly modern biz class cabin. The flight staff were professional but the food was also very sub-standard. For an airline whose newly refurbished front cabins are getting good reviews, it was a very discouraging experience and AA's continuing use of this dated part of its fleet on long-haul international flights is frankly a reputational risk."
16301,"This was one of the most comfortable business class seats I've had.    I've flown extensively in both business and first class for 30 years and was completely satisfied with this product.   Usually angle flat seats are dreadful, but this one gave support to your butt so you didn't feel like you were sliding off.   The seat width and the cushion comfort were both fine.    The AVOD needed an update, but the seat was great on a short 4 hour flight."
16302,"Opinion seems to be sharply divided as to the comfort of the business class seat on this 757. For me (6'1"", 175 lbs.), the seat was the most comfortable of any I've ever had on any airline, in business or first. It's the only seat I've had whose front edge can be positioned high enough off the floor for full support under my bent knees while sitting upright, and it has a very full range of other position options. The seat was wider than the newer business class seats on AA's 321 and 777, and its padding was much better: not too soft and not too firm. Seat ahead reclines into its own shell, leaving adequate room for me to stand up in front of my window seat and step over the sleeping passenger in the aisle seat without disturbing him. Other than an inadequate stocking of wines (only a single variety was available; probably a one-time glitch), food and service on this flight were excellent."
16303,"Seat would have been acceptable for a short haul flight, but after 8 hours, and trying to sleep, it was rather crampt in the width. Miles of leg room, though! 

Not too sure why people are not a fan of these 757s, providing you come prepared for the lack of on board entertainment, I have found these planes to be relatively comfortable for long haul flights and would not hesitate to fly them again!"
16304,Just flown this plane on AA54 to MAN. Row 16 is main cabin extra but the seats are standard type without in seat power.
16305,"BSB-MIA red eye flight in row 26. Wife was in D and I was in F, nobody took the middle. I had to remove everything from the seat pocket in order to fit my legs in (I'm 6'2). Seats are basically what you would see in a domestic 737 in the late 90's. 

If you are over 5'8, I strongly recommend purchasing the Main Cabin Extra since the seats are not comfortable. We strategically purchased aisle/window at the rear of the aircraft on a redeye hoping (successfully) that nobody would choose middle. 

AA needs to retire or refurbish these old 757's."
16306,"It's hard to believe AA is still flying these aircraft trans-atlantic. The business class product is dismal. The seat's uncomfortable, inaccessible and the entertainment options and food very poor. American's 777 service from JFK-MAD is much better but I don't think I'd risk getting this aircraft again."
16307,"Terrible. From BSB to MIA. 7 1/2 hours without an entertainment screen; terrible food; tiny uncorfotable seats.
NEVER AGAIN, AA!!!"
16308,"We flew this plane JFK-CDG in Oct, 2015 and were expecting the worst based on some of the prior comments. But the seats had plenty of space and were quite comfortable in full recline (and I am 6'7"" and weigh 220lbs); indeed the seats were more comfortable than many lie-flat seats on other planes. But admittedly it is not so easy for the window-seat passenger to get by the isle seat when it is reclined. The food was surprisingly good (but not exceptional) and the service was very good. The video systems were fine. I'd fly it again if the price were right."
16309,"I flew on this ancient plane from BHX to JFK. Very cramped seats, no in-flight entertainment other than one film on overhead screens and appalling food. Will not use this airline again."
16310,"We flew this plane on July 15, 2015 from Bos to CDG.  The seats themselves are so-so but they are very close to the seats in front so that if the person in front is reclining and you want to get out, it is almost impossible without the person in front moving their seat to the take-off position. Also, there is not enough room between one's seat and the seat in front to lie flat as there is not enough room for one's legs. (I am 5'4"") This is very unacceptable for such a long flight and for business class.  I will not fly in this plane again for an international or long flight."
16311,"I flew Paris to Boston on 7 July in business class, seat 4F.  There was ample leg room (I'm a big guy: 6'2"" and 200 pounds), many positions in which to alter your seat, but the IFE was rather lacking, and the seat/screen was all quite old in appearance.  I couldn't quite get myself comfortable enough to get any amount of decent sleep, and these business class seats are not at an angle, rather they are facing front, parallel to the wall of the plane.  The seat goes almost flat, but there was still enough of an angle in the fully reclined position to be uncomfortable for me. Flight attendants and meal services were  perfectly acceptable, although as we were the last row being served our meal, they were out of my first choice entrée.  When my seat mate was fully reclined, it made it very difficult to get up and climb over her without disturbing her when going to the lavatory or simply to stretch out.  For short-haul flights, the 757-200 would be fine, but for an 8+ hour TATL flight, a wide-body jet would be much more appreciated, simply for the sake of a bigger cabin, making it feel less cramped."
16312,"I flew on this plane a few weeks back, I have to admit I was expecting the worse, I had read reviews and also flown on AA's 767 on the way in a fully flat seat. I was surprised by the flexibility this seat offered, basically there was so much control that i was able to find a confortable setting every time i tried. It's not a lay flat seat but I was able to sleep when set to sleep mode. I know you can't compare it to some of the latest trendy options, but it is much better and more flexible than I expected."
16313,Traveled on this type of plane with US airways four years a go was old then but is even worse now the plane used from JFK to EDIN was not the upgraded one as they lead you to believe Will not fly on this plane again not fit for the job seats are absolutely terrible
16314,"Ample leg room and the seat, while narrow, both reclined and the bottom shifted slightly forward, surprisingly comfortable.  Flew this MIA-BSB overnight each way, which is the only way they get away with having no seatback video and limited entertainment.  AC power outlet didn't work either way.  Old plane, time to retire."
16315,"This is the worst flight on the JFK-MAD route for AA/IB/BA. Business class seats are old and uncomfortable, movie selection is very limited, etc.
AA shouldn't use a narrow body plane such as this for such a long route."
16316,"Flew to Madrid in Coach.  Very uncomfortable, old plane.  Overhead screens, reading lights didn't work and flight attendants were unfriendly and annoyed that they had to do their job.  This plane SHOULD NOT be used for trans-Atlantic flights -- it's cramped and old."
16317,AA should not be using 757 on long haul. Business Class is very tight and narrow. Service on AF business class much better. I don't know why AA is still using this aircraft.I would not fly on this flight again.
16318,"I flew this plane on Feb 9 2015. The seats have been recently changed and they recline completely making it nice to sleep. Since the flight from Lima to DFW leaves at 3 AM!! it was nice to be able to sleep a little. The rest of this airplane is old and it is the longest route for this this kind of narrow body plane. All other airlines have the wide body planes with individual seat entertainement. This flight even though Business class had the individual screens the selection of movies was very limited, no new releases and you can't use the screen until the plane takes off so if you have a delay at the gate you can't use the screen at all and the movie I was watching cut off when we started descending so I didn;t get to see the end. United has screens that operate from the moment you seat on the plane to the time you arrive at the gate. The bathroom in business class didn't work so we had to use the economy bathroom. American needs to offer a better plane for this route. There are better choices out there. Don't fly on this plane."
16319,"We travelled in this configuration last Christmas (2013) from Miami to San Juan, PR. Seats were very comfortable for the short 2h30 flight, much better than the new domestic 24 seat B757-200. Service was far less attentive than the 24 seat cabin however, and although this was a noon flight over lunch, no cookies or dessert were offered. Individual IFE was great, and sorely missing on the other versions of this plane."
16320,I've been happily and regularly flying American Airlines for over 20 years.  However this is the absolute worse plane configuration for international travel. For American Airlines to think it's normal to fly a narrow body plane with one aisle and expect people to be comfortable on an 8 hour flight is absurd
16321,The business class seats are incredibly uncomfortable.  Very hard and I always felt like I was falling off the seat.
16322,"18f had ample leg room and was not narrower that I could notice. But i did find that there was a significant draft from the exit that was very cold. Additionally, the seats by the exit windows only reclined an inch or so. The lack of recline made the seat much less comfortable."
16323,"While this would normally be a bulkhead seat there is no wall with ample leg room however, because of the angle of the aisle, there is no under seat storage in front of you."
16324,"Seat was very comfortable.  I am 6'1"", 230 lbs.  Extensive leg room.  Seat width excellent.  Nearness to lav and galley was a non issue.  Not much service going on and the FA's didn't chat up front.  Made for a very enjoyable three hour flight on an RJ"
16325,"I hear a lot of hate for seats by the back of the plane but honestly, this wasn't bad at all. I found the seat comfortable -- moreso than the Preferred and MCE seats that I had on other flights. My partner didn't agree so YMMV. Legroom is okay (I am 5' 6"" and my partner is 5'10""). View out the window is great. FAs sat in the row behind us and I could eavesdrop on their conversations (nothing bad, just interesting!) FAs on this trip were also the nicest."
16326,"Sat in 9D on a flight to Philly June 7, 2019. The seat is not bad. The legroom is sufficient for a 5' 10"" fat guy with bad knees. My only complaint is that since it is a regional air flight there is no WiFi until the requisite cruising altitude."
16327,Window is aligned to your shoulder. You can see out fine just have to turn your head.
16328,"Any MCE seat on this aircraft is a great choice, but 8A, 8D, and 8F are especially good as there isn't a hard bulkhead limiting legroom. There is simply a half curtain blocking first class so you can push a bag under the seat in front of you and have effectively unlimited leg room too. 8C is not good though as it is in the aisle during boarding and doesn't have any floor storage."
16329,im 6'2 and my legs were really cramped up to the seat in front of me and im also a big guy too and it was uncomfrontable.
16330,"A decent, comfy seat for a 1:15 hour flight from PHL to PIT. Service was very good. Lavatory were clean. A good seat for short distances. Would not want to fly this for more than a 2 hour flight though."
16331,Main cabin extra has wide seats with full size tray table
16332,Paltry leg room for a First Class seat.  Shame on airlines for taking away inch after inch of leg space even in First Class.  No movie screens for a 3.5 hour long flight.  Avoid this aircraft. Unless you are 5 2 or smaller
16333,"First time flying this route via American Eagle. Seats were tight but not Spirit-level unbearable for the hour long flight. Biggest issue is the tray table. It is huge. Comes down right at the level of your stomach and juts into your belly a little if you're slouching forward. I can't imagine bigger people find this very comfortable. Overhead storage is quite tight, if your flight is full and everyone has roller-bags, you'll likely be checking at the gate. Otherwise, a fine plane for a quick flight."
16334,"This is the best seat in the plane. I could see First Class seats from mine and I am sure I had more leg room. I'm 5'10"" and this is the first time I could stretch my legs out and not be hitting/touching the seat or anything in front of me."
16335,"Be aware, overhead storage is limited for the single seat configuration in First Class. It is half as deep as overheads on the rest of the plane. Its max capacity is a large purse or a student backpack turned sideways. The average carry-on bag will NOT fit, and the overheads on the two-seat side of the aisle are not big enough to compensate."
16336,"I am a size 26, 5'10"" woman, and seat 15A was one of the most miserable in-flight experiences I have ever had. My knees were crunched into the seat back so tightly that I actually scraped off skin trying to straighten them out. The average sized woman next to me wasn't in much better shape. I could not put down the tray table. The armrest against the fuselage was open enough that I could scoot left and avoid encroaching on her seat, but the knee pain forced me to change positions so much that it hardly mattered. The seat is the same as in main cabin extra, so the lumbar support should be good, but the loss of 4"" of legroom completely negated that benefit.

This is a great little regional jet in most respects. Actually has good overhead storage, premium seats offer benefits worthy of the premium fee, but AVOID the main cabin unless you are petite, short, or pre-pubescent."
16337,"I am a size 26, 5'10"" woman, and this Main Cabin Extra seat was more comfortable than first class seats in most regional jets. More than enough leg room, was able to put down the tray table fully, and almost didn't need a belt extender (missed it by an inch!). The arm rest against the fuselage was positioned in such a way that I could scoot under it a bit without discomfort, meaning I did not encroach upon the seat of my neighbor. Window properly aligned. Good lumbar support, too. This jet will definitely be my top choice for future business flights.

BE CAREFUL that you don't get a main cabin seat, though. Accidentally booked one of those for my return flight and truly suffered the whole trip."
16338,"Standard cheap seat with very little leg room.

Fortunately, the flight from SGF to DFW was short.  My knees didn't fit in front of me."
16339,"Often regional jets are cramped and uncomfortable but this plane is just great,  it feels more like a larger jet like a 737.

This seat had a lot of legroom although the aisle makes an awkward turn here which could mean you get bumped by other passengers"
16340,MAX Legroom in this main cabin extra seat just behind 1st class.  There is no wall dividing 1st class and this row so plenty of leg room.  Seat tray pops out of arm rest.
16341,"This is thebest seat on the plane 42 inches of leg room stowage above and under seat in front.
Very quiet comfortable plane 2-2 configuration. 
No food or entertainment system but complimentary drink served."
16342,"I flew from Baltimore to Chicago on an American Eagle ERJ-175. I had never heard of this plane before. But I really liked this little plane. the 2+2 seating was good. plenty of leg room, had no trouble falling asleep in the seat. I would take one of these over a 737 any day."
16343,"A very comfortable seat.  More than enough legroom (I'm 5'4"" and had 5"" between my knees and the back of the seat ahead of me), and plenty of space width wide."
16344,"I had the opportunity to fly recently on an Alaska Airlines flight from Minneapolis (MSP) to San Diego (SAN) and back the following week. I had the good fortune to upgrade from Premium Economy (not bad) to First Class (wonderful). Single-wide seats are a brilliant blessing in today's ""cram 'em in like sardines"" airline economy. Sure, I miss having power outlets (not even USB), headphone jacks, and no LCD television console, but the joy-- THE JOY!-- of being able to sit normally in a seat without my knees being crushed or my sides smashed (I'm 6 feet tall and about 270 pounds-- I'm no svelte jetsetter) was so wonderful. Haven't been this comfortable since the Boeing 727."
16345,"14C is a Standard Economy seat.  Ample leg room.  I am 6'4"" 265 lbs and had enough room for my feet with my backpack under the seat in front of me.

My knees were in the way a little while the tray tables were down."
16346,"Very cold seat, there is a constant flow of cold air, Flight attendants were not able to help."
16347,Amazing leg room. It doesn't make sense how much you get. I was loving every second of it.
16348,This plane is very comfortable & staff was the best I have experienced in a long time! (Ernest & Heather) I will fly ERJ-175 anytime I get the chance! This seat was great. Lots of leg room! Totally worth the price! Do not be afraid to book this seat!
16349,"I like this seat because as mentioned you have almost an unlimited amount of leg room because the seat is positioned essentially in the middle of the ""first class"" isle. In regards to personal item space, this seat is limited because you have to share the space under the seat in front of you with the person in seat 8A or 8D. I only take a small laptop bag and there is always more than enough room."
16350,"Not a traditional bulkhead in that there is no wall.  You can put your bag under the seat in front of you, its simply set two seat widths in front of you. Ample leg room."
16351,Very comfortable seat. Tons of leg room. Behind a single row first class seat so only one space for under seat stowing of stuff
16352,Seat gets hit by people moving in the aisle
16353,"The window is mislligned on these seats so it is quite uncomfortable trying to look outside. Window is at your shoulder. 

Comments apply to 16F, 17F, 18F and most likely other seats behind. Would also apply the the corresponding A seats."
16354,"Seat is huge, unlimited legroom and you have underseat space in first class seats. 1 window and the tray table is hard to manage. this is for the Republic airlines planes"
16355,I love this aircraft and this seat was very comfortable with plenty of leg room.  I'm a big guy and this is by far the most comfortable flight I have been on.
16356,"Great seat -- no bulkhead, storage under 1st-class seat ahead.  Loads of legroom. Tray table is in the armrest, so you probably lose a little width, but I'm not Kevin Smith, so I don't mind. Overhead bins DO accept roller bags.  Overall, nice, new plane.  Clean, quiet.  Still has a little of that ""new plane smell."""
16357,Good overall seats in front of the wing.  No power outlets or plug ins.  The headrest on 9A would not stay up.
16358,These 2 seats have plenty of leg room. there is not a bulkhead just a curtain between first and mc. 8C is set up that if you stretch out your legs they are in the aisle especially right leg. 8D/F across the aisle have more pitch than first class seats but obviously narrower. Found our seats 8A/C very comfortable These seats are MCX and will cost if you do not have status.
16359,"SFO to LAX, seat 1A. Pro's: individual seat, bulkhead, large amount of leg room. Cons: Only one window, light from galley shines in your eyes (FA on this flight was really considerate about turning it out for this 0600am flight), no overhead bins above this seat because the safety equipment is stored here.  You cannot keep anything at your feet, so board early to stow things in the bin across the aisle.  The ""Eagle's Nest"" / remote terminal at LAX is a nightmare: crowded, chaotic, and only accessible by dirty crowded shuttle buses."
16360,Tons of room in this seat behind 1 class. I am 6'4 and can fully stretch out. No actual bulkhead wall. No power. 2 windows at my control.
16361,Nice individual seat in first class
16362,"Very impressed with these new jets.  Comfortable seats, nice leg room.  I like the fact that there is no barrier in the storage area under the seat in front of you, so your legs and bags are not confined to the same narrow slot.  Quiet and comfortable."
16363,There is a curtain that separates first class from economy and it serves no purpose other than to smack into the legs of the person sitting in this seat.
16364,"Excellent fat seat. Not worth upgrading, in my opinion, hardly any difference."
16365,Very good!
16366,Flew 7am flight from SFO to LAX. Upgrade list is short - but booked seat 8F - and had PLENTY of legroom as there's a big space between the seat and the first class section.
16367,"The legroom was amazing. I am 5'10"" and was traveling with an infant and had PLENTY of room. I can't say there was an extra girth in terms of the seat and it was a little cramped with someone next to me but definitely worth the upgraded price."
16368,"The E-75 in the AA fleet has among the most comfortable economy seats in their domestic fleet. Very comfortable with adjustable headrest. This was right behind first class, so the legroom was fantastic. This is a Main Cabin Extra seat, and well worth the price, depending on the length of your flight. We flew from Reno to LAX."
16369,"I'm sitting on one of these right now and it's very unpleasant. It's extremely cramped and very bumpy.

This is a 3 hour (!) flight. Frankly, I can't believe American Airlines would allow this type of poobox for anything but a regional flight. Maybe they just hate their customers."
16370,"This was a very nice plane and practically new. I wish American would only fly these regional aircraft. The overhead bins are big enough to accommodate roller bags, meaning you do not have to gate check your bag! The seat was comfortable and is the same type as those used on American's mainline fleet."
16371,I flew this plane from PIT - JFK.  Great feel for first class in this commuter plane.  Great service from the FA.  Love this aircraft and would fly it again.
16372,I was seated in 22A and even though its by the bathrooms...I was not effected. Legroom not really that good and its seems a little tight. I would recommend sitting in first class it you have long legs.
16373,"In my opinion, this is the best seat on the airplane outside of first class. 

Leg room is plentiful and as on all the AA E75s, width is great.  Also being upfront you get off quickly and beverage service early enough to actually enjoy it.  So happy AA replaced the awful CRJ200s on this route."
16374,"Very comfortable in coach. Doesn't feel like an RJ at all. Seats were wide and legroom was adequate. I certainly recommend any of the larger (E170 or 190 class) Embraers over a 737 or A320 (and CERTAINLY over a CRJ), provided it's a shorter flight and you don't care about IFE."
16375,"Very comfortable. I highly recommend this seat since it has great leg room, and it has a really comfortable cushion on the seat."
16376,These seats are wider than those on B737s. The main cabin extra leg room is wonderful. This aircraft is more comfortable than B737 for the economy class in my opinions.
16377,"In between windows, you have control of neither.  Good overhead storage space."
16378,"A good seat, (15F). They serve drinks 2 times on my route From Hartford, Connecticut, to Chicago, Illinois. It was sort of bumpy, but relaxing. Always loved an Embraer."
16379,"One of the most comfortable seats I've ever sat in on a flight! We paid for extra leg room, and there was plenty for me (5'6""). Even when the woman in front of me put her seat all the way back, it didn't take anything away from my leg room. The seat was a bit wider than usual too."
16380,"Granted, no one really NEEDS a first class seat for a 38 minutes flight, but it is kind of cute. The seat is similar to most domestic first class seats, with the added benefits of being window and aisle, and the ""new plane smell"". I would not spend any extra money on it. But if you have some miles or upgrade certificates to burn - enjoy the ride!"
16381,"On E175, this seat (as well as 8D and 8F) has first-class legroom as there is no bulkhead separating MCE from First. Aisle seat 8C has no seat in front of it but aisle traffic could be bothersome"
16382,"Seat is pretty standard for first class. Its not overly comfortable but its very roomy. There is only a curtain separating this seat from main cabin so i could see a situation where seat kickers would be a problem. However, since that first row is MCE, it may deter some of the normal rif-raf."
16383,"Very comfortable seat. I was dreading flying nonstop San Antonio - LAX on a commuter jet, because the seats are usually like boards. But the seats on the new AA ERJ-175 are excellent - better than the new Recaro slimline coach seats Alaska (my main carrier) has installed in their 737s. Good job AA on the comfortable seats in an RJ - an unusual accomplishment."
16384,"1A (SFO to LAX) was a fine seat - extra leg room, very private.  1D & 1F would be a little less private, as the flight attendant faces them more directly when in the jump seat. 
New plane, only 3 weeks old, everything in good condition.
The overhead bins on the left (A, C seats) side of the plane are much smaller than on the right.  Overhead space runs out quickly, and there is no gate checking -- checked bags have to be picked up at baggage claim, not at the gate.  Board early, or check your bag.
Overall, this plane is fine for a short flight."
16385,"Window is directly aligned with shoulder, slightly too far back for a comfortable view. If you enjoy watching the ground beneath you, you will have to turn your head completely sideways for a good view and have a sore neck after even a short flight."
16386,"The E175's are brand new planes, at least for AA. For US Air, these tend to be older and well used planes. This is my favorite regional jet because at least some passengers can put carry-on roller board luggage overhead. Note that when overhead bin space is full you must check luggage at gate and pickup at baggage claim. This plane does not offer 'valet"" luggage check at gate like the smaller regional jets."
16387,"I love this aircraft.  If you can get the first row of econ after first class you're in for a treat.  However if you look at the seat width charts you'll see ALL econ seats on these aircraft (e175 and e190, either config) are the widest econ seats AA offers.  Yeah pitch can be a pain but I tend to splurge on the first row of econ and it's usually a short enough flight that I don't need the tray."
16388,"This is the best plane I've flown on for short range travel. Crazy amount of legroom, I was even able to stretch my legs out under the seat in front and this was one of the cheap seats. Very pleased"
16389,"It's unfortunate that there are no power outlets, but otherwise this is a very comfortable plane compared to most regional jets. 2F's seat was comfortable, had a very nice armrest, stable tray table, and ample storage in the seatback in front of it. The plane as a whole is quiet and airy compared to other regionals."
16390,"This was the most uncomfortable seat I have EVER sat in on an airplane. Hard as a rock, didn't recline. It was like sitting in a cafeteria seat you weren't allowed to leave for three hours. Excruciating! And that was after paying extra for Economy Plus."
16391,"Almost brand new plane, seat comfortable and tray was solid and straight. 2x2 seating vastly improves the speed you get off the plane compared to 3x3."
16392,"Brand New E175LR with the new configuration and winglets. Don't let this plane's size fool you, it is a very comfortable ride and packs a punch! 
Seats in Econ are comfortable and now have a headrest that proves adequate for snoozing and sleeping. The interior is modern and spacious, and brand new units have all LED lit interiors. 
The windows are quite large and are larger than some mainline jets. 
Engine noise is fairly subdued, but landing a reversing thrust can get noisy on the E175, especially if you're seated near the engines. 
Another note is that the E175 also have exterior navagation and strobe LED lights as well with the new winglets, and were bright enough to potentially be a bother to some. 

An overall wonderful plane! The new standard in regional fleets, and vastly superior to CRJs and smaller Embrears in terms of comfort!"
16393,"Phl to stl.Flew on us airways now american.Decent seat and service,dirty lavatories"
16394,"Exit row on the E190 are great seats.  As I no longer have status on AA, this is definitely worth the MCE upgrade fee to get exit row with Group 5 boarding.  The SeatGuru review is WRONG - there IS floor storage under the seats in front. Sorry to see AA removing the E190 from their fleet (by 2020)."
16395,Seat 5C is really the best coach seat on the plane.  It has a ton of leg room because it is not behind the bulkhead barrier that is in front of every other seat in Row 5.  Definitely choose this seat if you can.
16396,"Previous comment is correct, seat 2A has a bulkhead right in front of it and there isnt any leg room.  Please change the mark from green to yellow in order to warn flyers to avoid this seat."
16397,"This seat has no legroom whatsoever due to a closet that was added to this aircraft.

The seat should not be marked as green unless they are running various types of this aircraft between old USAir (America West metal) and different American metal.

I have photos to show the lack of space. You cannot extend your legs AT ALL.

AW 2093"
16398,Last row AA E190 seats have 3 inch recline
16399,"For seats 6A, 7A, 8A, and 6F, 7F, and 8F, the window is slightly misaligned.  As it offers no additional perks (like extra pitch), I think they should be downgraded from normal seats to Mixed Review."
16400,This is a great seat.
16401,"Excellent commuter plane!!! I'd much rather fly an E-Jet than those dinosaurs they call MD-80's (fancy way of calling it what is really is a DC9-80.) AA should replace those relics with more E-Jets. Seat 4A is a solitary seat and is very comfortable. I'd say the max distance I'd fly on one of these planes would be 3-4 hours in first and 2 hours max in economy. One of the things I noticed was this plane is extremely quiet and has a good amount of bulkhead space for a ""commuter"" series jet."
16402,"Window seats on this plane are ridiculously cramped. These seats appear to have been designed for people no taller than 5'-0"", who have no arms. As a 6'-3"" man this seat was absolute torture. I would avoid this plane like the plague."
16403,"Luckily, I had both seats for myself, otherwise it could have been a very crowded 50 minuted flight from PIT - JFK. The windows are waist high. A real bummer for someone like me who really enjoy looking out during flights. I would try to avoid this plane in the future."
16404,"Exit row is a standard row and has NO extra legroom. Arm rest is missing and window is not aligned. AA charged me $17 extra for a 'preferred"" seat. Complete waste of money."
16405,"Seat does provide a few more inches in leg room (not much, though). I would agree with many on here (and overheard MANY on my flight saying) that this is the MOST cramped plane I've ever seen in my life. Shame on American Airlines!"
16406,Practically no legroom; very tight on width due to tray table being in the armrest.  The only storage is a small pocket on the bulkhead; all items have to go in the overhead bins.
16407,"This plane is very cramped, for a 2 hour flight, especially if you have to wait to take off. There is little room for luggage, so plan to check even small carry-ons at the gate. There also is only 1 restroom. For a full plane on a moderately long flight, they really need two. I'm going to do everything possible to avoid flying on this aircraft in the future."
16408,"This plane feels like a sardine can. I am 5'2"" and my legs were very close to touching the seat in front of me, and my 6' husband's knees did touch the seat in front of him. Feels so cramped overhead too when walking in. We would not want to ride on this plane more than the hour or so from our regional airport to large connection airport."
16409,"This is an exit row but no extra leg room and no shoulder room, too small of plane for 2 hr flight"
16410,Very uncomfortable seat. Bottom cushion has a hard bump going across the width of the seat such that you have to slide forward in the seat pushing your knees against the seat in front of you.
16411,"I think this is the most cramped plane of any I fly on...seats just seem naaaa-aarow. These CRJ-200's seem to be the only thing that flies in/out of Kalamazoo.  Luckily the flights are mercifully short.  I agree, the windows are tiny and low.  On the other hand, ALL the CRJ's seem wonderfully overpowered and literally leap off the runway...fun times."
16412,"Excellent legroom, probably 37"" on this aircraft.  Has the slightly narrower width due to tray table in armrest.  Good seat"
16413,"This is a good plane. I fly SCE->PHL all the time on AA4186 and it is usually very good. Cabin crew is very nice. The seats are somewhat cramped, but for the short flight it is fine. The other options for most of these AA short haul flights is the DH8 or the Q200/300/400, sometimes the other CRJs. This plane is a bit loud, but if you have to pick between this and the turboprops, this is much quieter. This is about equal with the CRJ900. Overall, good plane, I recommend it, and well done AA."
16414,"Despite being in the exit row, this seat does not have more legroom. I paid extra and was totally ripped off. All the seats on this plane are the same -- shamefully cramped. CRJ-200s are notoriously uncomfortable but AA takes it to new heights."
16415,"I don't expect too much for a 40 min flight. Plane is old and small but for a short flight not bad.  The diagram seems to indicate row 8 has extra room due to the emergency exit.  If it does have more room, it's not inches only millimeters. Also, since the plane is small, is it too much to at least use deodorant?"
16416,I would not bother paying extra for any seat on this plane. It is quiet and rides smooth but it is also small and very cramped. Row 1 is sold for extra $$$ but there is no more leg room. The plane rides smooth but the experience otherwise was akin to being on a Greyhound bus. I will never again pay extra for a seat on this plane.
16417,Row 8 has normal tray tables and are not in the armrest. This is an Air Wisconsin CRJ-200 operated as American Eagle
16418,The seat was very comfortable. It was quiet. It also had a great view out the window of the wing tip.
16419,"Bulkhead seat did have some extra legroom.   This seat was a $24 upgrade when I booked my flight, but I was able to move to it for free when checking in.   

Window is belly height, so you can look down but not much else.  

Our flight attendant was Patrick - great guy and made the flight enjoyable."
16420,"Chose bulkhead seat because I was traveling light (no wheeled carryon) and thought it might provide additional legroom. Nope. Also it bothered me when attendant asked one person to move from front rows to rear of plane for takeoff. What a difference shifting a mere 200 lbs makes I don't know, but sure seems like the aircraft requires extra care and attention."
16421,Small but nice. The flight attendant was very professional. I would definitely recommend this flight.
16422,"Seat 11A seems to have reduced shoulder width due to the placement of the divider between windows. It protruded into my left arm and was very uncomfortable. If you put anything at all in storage under your seat, be prepared not to move your feet for the entire flight. All seats on this plane are cramped, but this seat was particularly uncomfortable for a 2 hour flight."
16423,"The plane is small and with low cabin headroom. People kept bumping their head when getting up. The sits feel crowded if flight is full. Being left-handed, I need to seat at an isle sit on the right side of the plane."
16424,"I only sat in this seat for a short time, because the bulkhead seats were empty so I moved to 1C because my legs are so long.

Originally, a woman had seat 4A, but the FA told her she could move to the exit row since it was completely empty. My erstwhile row mate took her up on her offer, making takeoff and landing much more comfortable for me.

This plane is nowhere near as bad as the reviews I read would have you believe--as long as the flight is not full.

I have to give a big shout out to Tanya, our FA, for being simply amazing. I am a white-knuckler, and se was very good at helping me to relax. She even gave me a big hug when I deplaned. I've never felt so well cared for on a flight!"
16425,"This is not a terrible seat. I flew from Jackson MS to Washington DC on the 6:00 am flight. The flight was about half full.

The flight attendant was very nice and attentive.

The only negative I have is that the seat does not recline at all. Since the window seat was unoccupied, this was not such a big deal for me.

This would be very uncomfortable on a full flight, however."
16426,Worst airplane in American fleet. Exit row seems smaller than the other already cramped seats. Avoid this plane for any trip over 1 hour
16427,I avoid this plane at ALL costs.  The cabin is extremely uncomfortable and small.  Windows are very low so you basically need to strain your neck if you want to look outside.  The Embraer jets are far more comfortable.
16428,ROC to ORD: Seat itself is quite comfortable & roomy.  Overhead bin space remarkably limited but plenty of underseat space - do not take the bulkhead on this plane.  Too noisy in the window seat to listen to music with earbuds.
16429,Short flight from SRQ to DFW.  Temperature was not a problem.  Unable to store even a large paperback book in the overhead compartment on the left side of the plane.  Would avoid this aircraft if possible.
16430,"I was on a short hop from Fort Wayne, IN to Chicago's ORD for a connection. One must keep in mind that this is a small jet. I am grateful to AA to offer business class. I use this airline to get to ORD and DFW and enjoy the business class service. On some of the older jets the seat could use an refresh. But it does offer great leg room and normally good service for a regional jet."
16431,"Seat depth, from back to front is short. Feels like your sitting on a bench seat... lots of leg room, no arm rest on the bulkhead. Pretty much a drag."
16432,"All First class window seats have a misaligned window.  One has to lean forward to see out of it.  Also, absolutely impossible to store anything on the A side of the First Class cabin.
     The flight itself was pleasant, and the FA was very attentive to the needs of the passengers before and during the flight.  This plane is far superior to the tiny regional jets (E135/145) used by AA on short hop flights.  But, it still far from a true first class flight"
16433,"An awful seat, only marginally better than many coach seats I've experienced over the years. There is no overhead space. I almost always check my luggage but for 48 hours I thought I'd just carry my bag on. The seat is not all that comfortable 1st Class is the farthest away from the bathrooms which are all the way in the back. Bad seat, bad layout, bad snacks. Not a good value."
16434,"Very uncomfortable, waste of first class dollars.  The overhead bins are tiny and all bags needed to be gate checked.  Seat belt was too small.  By far, the worst aircraft seat I have ever used."
16435,"no need to buy 1st class, this seat is behind the curtain from 1st class. Don't pay to check baggage. You have to gate check at door of plane."
16436,"View out window very nice,  engine noise a problem, cannot hear cabin announcements during climb, no recline."
16437,Get an aisle seat because the window seats angle down & give little headroom.  Gate check your bag because storage bins are small.
16438,"This is the absolute worst airplane in the sky. Not sure how they could make it more uncomfortable. Perhaps put bus seats in? I get stuck on CRJ's a couple of times a year and really dislike those flights. The seats are narrow, no shoulder room, no leg room. My kids are cool with it though. It is good to be 11, I guess..."
16439,Seat 2A on most CRJ700 s that I have been on has a scratched window due to repeated contact with Jet Bridge shrouds. Visiability is limited at best.
16440,"This could possibly be the worst seat I have ever been seated in on an airplane! Getting hit in the head and shoulders by boarding passengers is a constant. Terrible seat, not worth the extra leg room."
16441,"That has to be the smallest lav I have ever attempted to use. I flew coach, but I was surprised that first class did not have their own lav, had to use the one at the back of the plane. Overall a very uncomfortable plane for a 3+ hour flight."
16442,"Plenty of room in this seat, downsides are that there are no overhead bins on this side of the aircraft. Biggest grumble is that they don't clean the seats - the leather is pretty ingrained filthy. Is it really too much to expect that the seats could be deep cleaned once in a while?"
16443,"Overall i had a very good experience. Aircraft amd seat better than i anticipated. Seat 3A gave me a suprisingly level of feeling of room and privacy, whichni know sounds odd.  Crew was great and cabin was clean."
16444,"The CRJ 700 operated by Envoy Air as American Eagle was better than I expected.  I flew to and from Nashville and Chicago in the same day on this aircraft.  I do not use a roll aboard, and this eliminated standing in the jet way to retrieve a bag.  The seat was as comfortable as the slimline  seats Southwest is using.  The planes were clean, the air vents worked properly, and the beverage service was quicker than on a 737."
16445,"While this seat has leg room, there is no underseat storage for it and it's at an odd location as the aisle runs straight into it coming from first class. Which means, people, carts, etc. also do. I wouldn't choose it again, it's kind of annoying."
16446,"To be honest, plane was terrible. Seat was okay, though dirty. Air vent on the roof didn't work, ac was blowing freezing air into feet all the time, plane was noisy when cruising and seatbacks are too short (I'm 5'9""). Pros that quiet during take off and flight crew collected trash many times."
16447,"This was a relatively short flight from MDH-ORD on a CRJ-700. Seating was reasonably comfortable for economy in a regional jet. Cabin crew was friendly, but there was no real cabin service -- nor was any expected."
16448,"I cannot believe law allows a seat to be so uncomfortable. The back has no lumbar support, the ""padding"" is at most 1"" thick, the experience is like trying to get comfortable in a cardboard box. This is a lawsuit waitin to happen for sufferers of sciatica and other neurological condition. I am a 3 million mile AA customer. If this is an example of the new equipment AA has been promising for five years, count me out in the future."
16449,"The seat was very comfortable! I'm a bigger guy, and I didn't feel cramped in this seat, as it was wide enough, and the leather cushion was fine. The first class service was great - they offered a pre-flight beverage, and 2 in-flight beverages, along with three offerings of snacks. I'm not sure if this is standard, but it was only a 45 minute flight from CMH to ORD. And the aircraft is MUCH quieter than AA's other regional gets like the EMBs. The bulkhead seats did seem to have cramped leg room (of which I in 2A had no issue). The table is a bit tricky to pull out, as it's located inside of the left arm rest. It's a bit heavy, so be careful. All in all, great flight, service, and comfort!"
16450,"I would consider seat 5B to be a bad seat.  It's a bulkhead seat that requires you to put all your items in the over head bin, but the bulkhead is truncated, and that's a problem.  The seat is exactly at the transition point where the aisle narrows from First Class to Economy, and the truncated bulkhead leaves the right half of the seat completely exposed to boarding passengers.  If you sit there you will be repeatedly pummeled by backpacks, shoulder bags, and heavyset passengers."
16451,"Seat 1C has good leg room, but the First Class seats are very uncomfortable - the seat bottom is set at an uncomfortable angle - reclining doesn't help very much."
16452,Leg room is fine...seat is kinda narrow but simply lifting the center armrest makes it alot more comfortable
16453,"There is a slight view out the window, unless the person in 18A reclines or closes the shade. Otherwise this window seat has no window."
16454,"This seat should be red on AA's CRJ 700's with 16 MCE seats. This seat had nowhere close to 31 inch seat pitch. It was more like 29 inches. I'm tall, and the FA took pity on me with me having to sit sideways due to my knees jamming into the back of the seat in front of me, and let me move to the exit row behind. I can manage 31"" pitch sitting straight. Not the case on this seat. This seat may be fine on those planes which do not yet have the enlarged MCE section, but on those that do...stay away!"
16455,"This seat is the best one on the aircraft in terms of leg room (including comparison to the first class seats). Also, it does have underseat stowage, in contrast to the description provided by seatguru."
16456,"This seat 14B was in MAIN CABIN preferred. I used VALET service for my roller bag. Seat was not held bad considering I'm 6'2"" and not petite. Decent support. My neighbor must have not had enough room as they kept encroaching into my space. Let me change this just a bit, tiny but not bad??"
16457,Im 6 foot 5 inches tall and this MCE seat has plenty of room.
16458,"First class is just fine in this 2-row section: modern, comfortable, attentive service on the short ABQ-PHX leg.  Near-zero overhead space for 1st-class, but always able to work something out nearby or valet check the bag.  ANY ABQ filgt is an e-ticket ride on a summer afternoon but if they serve hot drinks, count it as ""smooth."""
16459,Small 1st class cabin is welcome as is non-stop service to Santa Fe from the West.  Plenty of room and service for this short flight.
16460,"I flew with the CRJ-700 from Detroit to Chicago O'Hare. Although the incoming flight was delayed over 40 minutes and no one was at the gate, the flight left pretty much on time and landed early at O'Hare. Because of the small size of the plane the flight felt like a sports car ride. The board service was ok, and the seats were pretty comfortable for a regional jet. All in all it was a great experience, flying with a smaller plane."
16461,Any roller-bag will be gate checked. Overheads are not big enough for a standard roller.
16462,"Seat 16F does have a lot of extra leg room, but there is no arm rest on the right. Having nowhere to rest my arm was somewhat uncomfortable."
16463,"Leg room ok, but neither armrest moves. Seats are listed as 17.3 inches wide, but I believe these two are about 16"". Trays in armrests narrows seat width. Very uncomfortable for large man!"
16464,"Row 8  Seats A,C & D have underseat storage because the ""bulkhead"" is a 12"" curtain.  Seat 8B has no underseat storage.  The tray tables are in the armrest for this row.  Great legroom!"
16465,"Plenty of leg room but armrest by window is short and jabs into side very poor design, if it moved would be better."
16466,Avoid if you are taller than 6'.
16467,"Seats 8A, 8C, 8D, and 8F have exceptional legroom, making them a favorite of frequent travelers.
Seats 8A, 8D, and 8F may store carry-on luggage under seats 3A, 3D, and 3F.  Only seat 8C has no carry-on luggage storage, due to the routing of the aisle through 1st class."
16468,"All of row 16 has tray tables in the armrests. So while you do get the benefit of extra legroom, you also lose some seat width. These seats should be list as green/yellow like other seats with these caveats."
16469,"At best, this a mixed value seat.   Yes more leg work but the 1st class seating is 1 on right and 2 on (see your map).   Ecomony is 2+2.   Sear 8C thus ends up at the end 1st class ailse as it dogleg for 2+2 configure, making occupant of 8C in the direct line bumps, carts, luggage, backpacks, etc.  it is awful"
16470,"I meant to say I had something to add.  I prefer the first class seats 1, 2 and 3.  You have a window view and and isle all at once.  It is a smoother ride as well.  I really hate flying, however if I must fly, I prefer first class and on this particular plane, it works fine for me."
16471,"Because I hate flying, when I do fly on this plane, I prefer first class.  It is a smoother ride and first class seats 1-3, they are really nice as you have a window view and an isle seat all at once."
16472,This is not a premium seat. The curtain drapes over you during the flight and you need tp move your legs each time anyone walks by. Do not bother sitting  here.
16473,Note the seat is between 2 windows and not direct in line with the seat. Cannot see into front window and have to over shoulder to see thru rear window
16474,"I would make 8A, 8D and 8F green due to legroom. The seats in row 4 are far away and even the tallest person would be able to stretch their legs.

8C has unlimited legroom because of the ""bend"" in the aisle, but there is nowhere to put an ""under the seat in front of you"" item. I'd make it yellow."
16475,14A is misaligned with window. Window is very far forward relative to the seat.
16476,"Great seat. Legroom was good (enough to stretch legs. It's one row of first class on one side, 2 rows on the other side. Overall, a good experience!"
16477,"CRJ-900 operated by Mesa, legroom for days"
16478,"Seat tight with minimal legroom. No frills, not even a place to charge ones phone. Table had damaged hinge. Emergency instructions say to use seat cushion as a floating device, yet the seats have no detachable cushions."
16479,Yes the seats are a little narrow but there was PLENTY of leg space. It was about a 2 hour flight and was completely comfortable.
16480,"Probably best coach seat in the American fleet!  So comfortable, and so much leg room i could stretch my legs straight out and not touch the seat in front. Best part, no curtain or wall. Was able to put my backpack under first class seat in front of me."
16481,4F has plenty of leg room and space but sadly did not recline any.
16482,"Sat in seat 11D and it was very roomy, seemed to be
more than a 30-31 pitch"
16483,"The seats in Row 15 (A, C, D, and F) are extremely narrow. The aisle seats have solid dividers up to the armrest, and a protruding metal piece in the window seats will poke you in the hip. If you are skinny - great. Average or a little plump? Don't sit here!"
16484,"Seat has the full rigid ""wall"" armrests and not the liftable ""arm"", so the seat feels narrower than a standard seat. Legroom is outstanding, but if you're tall like me (6'6"") take this seat over the window (16A) as you'd be banging your head on the low ceiling."
16485,"I'd recommend adding a mixed review for any of the exit row seats on newer CRJ-900s and 700s. There are no window shades on many of these planes, which may not be desirable for some passengers."
16486,Avoid this aircraft except during daylight hours. The overhead reading lights provide the illumination equivalent to perhaps a dozen fireflies. Once the main cabin lights were shut off I had to resort to using a flashlight to read my book.
16487,"8D,F are fantastic. You must sit on this side for a lap child. I could sit on the floor with baby. It's also quiet. We had to valet check roller bags. Limited overhead compartment."
16488,Lots of leg room. Definitely recommend this seat.
16489,"The good: I did not realize this was a Main Cabin Extra seat until I sat down...plenty of legroom.

The bad: The window is misaligned.  To see anything you have lean way forward. Other than the window alignment, this seat is ok for a short flight."
16490,Last row on the plane. For a short flight it was not bad. The flight attendant sits in a jump seat in the middle. I had a friendly attendant and spoke with her part of the flight.
16491,"Great plane, good seat. Flew BWI to CLT on this VERY new plane. Cabin crew was very friendly. Even on this short flight they offered drinks but no food. Good seat, like premium economy for the price of economy."
16492,"This seat was a real MCE seat, so leg room was good. It would have been not so much fun though on the width with another person in the seat next to me. He moved to a different open seat. One of the better newer planes in the AA fleet."
16493,Offset window.
16494,Unmovable armrests make for a more narrow seat
16495,"Seat 1A was good with plenty of knee room. My toes were pressed up against the bulkhead but not too bad (I'm 6'2""). Overall I would choose this seat again.  Unlike bulkhead seats in economy class, this does not have the annoyingly narrow seats due to full length arm rests, these are standard business class seats."
16496,"The armrest is missing, the interior wall curves such that it hits your shoulder if you are tall and you have to lean to the right, so if you are tall this is not so good, and the window is misaligned.  But there is more leg room."
16497,"Seat 4A is directly behind 1st Class seating on the port side of the plane.  There is plenty of leg room, perhaps more than anywhere else on the plane.  I was able to store my carry on bag underneath the 1st class seat in front of me.  There is a window to the immediate left of the seat and another window just a little forward.  4A is an excellent choice."
16498,Row 21 is entirely unacceptable and we should have gotten reduced tickets for this on 4/29/18. Extreme noise and very crowded.  there is no excuse for operating this configuration.
16499,"DELTA NEWARK TO HALIFAX Canada   SEAT 4TH  SEAT ON PORT SIDE(LEFT)   SEAT WAS TERRIBLE AS WELL AS LEG ROOM I BELIEVE LESS THAN REGULATION!I COULD BARELY GET MY FEET UNDER SEAT IN FRONT AND IT WAS ANGLED.I AM 6'3"" AND 194 LBS BUT LEAN I WOULD NEVER FLY AGAIN IN THAT PLANE"
16500,"Horrible seat for First Class fare!  small, uncomfortable seat with terrible view of rest room and in direct line of all restroom odors.  Pretty scary flying from Houston to Phoenix (2.5 hours) when weather was rough and stormy.
AA should be ashamed to fly this old run down airplane and still charge premium prices.....Never again!"
16501,"The windows is misaligned at seat 5F, positioned behind your shoulder. There is a large, blank panel where you would expect the window."
16502,"I enjoyed this aircraft OKC-CLT.  1st Class seat comfy, large, good view out window.  FA attentive.  Aircraft was clean.  My roll aboard fit in the 2-seat side overhead bin.  Breakfast was appropriate....but airline coffee is AWFUL...regardless whether Qantas, BA, AA, Lufthansa, Swiss Air...no one gets it right"
16503,"Very old ex US Airways Express plane. Dirty and in bad shape. MCE legroom in row 13 is good, but seat cushion is extremely short and very sparsely padded -- super uncomfortable. Avoid these regional jets if you can."
16504,"Planes in this configuration are former US Airways Express planes with NO upgrades whatsoever. As such, this plane was very dirty and run down. Two exit doors had failing handles. The overhead bins and wall panels were gross. The windows at this row (and most other economy rows for that matter) are misaligned and basically belong to the row in front, so you'd have to lean way forward to look out and hope the person in front doesn't recline. Of course this didn't matter in my case since the window was so dirty anyway I could barely see anything. And for whatever reason, the window shade is closed by pulling up instead of down, with the shade not even closing all the way. Avoid this seat, and better yet, avoid this aircraft."
16505,Really run down plane. Exit door has failing handle. AA really needs to maintain their aircraft
16506,Why would the realign every seat in coach so you are looking at a wide wall unless you lean forward into the seat in front or look back over your shoulder.  This is something they would design in a Saturday Night Live skit.  It kills the enjoyment of seeing out since only the headrests have a view.  Absurd.
16507,"I flew on the CRJ-900 on a flight from ABQ-PHX. Although some people complain about this aircraft there is really nothing wrong with it. Economy seats are fine (and I'm 6""1' so that says allot) and the aircraft is very quiet as long as you aren't in the last 2 rows. Only complaint would be the misaligned windows which are a little annoying. Overall these aircraft are fine. Not near as bad as the people complaining say they are."
16508,Flew the ABQ-DFW route. Most of the windows on this jet are misaligned. If you are looking for a window seat know that half of the window for each row is part of the row in front of you. There is bulkhead immediately next to you.
16509,"Flew from DFW-LIT on Dec 9th 2015. My first time on a CRJ and I was greatly impressed! I thought that this plane would be louder than it actually was, but maybe its because of my seat near the front. Seat was very comfy, the flight attendants were great, and the flight was amazing. Thank you AA!"
16510,"American sells the front half of the Economy Cabin as Main Cabin Extra. Apart from the brand new additions to the fleet, these seats are regular economy legroom, all you are getting is Group 1 boarding."
16511,"This is an awful seat that should be replaced. The actual seat is several inches shorter than normal, i.e. you have no support underneath you from the middle of you leg to the knee. I moved as soon as we got off the ground."
16512,"The worst flight I've been on so far. The seats are a bit narrow. Legroom probably would have been all right had the FAs not insisted that we take off all satchels and purses and stow them under the seats as well.  I have never had to do this on any other flight and on the flight I took -after- this we did not have to do it. Doing so meant there was no room for your feet. By the time we landed my knee was in agony. To add insult to injury the window is misaligned. 
This is a 'preferred' grade seat that I was assigned flying Basic Economy."
16513,For basic price American will not assign a seat & they will not allow any modifications later! I had to guess on the seat assignment to be able to add this comment
16514,"Typical small plane and seats, small carryon room"
16515,Most of windows and seats are misaligned. I asked the attendent why the majority of the seats don't have a full window and she said it was reconfigured to accommodate first class and main cabin extra.
16516,This seat is garbage the wall jets out into seating can't even lean to the side no elbow room whatsoever most uncomfortable two hours I've ever experienced on an airplane JAX-DFW traveled 30 June 2018
16517,"Good seat with plenty of legroom...I paid extra for MCE.

I am 6'4"" and 260# and was comfortable in the seat for the hour or so flight from SGF to DFW."
16518,Narrow seat. Armrest immovable
16519,Horrible seat.  My knees were on the back of the seat in front of me the entire time. I am used to these small regional jets but this one was smaller than the others I had flown. Absolutely horrible. I could not get away from the woman next to me overflowing into my seat area
16520,"I agree with most comments about this plane being sub-par, American has to do something to put them to their standard, poor condition overall, bathroom not operative, worst is that you never know what version the actual plane will be, when I choose this seat it was not supposed to have a seat in front, but it did and the seat was not a Main Cabin Extra as advertised, I get these seats for free because of my status, but if I had paid extra for it I would be real mad. I fly this route often, I have chosen exit row that are not exit rows or wouldn't recline, seat bottoms very short. If I had a choice I wouldn't choose this plane."
16521,Current comment states that it may have limited recline. There is NO RECLINE and the seatback is close to vertical. It is the worst seat I have ever sat in on a flight and this was a very new plane.
16522,Good amount of leg room. Engines were not loud. Great seat for a short (59min) flight
16523,I def would attempt to get a seat in A which is solo. The other two seats across looked quite cramped. Tight but better in A.
16524,"If you're tall & wide or used to first class on your domestic flights, stick with 11C on this small bird.  The right side armrest is attached to wall and very small - hence, widens the seat.  Exit Row is the only place on this plane with any legroom to speak of.  You can survive here for an hour or two without too much pain."
16525,"Considering how small this is, the experience is not bad: the seat is comfortable, tray table works well, everything was in good repair, and the ride was smooth and quiet compared to many regionals. That said, it is simply cramped - there is not much leg room, even less head room if you need to stand, no overhead storage on the left at all and small compartments on the right, and frankly the drink trolley barely makes it through the aisle without hitting everyone's elbows. It's fine for a very short ride (my most recent was CLT-CHO, which is about 75 minutes start to finish), but I would avoid on anything longer than 2 hours."
16526,"Chicago to Sioux City, extremely uncomfortable, 6' tall 210 lbs"
16527,I LOVED this airplane. when you first come to entrance you are shocked how small it is but once fly on it you are hooked.  would prefer over big planes anyday.
16528,"If I have the choice, I'll usually take 1A on ERD and ERJ-140 flights. There's a lot of legroom and it's very easy to get off the plane. It can be a little cold because of the proximity of the forward door. There is no overhead bin next to this seat, so you either have to go to the first full row or, sometimes, the flight attendant will let you put your bag in one of the storage cabinets."
16529,If you fly this type pick any A row except the rear bulkhead. I prefer this regional over any CRJ 200/700 no headroom
16530,The left hand side of the ERJ-135/140/145 is one of the most comfortable rides in an airplane you can have. Does not matter that this plane is small. The A seats are fantastic. Window and Aisle and IMO very good leg room. I rather fly on this in the A seat than a 777 on any trip any length
16531,"The seats on the ERJ 140/145s are the worst I have ever flown in. The seat angle is terrible with no leg room and you can hardly stand straight in the aisles. The turboprops I've flown in are better. 
Get flights on a CRJ if you can. Your body will thank you!"
16532,"This plane was not horrible for the short connecting flight from Miami to Charlotte as the seats were comfy (leather seats) but tight legroom and tight overhead and underseat space. around 8:30 Departure, good to be back in the US after a energy consuming time in Santiago going through extra security and then customs in Miami. But all went well, American Eagle's seats aren't bad to begin with at least."
16533,"I enjoy this plane, and despite its small size, it's never given me a problem. The seats are comfortable and the 1-2 layout is ideal. Engine noise isn't as loud compared to some other RJ's. Gate-checking carryons is inconvenient, but it only takes 5 minutes for them to get brought up to the jetway."
16534,"Regardless of the weather, the first 3 rows on this plane can be very cold!"
16535,"First off, avoid this type of Aircraft if you can. Small, bumpy flight, poor ventilation. The tallest spot while standing up is less then six feet, watch your head. 
Also these planes cannot handle standard carry on luggage. If it's a roller type, you will be asked to check it in.

Good luck in bad weather, our plane was out of barf-bags, hint hint."
16536,"The ""A"" seats on the left side of the 1-2 configuration sit on top of a raised platform (no overhead storage).  The curvature of the side bulkhead and the step down into the isle severly limit available footspace width."
16537,"Seat was comfortable, with no extras.  I'm a little surprised that they use this plane BWI-ORD.  I paid to check my carry-on sized bag as I anticipated little room and didn't want to go through the DAA process.

After some turbulence at the start, the remainder of flight was smooth.  An added benefit was the flight path, coming in over Gary and straight up Lake Michigan with tremendous night views and an almost-eerie silence as the plane slowed."
16538,"This is older plane but it's one of my favorite small RJ's because of the 1-2 setup. The single seats on the left side are comfortable for anyone under 6'2"" or so. A standard rollaboard bag will need to be gate checked. On the whole this is more comfortable than a CRJ or a turboprop."
16539,I flew from JFK-BWI and was crammed into seat 18a.  I will tru to avoid the Embraer 140/145 at all cost
16540,"Was late getting to the plane - my connecting flight was late, my luggage was late coming out of the carousel - had to abandon it and run.  The gate was closed but plane still connected, they let me on.  My original seat of 8A was occupied by someone else - weird.  I was able to sit in 13B and was better off - no one beside me so I was able to stretch out.  Lots of leg room.  No food service though - just cookies.  They should have at least had sandwiches for sale.  No internet service or any entertainment on this flight."
16541,American Airlines approved PET CARRIERS DO NOT FIT under these seats!  I just had to deplane my flight from SYR to PVD because my 19x13x9 American Airlines approved pet carrier didn't fit under ANY of the seats.
16542,Best seat on plane. At least a 40 inch pitch. Perfect for a 67 guy like me.
16543,"Spacious seat. Since the flight was not full, airline offered to reallocate paasengers seats. I had the more room snd it was comfortable"
16544,"All the ""A"" window seats have limited underseat storage. It is less wide than in other planes and an ""underseater"" rolling suitcase will not fit. ""underseater"" suitcases just fit in the overhead, wheels out. Underseaters may fit in the ""D"" aisle seats that are wider. Windows are extra wide offereing lovely views"
16545,The position of the bulkhead leaves limited legroom and no underseat storage.
16546,Great flight on a refurbished American Eagle/Piedmont Airlines ERJ-145.  Seat was very comfortable with all new padding and window is much larger than the CRJ.  Found no complaints at all with this aircraft.
16547,"i flew on a very small 15min flight from Waco(ACT) to Dallas(DFW) on this plane. there is no window right beside you so you have to either lean forward to look out or lean backwards. this is for all the windows on the single seat. i flew on this same plane back in December I sat in seat 4A and once again had to lean forward for the 22min flight from Dallas to Waco. the legroom is okay for a 10 year old i was 10 when i flew on this flight and am only 4' 9"" 110 pounds so i didnt have to wedge in. plane was kinda old (it's 15 years old but with the new livery) so they had the seats elevated and i nearly tripped. so on a scale of 1 to 10 i'd give it a 7"
16548,The Embraer ERJ-145 is a bit noisier and cooler than some of the larger jets but the seating is surprisingly comfortable. I always reserve a seat in row A so I can have my own space; it makes a longer flight easier for someone who's a bit claustrophobic.
16549,Blower right under seat causes feet to get very cold. And i had tennis shoes and socks on
16550,There is a piece of metal that jabs into the bottom of your left thigh due to the configuration of the arm rest connection.
16551,"Nice seat - nothing special, but nice that it is both window and aisle all at the same time."
16552,Avoid this plane on any flight of one hour or more.  No storage space of which to speak.  Very limited recline.  And no food for sale at all on this flight.  Two hours thrity-eight mins. of pure hell.  Shame on AA for using this plane on such a long flight.
16553,"I am 6'7"" and I could stretch both legs out straight under the seat in front of me, so that says something about leg room.  The window armrest on the window-side is smaller but it looked attached to the seat, unlike the comment in seatguru for the seat.  You have a tray table in the rightside armrest and the seat in front of you, so a choice there.  On the A-side of the plane, there is NO above seat storage, so get there early, but I had no problems finding space for a backpack on both flights in this plane."
16554,"While the tray table is in the armrest, the armrest is somewhat moveable."
16555,"8A is a single seat on the left, the overhead bins are on the other side but small. AA usually let you check larger carry-ons and collect at your destination. These regional jets are worked hard and may not be the cleanest later on in the day."
16556,The left hand side of the ERJ-135/140/145 is one of the most comfortable rides in an airplane you can have. Does not matter that this plane is small. The A seats are fantastic. Window and Aisle and IMO very good leg room. I rather fly on this in the A seat than a 777 on any trip any length
16557,"The left hand seats on these airplanes are some of the best seats you can get on any plane, period, business class included.  You get to sit by yourself.  I""d much rather be on these than buried in a middle seat on an Airbus or Boeing.  I ride these things all the time--San Angelo TX to Dallas, Champaign Willard to Chicago, etc."
16558,"Avoid these flights at all costs! The seats are low and at a bad angle. I'm not even that tall, (5'10"") but found there to be no leg room (made worse by the low seats) and limited padding on the seats. Worst airplanes I've flown in."
16559,"WORST SEATS EVER! Actually, let me amend that and just say the WORST PLANE EVER!  Seats are narrower than any other plane I've been on, the aisles super-narrow, and the legroom non-existent.  With that said, the flight staff was awesome.  

This is not a plane for ""fluffy"" people.  I'm not in favor of buying an extra seat for fluffier people in general, but this one is a must.  Either find a flight that has empty double seats, or buy a 2nd seat.  If you need a seatbelt extender, this will not be a comfortable flight.  Doable for an hour, but anything more would be miserable.  This type of plan should be retired."
16560,"Terribly uncomfortable. Minimal leg room, in addition to the seat being lower to the ground than most seats. As a tall (6'1"") person, this meant by knees were angled up even higher than usual, and my backpack on the floor kept digging into my leg because the seat was so low. Honestly the most uncomfortable flight I recall ever enduring."
16561,"Plane should not be used for flights over 90 minutes.  My flights were three hours.  For my STL-LGA round trip, no jetway was used for either boarding.  Passengers carried luggage down stairs to tarmac and placed bags on cart...climbed stairs to board.   Seats and seat pockets were dirty, soap dispenser not working in lavatory, flight attendant proclaimed coffee to be of unknown age.    I have been a loyal American customer but found flights 4133 and 4129 insulting to passengers' sensibilities even in this day of uncomfortable air travel."
16562,"I flew on one of these in august. The seat pitch is 31 inches. Same as a qantas 747 400 or a 380  in economy. I flew from dallas to sydney on the a380 and lax to sydney.  Dallas was a 16 hour flight. Try that in seats like that. Noise is the worst thing about the erj 145, otherwise its comfortable with good windows to look out."
16563,"If you are 6'5"" and weight 250, try to avoid this plane. You will not be sitting down. You will be attempting to wedge yourself in."
16564,Here is another aircraft that should be banned from commercial service.  I was very uncomfortable and the plane was loud.  The seat would be perfect for a munchkin but not someone of my height (6'3).  My knees were embedded into the seat back in front of me and for the two and half hours of flight and ground time.  I couldn't wait to get off this flying sardine can when we reached ORD even though I could not stand up straight until I stepped onto the jetway.
16565,Avoid this seat at all costs. During taxiing before takeoff the loudest most unbearable noise came from this seat. I was pretty sure that my eardrum was going to burst. Avoid the entire back of the plane if you can on this miniscule airplane. I sat in 11A previously and it was a much better option.
16566,"Due to the close proximity to the two doors of the plane, this seat can get very very cold. On my flight, the temp at that seat was 15+ degrees colder than the rest of the plane, so I moved. Flight attendant said this was typical for this aircraft."
16567,I liked the feel of having your own private cabin. There were a couple of downsides. It was significantly louder than the rest of the plane and it was a lot colder.
16568,"I bought seat 1A, as I liked the thought of getting a few extra inches of legroom. However, the seat throughout the flight was uncomfortably cold, and loud. Having the other door across from this seat made it sound as though I was sitting next to the engine. And like others have said, cold. Even the occupant of seat 2A complained about how cold it was."
16569,This seat is particularly cold as it is next to two doors. I had cold legs throughout the flight and also found the meal tray in the armrest to be uncomfortable as it pressed down onto my lap.
16570,"I fly this plane regularly from MIA to CVG.
Rows 1,2 and 3 can be horribly cold especially 1. 

Also I don't ever get the single seat rows (A) because the storage under the seats is very limited and not big enough for a computer bag. Aisle seat (B) is the only comfortable seat.

And they always valet your larger bags so make sure you have something for a computer and other valuables to take on the plane."
16571,Worst airline ever. They charge for everything and the seats are SO uncomfortable.
16572,"For the ""stearage"" customers virtually all airlines have become sardine cans.  In the grand scheme of things the little RJ145 isn't bad at all. I am 6-3 and find this far more comfortable than the ""New American"" fleet coming in. The new 737 is very tight and the A319 horrible. Given the choice, I'll fly the regionals--hard to believe but true."
16573,"Yes, these are getting a little old. Having said that in so many ways I like these. I am a very large man, both in height and diameter. I always take one of the single side seats, put up both arm rests and am reasonably comfortable. Because there is very limited cabin storage, every company that flies these planes does the ""valet"" thing and puts your carry on in the baggage hold."
16574,"This plane is old, but I like it. It's the only plane that has 2-1 configuration to MIA from ATL. The plane is quite loud at takeoff. Bring some headphones for takeoff. The seat was leather which was nice. There is no space for your luggage in the overhead bins for luggage so you have valet service. You drop you bag off and go on the plane. This is really nice since you do not have to lift your bag into the bin. Make sure to pick it up before you leave the gate after your arrival."
16575,"Watch your head when boarding, low height and on the plane when you are getting into seat.  Always go for 'A' position seats, single seat, so you can avoid someone next to you and be even more cramped.  Very minimal cabin bags allowed and no food to purchase. Really noisy plane.  Avoid for any flight over 1 hour if possible.  American Airlines should have ditched these planes years ago"
16576,"Seats very narrow and short arm rests dig into upper thighs for anyone close to full-grown adult.  Flight was over 2 hours(on-time), but these should be avoided for anything over an hour"
